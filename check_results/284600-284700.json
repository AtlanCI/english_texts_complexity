        "text":" The master was an old Turtle   —   we used to call him Tortoise   —  ’\r\n ‘Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’  Alice asked.\r\n ‘We called him Tortoise because he taught us,’ said the Mock Turtle angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’\r\n ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’ added the Gryphon;  and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow!  Don’t be all day about it!’  and he went on in these words:\r\n‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it   —  ’\r\n ‘I never said I didn’t!’  interrupted Alice.\r\n ‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.\r\n ‘Hold your tongue!’  added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.  The Mock Turtle went on.\r\n ‘We had the best of educations   —   in fact, we went to school every day   —  ’\r\n ‘I’ve been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice;  ‘you needn’t be so proud as all that.’\r\n ‘With extras?’  asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\r\n ‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’\r\n ‘And washing?’  said the Mock Turtle.\r\n ‘Certainly not!’  said Alice indignantly.\r\n ‘Ah!  then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.  ‘Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, “French, music, and washing   —   extra. ”’\r\n ‘You couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice;  ‘living at the bottom of the sea.’\r\n ‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’  said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.  ‘I only took the regular course.’\r\n ‘What was that?’  inquired Alice.\r\n ‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle replied;  ‘and then the different branches of Arithmetic   —   Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.’\r\n ‘I never heard of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured to say.  ‘What is it?’\r\n The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  ‘What!  Never heard of uglifying!’  it exclaimed.  ‘You know what to beautify is, I suppose?’\r\n ‘Yes,’ said Alice doubtfully: ‘it means   —   to   —   make   —   anything   —   prettier.’\r\n ‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went on, ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.’\r\n Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said ‘What else had you to learn?’\r\n ‘Well, there was Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, ‘  —   Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling   —   the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.’\r\n ‘What was that like?’  said Alice.\r\n ‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘I’m too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.’\r\n ‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the Classics master, though.  He was an old crab, he was.’\r\n ‘I never went to him,’ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: ‘he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.’\r\n ‘So he did, so he did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\r\n ‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’  said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.\r\n ‘Ten hours the first day,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘nine the next, and so on.’\r\n ‘What a curious plan!’  exclaimed Alice.\r\n ‘That’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the Gryphon remarked: ‘because they lessen from day to day.’\r\n This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.  ‘Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?’\r\n ‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock Turtle.\r\n ‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’  Alice went on eagerly.\r\n ‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: ‘tell her something about the games now.’\r\n\r\n Chapter X\r\n\r\n The Lobster Quadrille\r\n\r\n The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’ said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:  —  \r\n ‘You may not have lived much under the sea   —  ’ (‘I haven’t,’ said Alice)  —   ‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster   —  ’ (Alice began to say ‘I once tasted   —  ’ but checked herself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) ‘  —   so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!’\r\n ‘No, indeed,’ said Alice.  ‘What sort of a dance is it?’\r\n\r\n ‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the sea-shore   —  ’\r\n ‘Two lines!’  cried the Mock Turtle.  ‘Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;  then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way   —  ’\r\n ‘That generally takes some time,’ interrupted the Gryphon.\r\n ‘  —   you advance twice   —  ’\r\n ‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’  cried the Gryphon.\r\n ‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners   —  ’\r\n ‘  —   change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the Gryphon.\r\n ‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you throw the   —  ’\r\n ‘The lobsters!’  shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\r\n ‘  —   as far out to sea as you can   —  ’\r\n ‘Swim after them!’  screamed the Gryphon.\r\n ‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’  cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\r\n ‘Change lobsters again!’  yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\r\n ‘Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice;  and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\r\n ‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.\r\n ‘Would you like to see a little of it?’  said the Mock Turtle.\r\n ‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.\r\n ‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’  said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.  ‘We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall sing?’\r\n ‘Oh, you sing,’ said the Gryphon.  ‘I’ve forgotten the words.’\r\n So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:  —  \r\n ‘“Will you walk a little faster?”  said a whiting to a snail.\r\n “There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\r\n See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\r\n They are waiting on the shingle   —   will you come and join the dance?\r\n"

        "text":" Stener had been in conference with Butler or Mollenhauer, and had been warned and frightened.  Nevertheless, he got in his buggy again and drove directly to the city treasurer's office.\r\n\r\n Since Cowperwood's visit Stener had talked still more with Sengstack, Strobik, and others, all sent to see that a proper fear of things financial had been put in his heart.  The result was decidedly one which spelled opposition to Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n Strobik was considerably disturbed himself.  He and Wycroft and Harmon had also been using money out of the treasury—much smaller sums, of course, for they had not Cowperwood's financial imagination— and were disturbed as to how they would return what they owed before the storm broke.  If Cowperwood failed, and Stener was short in his accounts, the whole budget might be investigated, and then their loans would be brought to light.  The thing to do was to return what they owed, and then, at least, no charge of malfeasance would lie against them.\r\n\r\n \"Go to Mollenhauer,\" Strobik had advised Stener, shortly after Cowperwood had left the latter's office, \"and tell him the whole story.  He put you here.  He was strong for your nomination.  Tell him just where you stand and ask him what to do.  He'll probably be able to tell you.  Offer him your holdings to help you out.  You have to.  You can't help yourself.  Don't loan Cowperwood another damned dollar, whatever you do.  He's got you in so deep now you can hardly hope to get out.  Ask Mollenhauer if he won't help you to get Cowperwood to put that money back.  He may be able to influence him.\"\r\n\r\n There was more in this conversation to the same effect, and then Stener hurried as fast as his legs could carry him to Mollenhauer's office.  He was so frightened that he could scarcely breathe, and he was quite ready to throw himself on his knees before the big German-American financier and leader.  Oh, if Mr. Mollenhauer would only help him!  If he could just get out of this without going to jail!\r\n\r\n \"Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!\"  he repeated, over and over to himself, as he walked.  \"What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n The attitude of Henry A. Mollenhauer, grim, political boss that he was—trained in a hard school—was precisely the attitude of every such man in all such trying circumstances.\r\n\r\n He was wondering, in view of what Butler had told him, just how much he could advantage himself in this situation.  If he could, he wanted to get control of whatever street-railway stock Stener now had, without in any way compromising himself.  Stener's shares could easily be transferred on 'change through Mollenhauer's brokers to a dummy, who would eventually transfer them to himself (Mollenhauer).  Stener must be squeezed thoroughly, though, this afternoon, and as for his five hundred thousand dollars' indebtedness to the treasury, Mollenhauer did not see what could be done about that.  If Cowperwood could not pay it, the city would have to lose it;  but the scandal must be hushed up until after election.  Stener, unless the various party leaders had more generosity than Mollenhauer imagined, would have to suffer exposure, arrest, trial, confiscation of his property, and possibly sentence to the penitentiary, though this might easily be commuted by the governor, once public excitement died down.  He did not trouble to think whether Cowperwood was criminally involved or not.  A hundred to one he was not.  Trust a shrewd man like that to take care of himself.  But if there was any way to shoulder the blame on to Cowperwood, and so clear the treasurer and the skirts of the party, he would not object to that.  He wanted to hear the full story of Stener's relations with the broker first.  Meanwhile, the thing to do was to seize what Stener had to yield.\r\n\r\n The troubled city treasurer, on being shown in Mr. Mollenhauer's presence, at once sank feebly in a chair and collapsed.  He was entirely done for mentally.  His nerve was gone, his courage exhausted like a breath.\r\n\r\n \"Well, Mr. Stener?\"  queried Mr. Mollenhauer, impressively, pretending not to know what brought him.\r\n\r\n \"I came about this matter of my loans to Mr. Cowperwood.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, what about them?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, he owes me, or the city treasury rather, five hundred thousand dollars, and I understand that he is going to fail and that he can't pay it back.\"\r\n\r\n \"Who told you that?\"\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Sengstack, and since then Mr. Cowperwood has been to see me.  He tells me he must have more money or he will fail and he wants to borrow three hundred thousand dollars more.  He says he must have it.\"\r\n\r\n \"So!\"  said Mr. Mollenhauer, impressively, and with an air of astonishment which he did not feel.  \"You would not think of doing that, of course.  You're too badly involved as it is.  If he wants to know why, refer him to me.  Don't advance him another dollar.  If you do, and this case comes to trial, no court would have any mercy on you.  It's going to be difficult enough to do anything for you as it is.  However, if you don't advance him any more—we will see.  It may be possible, I can't say, but at any rate, no more money must leave the treasury to bolster up this bad business.  It's much too difficult as it now is.\"  He stared at Stener warningly.  And he, shaken and sick, yet because of the faint suggestion of mercy involved somewhere in Mollenhauer's remarks, now slipped from his chair to his knees and folded his hands in the uplifted attitude of a devotee before a sacred image.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, Mr. Mollenhauer,\" he choked, beginning to cry, \"I didn't mean to do anything wrong.  Strobik and Wycroft told me it was all right.  You sent me to Cowperwood in the first place.  I only did what I thought the others had been doing.  Mr. Bode did it, just like I have been doing.  He dealt with Tighe and Company.  I have a wife and four children, Mr. Mollenhauer.  My youngest boy is only seven years old.  Think of them, Mr. Mollenhauer!  Think of what my arrest will mean to them!  I don't want to go to jail.  I didn't think I was doing anything very wrong—honestly I didn't.  I'll give up all I've got.  You can have all my stocks and houses and lots—anything—if you'll only get me out of this.  You won't let 'em send me to jail, will you?\"\r\n\r\n His fat, white lips were trembling—wabbling nervously—and big hot tears were coursing down his previously pale but now flushed cheeks.  He presented one of those almost unbelievable pictures which are yet so intensely human and so true.  If only the great financial and political giants would for once accurately reveal the details of their lives!\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer looked at him calmly, meditatively.  How often had he seen weaklings no more dishonest than himself, but without his courage and subtlety, pleading to him in this fashion, not on their knees exactly, but intellectually so!  Life to him, as to every other man of large practical knowledge and insight, was an inexplicable tangle.  What were you going to do about the so-called morals and precepts of the world?  This man Stener fancied that he was dishonest, and that he, Mollenhauer, was honest.  He was here, self-convicted of sin, pleading to him, Mollenhauer, as he would to a righteous, unstained saint.  As a matter of fact, Mollenhauer knew that he was simply shrewder, more far-seeing, more calculating, not less dishonest.  Stener was lacking in force and brains—not morals.  This lack was his principal crime.  There were people who believed in some esoteric standard of right—some ideal of conduct absolutely and very far removed from practical life;  but he had never seen them practice it save to their own financial (not moral— he would not say that) destruction.  They were never significant, practical men who clung to these fatuous ideals.  They were always poor, nondescript, negligible dreamers.  He could not have made Stener understand all this if he had wanted to, and he certainly did not want to.  It was too bad about Mrs. Stener and the little Steners.  No doubt she had worked hard, as had Stener, to get up in the world and be something—just a little more than miserably poor;  and now this unfortunate complication had to arise to undo them—this Chicago fire.  What a curious thing that was!  If any one thing more than another made him doubt the existence of a kindly, overruling Providence, it was the unheralded storms out of clear skies—financial, social, anything you choose—that so often brought ruin and disaster to so many.\r\n\r\n \"Get Up, Stener,\" he said, calmly, after a few moments.  \"You mustn't give way to your feelings like this.  You must not cry.  These troubles are never unraveled by tears.  You must do a little thinking for yourself.  Perhaps your situation isn't so bad.\"\r\n\r\n As he was saying this Stener was putting himself back in his chair, getting out his handkerchief, and sobbing hopelessly in it.\r\n\r\n \"I'll do what I can, Stener.  I won't promise anything.  I can't tell you what the result will be.  There are many peculiar political forces in this city.  I may not be able to save you, but I am perfectly willing to try.  You must put yourself absolutely under my direction.  You must not say or do anything without first consulting with me.  I will send my secretary to you from time to time.  He will tell you what to do.  You must not come to me unless I send for you.  Do you understand that thoroughly?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, Mr. Mollenhauer.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, now, dry your eyes.  I don't want you to go out of this office crying.  Go back to your office, and I will send Sengstack to see you.  He will tell you what to do.  Follow him exactly.  And whenever I send for you come at once.\"\r\n\r\n He got up, large, self-confident, reserved.  Stener, buoyed up by the subtle reassurance of his remarks, recovered to a degree his equanimity.  Mr. Mollenhauer, the great, powerful Mr. Mollenhauer was going to help him out of his scrape.  He might not have to go to jail after all.  He left after a few moments, his face a little red from weeping, but otherwise free of telltale marks, and returned to his office.\r\n\r\n Three-quarters of an hour later, Sengstack called on him for the second time that day—Abner Sengstack, small, dark-faced, club-footed, a great sole of leather three inches thick under his short, withered right leg, his slightly Slavic, highly intelligent countenance burning with a pair of keen, piercing, inscrutable black eyes.  Sengstack was a fit secretary for Mollenhauer.  You could see at one glance that he would make Stener do exactly what Mollenhauer suggested.  His business was to induce Stener to part with his street-railway holdings at once through Tighe & Co., Butler's brokers, to the political sub-agent who would eventually transfer them to Mollenhauer.  What little Stener received for them might well go into the treasury.  Tighe & Co. would manage the \"'change\" subtleties of this without giving any one else a chance to bid, while at the same time making it appear an open-market transaction.  At the same time Sengstack went carefully into the state of the treasurer's office for his master's benefit—finding out what it was that Strobik, Wycroft, and Harmon had been doing with their loans.  Via another source they were ordered to disgorge at once or face prosecution.  They were a part of Mollenhauer's political machine.  Then, having cautioned Stener not to set over the remainder of his property to any one, and not to listen to any one, most of all to the Machiavellian counsel of Cowperwood, Sengstack left.\r\n\r\n Needless to say, Mollenhauer was greatly gratified by this turn of affairs.  Cowperwood was now most likely in a position where he would have to come and see him, or if not, a good share of the properties he controlled were already in Mollenhauer's possession.  If by some hook or crook he could secure the remainder, Simpson and Butler might well talk to him about this street-railway business.  His holdings were now as large as any, if not quite the largest. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXVIII\r\n\r\n It was in the face of this very altered situation that Cowperwood arrived at Stener's office late this Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\n Stener was quite alone, worried and distraught.  He was anxious to see Cowperwood, and at the same time afraid.\r\n\r\n \"George,\" began Cowperwood, briskly, on seeing him, \"I haven't much time to spare now, but I've come, finally, to tell you that you'll have to let me have three hundred thousand more if you don't want me to fail.  Things are looking very bad today.  They've caught me in a corner on my loans;  but this storm isn't going to last.  You can see by the very character of it that it can't.\"\r\n\r\n He was looking at Stener's face, and seeing fear and a pained and yet very definite necessity for opposition written there.  \"Chicago is burning, but it will be built up again.  Business will be all the better for it later on.  Now, I want you to be reasonable and help me.  Don't get frightened.\"\r\n\r\n Stener stirred uneasily.  \"Don't let these politicians scare you to death.  It will all blow over in a few days, and then we'll be better off than ever.  Did you see Mollenhauer?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, what did he have to say?\"\r\n\r\n \"He said just what I thought he'd say.  He won't let me do this.  I can't, Frank, I tell you!\"  exclaimed Stener, jumping up.  He was so nervous that he had had a hard time keeping his seat during this short, direct conversation.  \"I can't!  They've got me in a corner!  They're after me!  They all know what we've been doing.  Oh, say, Frank\"—he threw up his arms wildly—\"you've got to get me out of this.  You've got to let me have that five hundred thousand back and get me out of this.  If you don't, and you should fail, they'll send me to the penitentiary.  I've got a wife and four children, Frank.  I can't go on in this.  It's too big for me.  I never should have gone in on it in the first place.  I never would have if you hadn't persuaded me, in a way.  I never thought when I began that I would ever get in as bad as all this.  I can't go on, Frank.  I can't!  I'm willing you should have all my stock. "

        "text":" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\r\n ‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice, ‘until all the jurymen are back in their proper places   —   all ,’ he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\r\n Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right;  ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said to herself;  ‘I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.’\r\n As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.\r\n ‘What do you know about this business?’  the King said to Alice.\r\n ‘Nothing,’ said Alice.\r\n ‘Nothing whatever ?’  persisted the King.\r\n ‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.\r\n ‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury.  They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: ‘Un important, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\r\n ‘Un important, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, ‘important   —   unimportant   —   unimportant   —   important   —  ’ as if he were trying which word sounded best.\r\n Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;  ‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought to herself.\r\n At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’  and read out from his book, ‘Rule Forty-two.  All persons more than a mile high to leave the court .’\r\n Everybody looked at Alice.\r\n ‘I’m not a mile high,’ said Alice.\r\n ‘You are,’ said the King.\r\n ‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.\r\n ‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.’\r\n ‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King.\r\n ‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.\r\n The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.  ‘Consider your verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\r\n ‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry;  ‘this paper has just been picked up.’\r\n ‘What’s in it?’  said the Queen.\r\n ‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to   —   to somebody.’\r\n ‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’\r\n ‘Who is it directed to?’  said one of the jurymen.\r\n ‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit;  ‘in fact, there’s nothing written on the outside .’  He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’\r\n ‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’  asked another of the jurymen.\r\n ‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing about it.’  (The jury all looked puzzled.)\r\n ‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King.  (The jury all brightened up again.)\r\n ‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’\r\n ‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter worse.  You must have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.’\r\n There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.\r\n ‘That proves his guilt,’ said the Queen.\r\n ‘It proves nothing of the sort!’  said Alice.  ‘Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!’\r\n ‘Read them,’ said the King.\r\n The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  ‘Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?’  he asked.\r\n ‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said gravely, ‘and go on till you come to the end: then stop.’\r\n These were the verses the White Rabbit read:  —  \r\n ‘They told me you had been to her,\r\n And mentioned me to him:\r\nShe gave me a good character,\r\n But said I could not swim.\r\n He sent them word I had not gone\r\n (We know it to be true):\r\nIf she should push the matter on,\r\n What would become of you?\r\n I gave her one, they gave him two,\r\n You gave us three or more;\r\n They all returned from him to you,\r\n Though they were mine before.\r\n If I or she should chance to be\r\n Involved in this affair,\r\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\r\n Exactly as we were.\r\n My notion was that you had been\r\n (Before she had this fit)\r\n An obstacle that came between\r\n Him, and ourselves, and it.\r\n Don’t let him know she liked them best,\r\n For this must ever be\r\n A secret, kept from all the rest,\r\n Between yourself and me.’\r\n ‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the King, rubbing his hands;  ‘so now let the jury   —  ’\r\n\r\n ‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) ‘I’ll give him sixpence.  I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.’\r\n The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\r\n ‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any.  And yet I don’t know,’ he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye;  ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.  “  —   said I could not swim   —  ” you can’t swim, can you?’  he added, turning to the Knave.\r\n The Knave shook his head sadly.  ‘Do I look like it?’  he said.  (Which he certainly did not , being made entirely of cardboard.)\r\n ‘All right, so far,’ said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: ‘“we know it to be true   —  ” that’s the jury, of course   —   “I gave her one, they gave him two   —  ” why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know   —  ’\r\n ‘But, it goes on “they all returned from him to you ,”’ said Alice.\r\n ‘Why, there they are!’  said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.  ‘Nothing can be clearer than that .  Then again   —  “before she had this fit   —  ” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’  he said to the Queen.\r\n ‘Never!’  said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark;  but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)\r\n ‘Then the words don’t fit you,’ said the King, looking round the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.\r\n ‘It’s a pun!’  the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, ‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\r\n ‘No, no!’  said the Queen.  ‘Sentence first   —   verdict afterwards.’\r\n ‘Stuff and nonsense!’  said Alice loudly.  ‘The idea of having the sentence first!’\r\n ‘Hold your tongue!’  said the Queen, turning purple.\r\n ‘I won’t!’  said Alice.\r\n ‘Off with her head!’  the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.  Nobody moved.\r\n ‘Who cares for you?’  said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.)  ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’\r\n\r\n At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\r\n ‘Wake up, Alice dear!’  said her sister;  ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!’\r\n ‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’  said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about;  and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, ‘It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea;  it’s getting late.’  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\r\n But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:  —  \r\n First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers   —   she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes   —   and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\r\n The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by   —   the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool   —   she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution   —   once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it   —   once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.\r\n So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality   —   the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds   —   the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep- bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy   —   and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard   —   while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.\r\n Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman;  and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\r\n THE END"

A page on the Russian social networking site vKontakte calls for \"making it hot for the thieving authorities\".\r\n Russian government supporters rallied on Red Square on Tuesday\r\n\r\n On Twitter, a medium much used by the protesters, a \"6dec\" Cyrillic hashtag has appeared.  The hashtag \"5dec\" was associated with Monday's rally. \r\n\r\n One tweet reads: \"All decent people are asking Santa Claus [literally: Grandfather Frost] this year for a Russia without Putin.\" \r\n\r\n Interior ministry spokesman Oleg Yelnikov told AFP news agency that \"as many [troops] as required\" would police Moscow.\r\n\r\n He said security forces would remain on a \"heightened regime\" of alert until all the votes in the election were counted, adding that some 11,500 interior ministry troops would ensure order across the country.\r\n\r\n A Moscow police spokesman separately told AFP that up to 4,000 police and interior ministry troops would be deployed to ensure order in Moscow alone on Tuesday."

        "text":"Only give me back that five hundred thousand, and we'll call it even.\"  His voice rose nervously as he talked, and he wiped his wet forehead with his hand and stared at Cowperwood pleadingly, foolishly.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood stared at him in return for a few moments with a cold, fishy eye.  He knew a great deal about human nature, and he was ready for and expectant of any queer shift in an individual's attitude, particularly in time of panic;  but this shift of Stener's was quite too much.  \"Whom else have you been talking to, George, since I saw you?  Whom have you seen?  What did Sengstack have to say?\"\r\n\r\n \"He says just what Mollenhauer does, that I mustn't loan any more money under any circumstances, and he says I ought to get that five hundred thousand back as quickly as possible.\"\r\n\r\n \"And you think Mollenhauer wants to help you, do you?\"  inquired Cowperwood, finding it hard to efface the contempt which kept forcing itself into his voice.\r\n\r\n \"I think he does, yes.  I don't know who else will, Frank, if he don't.  He's one of the big political forces in this town.\"\r\n\r\n \"Listen to me,\" began Cowperwood, eyeing him fixedly.  Then he paused.  \"What did he say you should do about your holdings?\"\r\n\r\n \"Sell them through Tighe & Company and put the money back in the treasury, if you won't take them.\"\r\n\r\n \"Sell them to whom?\"  asked Cowperwood, thinking of Stener's last words.\r\n\r\n \"To any one on 'change who'll take them, I suppose.  I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n \"I thought so,\" said Cowperwood, comprehendingly.  \"I might have known as much.  They're working you, George.  They're simply trying to get your stocks away from you.  Mollenhauer is leading you on.  He knows I can't do what you want—give you back the five hundred thousand dollars.  He wants you to throw your stocks on the market so that he can pick them up.  Depend on it, that's all arranged for already.  When you do, he's got me in his clutches, or he thinks he has—he and Butler and Simpson.  They want to get together on this local street-railway situation, and I know it, I feel it.  I've felt it coming all along.  Mollenhauer hasn't any more intention of helping you than he has of flying.  Once you've sold your stocks he's through with you—mark my word.  Do you think he'll turn a hand to keep you out of the penitentiary once you're out of this street-railway situation?  He will not.  And if you think so, you're a bigger fool than I take you to be, George.  Don't go crazy.  Don't lose your head.  Be sensible.  Look the situation in the face.  Let me explain it to you.  If you don't help me now—if you don't let me have three hundred thousand dollars by to-morrow noon, at the very latest, I'm through, and so are you.  There is not a thing the matter with our situation.  Those stocks of ours are as good to-day as they ever were.  Why, great heavens, man, the railways are there behind them.  They're paying.  The Seventeenth and Nineteenth Street line is earning one thousand dollars a day right now.  What better evidence do you want than that?  Green & Coates is earning five hundred dollars.  You're frightened, George.  These damned political schemers have scared you.  Why, you've as good a right to loan that money as Bode and Murtagh had before you.  They did it.  You've been doing it for Mollenhauer and the others, only so long as you do it for them it's all right.  What's a designated city depository but a loan?\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood was referring to the system under which certain portions of city money, like the sinking-fund, were permitted to be kept in certain banks at a low rate of interest or no rate—banks in which Mollenhauer and Butler and Simpson were interested.  This was their safe graft.\r\n\r\n \"Don't throw your chances away, George.  Don't quit now.  You'll be worth millions in a few years, and you won't have to turn a hand.  All you will have to do will be to keep what you have.  If you don't help me, mark my word, they'll throw you over the moment I'm out of this, and they'll let you go to the penitentiary.  Who's going to put up five hundred thousand dollars for you, George?  Where is Mollenhauer going to get it, or Butler, or anybody, in these times?  They can't.  They don't intend to.  When I'm through, you're through, and you'll be exposed quicker than any one else.  They can't hurt me, George.  I'm an agent.  I didn't ask you to come to me.  You came to me in the first place of your own accord.  If you don't help me, you're through, I tell you, and you're going to be sent to the penitentiary as sure as there are jails.  Why don't you take a stand, George?  Why don't you stand your ground?  You have your wife and children to look after.  You can't be any worse off loaning me three hundred thousand more than you are right now.  What difference does it make—five hundred thousand or eight hundred thousand?  It's all one and the same thing, if you're going to be tried for it.  Besides, if you loan me this, there isn't going to be any trial.  I'm not going to fail.  This storm will blow over in a week or ten days, and we'll be rich again.  For Heaven's sake, George, don't go to pieces this way!  Be sensible!  Be reasonable!\"\r\n\r\n He paused, for Stener's face had become a jelly-like mass of woe.\r\n\r\n \"I can't, Frank,\" he wailed.  \"I tell you I can't.  They'll punish me worse than ever if I do that.  They'll never let up on me.  You don't know these people.\"\r\n\r\n In Stener's crumpling weakness Cowperwood read his own fate.  What could you do with a man like that?  How brace him up?  You couldn't!  And with a gesture of infinite understanding, disgust, noble indifference, he threw up his hands and started to walk out.  At the door he turned.\r\n\r\n \"George,\" he said, \"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for you, not for myself.  I'll come out of things all right, eventually.  I'll be rich.  But, George, you're making the one great mistake of your life.  You'll be poor;  you'll be a convict, and you'll have only yourself to blame.  There isn't a thing the matter with this money situation except the fire.  There isn't a thing wrong with my affairs except this slump in stocks—this panic.  You sit there, a fortune in your hands, and you allow a lot of schemers, highbinders, who don't know any more of your affairs or mine than a rabbit, and who haven't any interest in you except to plan what they can get out of you, to frighten you and prevent you from doing the one thing that will save your life.  Three hundred thousand paltry dollars that in three or four weeks from now I can pay back to you four and five times over, and for that you will see me go broke and yourself to the penitentiary.  I can't understand it, George.  You're out of your mind.  You're going to rue this the longest day that you live.\"\r\n\r\n He waited a few moments to see if this, by any twist of chance, would have any effect;  then, noting that Stener still remained a wilted, helpless mass of nothing, he shook his head gloomily and walked out.\r\n\r\n It was the first time in his life that Cowperwood had ever shown the least sign of weakening or despair.  He had felt all along as though there were nothing to the Greek theory of being pursued by the furies.  Now, however, there seemed an untoward fate which was pursuing him.  It looked that way.  Still, fate or no fate, he did not propose to be daunted.  Even in this very beginning of a tendency to feel despondent he threw back his head, expanded his chest, and walked as briskly as ever.\r\n\r\n In the large room outside Stener's private office he encountered Albert Stires, Stener's chief clerk and secretary.  He and Albert had exchanged many friendly greetings in times past, and all the little minor transactions in regard to city loan had been discussed between them, for Albert knew more of the intricacies of finance and financial bookkeeping than Stener would ever know.\r\n\r\n At the sight of Stires the thought in regard to the sixty thousand dollars' worth of city loan certificates, previously referred to, flashed suddenly through his mind.  He had not deposited them in the sinking-fund, and did not intend to for the present—could not, unless considerable free money were to reach him shortly—for he had used them to satisfy other pressing demands, and had no free money to buy them back—or, in other words, release them.  And he did not want to just at this moment.  Under the law governing transactions of this kind with the city treasurer, he was supposed to deposit them at once to the credit of the city, and not to draw his pay therefor from the city treasurer until he had.  To be very exact, the city treasurer, under the law, was not supposed to pay him for any transaction of this kind until he or his agents presented a voucher from the bank or other organization carrying the sinking-fund for the city showing that the certificates so purchased had actually been deposited there.  As a matter of fact, under the custom which had grown up between him and Stener, the law had long been ignored in this respect.  He could buy certificates of city loan for the sinking-fund up to any reasonable amount, hypothecate them where he pleased, and draw his pay from the city without presenting a voucher.  At the end of the month sufficient certificates of city loan could usually be gathered from one source and another to make up the deficiency, or the deficiency could actually be ignored, as had been done on more than one occasion, for long periods of time, while he used money secured by hypothecating the shares for speculative purposes.  This was actually illegal;  but neither Cowperwood nor Stener saw it in that light or cared.\r\n\r\n The trouble with this particular transaction was the note that he had received from Stener ordering him to stop both buying and selling, which put his relations with the city treasury on a very formal basis.  He had bought these certificates before receiving this note, but had not deposited them.  He was going now to collect his check;  but perhaps the old, easy system of balancing matters at the end of the month might not be said to obtain any longer.  Stires might ask him to present a voucher of deposit.  If so, he could not now get this check for sixty thousand dollars, for he did not have the certificates to deposit.  If not, he might get the money;  but, also, it might constitute the basis of some subsequent legal action.  If he did not eventually deposit the certificates before failure, some charge such as that of larceny might be brought against him.  Still, he said to himself, he might not really fail even yet.  If any of his banking associates should, for any reason, modify their decision in regard to calling his loans, he would not.  Would Stener make a row about this if he so secured this check?  Would the city officials pay any attention to him if he did?  Could you get any district attorney to take cognizance of such a transaction, if Stener did complain?  No, not in all likelihood;  and, anyhow, nothing would come of it.  No jury would punish him in the face of the understanding existing between him and Stener as agent or broker and principal.  And, once he had the money, it was a hundred to one Stener would think no more about it.  It would go in among the various unsatisfied liabilities, and nothing more would be thought about it.  Like lightning the entire situation hashed through his mind.  He would risk it.  He stopped before the chief clerk's desk.\r\n\r\n \"Albert,\" he said, in a low voice, \"I bought sixty thousand dollars' worth of city loan for the sinking-fund this morning.  Will you give my boy a check for it in the morning, or, better yet, will you give it to me now?  I got your note about no more purchases.  I'm going back to the office.  You can just credit the sinking-fund with eight hundred certificates at from seventy-five to eighty.  I'll send you the itemized list later.\"\r\n\r\n \"Certainly, Mr. Cowperwood, certainly,\" replied Albert, with alacrity.  \"Stocks are getting an awful knock, aren't they?  I hope you're not very much troubled by it?\"\r\n\r\n \"Not very, Albert,\" replied Cowperwood, smiling, the while the chief clerk was making out his check.  He was wondering if by any chance Stener would appear and attempt to interfere with this.  It was a legal transaction.  He had a right to the check provided he deposited the certificates, as was his custom, with the trustee of the fund.  He waited tensely while Albert wrote, and finally, with the check actually in his hand, breathed a sigh of relief.  Here, at least, was sixty thousand dollars, and to-night's work would enable him to cash the seventy-five thousand that had been promised him.  To-morrow, once more he must see Leigh, Kitchen, Jay Cooke & Co., Edward Clark & Co.—all the long list of people to whom he owed loans and find out what could be done.  If he could only get time!  If he could get just a week! \r\n\r\n Chapter XXIX\r\n\r\n But time was not a thing to be had in this emergency.  With the seventy-five thousand dollars his friends had extended to him, and sixty thousand dollars secured from Stires, Cowperwood met the Girard call and placed the balance, thirty-five thousand dollars, in a private safe in his own home.  He then made a final appeal to the bankers and financiers, but they refused to help him.  He did not, however, commiserate himself in this hour.  He looked out of his office window into the little court, and sighed.  What more could he do?  He sent a note to his father, asking him to call for lunch.  He sent a note to his lawyer, Harper Steger, a man of his own age whom he liked very much, and asked him to call also.  He evolved in his own mind various plans of delay, addresses to creditors and the like, but alas!  he was going to fail.  And the worst of it was that this matter of the city treasurer's loans was bound to become a public, and more than a public, a political, scandal.  And the charge of conniving, if not illegally, at least morally, at the misuse of the city's money was the one thing that would hurt him most.\r\n\r\n How industriously his rivals would advertise this fact!  He might get on his feet again if he failed;  but it would be uphill work.  And his father!  His father would be pulled down with him.  It was probable that he would be forced out of the presidency of his bank.  With these thoughts Cowperwood sat there waiting.  As he did so Aileen Butler was announced by his office-boy, and at the same time Albert Stires.\r\n\r\n \"Show in Miss Butler,\" he said, getting up.  \"Tell Mr. Stires to wait.\"  Aileen came briskly, vigorously in, her beautiful body clothed as decoratively as ever.  The street suit that she wore was of a light golden-brown broadcloth, faceted with small, dark-red buttons.  Her head was decorated with a brownish-red shake of a type she had learned was becoming to her, brimless and with a trailing plume, and her throat was graced by a three-strand necklace of gold beads.  Her hands were smoothly gloved as usual, and her little feet daintily shod.  There was a look of girlish distress in her eyes, which, however, she was trying hard to conceal.\r\n\r\n \"Honey,\" she exclaimed, on seeing him, her arms extended—\"what is the trouble?  I wanted so much to ask you the other night.  You're not going to fail, are you?  I heard father and Owen talking about you last night.\"\r\n\r\n \"What did they say?\"  he inquired, putting his arm around her and looking quietly into her nervous eyes.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, you know, I think papa is very angry with you.  He suspects.  Some one sent him an anonymous letter.  He tried to get it out of me last night, but he didn't succeed.  I denied everything.  I was in here twice this morning to see you, but you were out.  I was so afraid that he might see you first, and that you might say something.\"\r\n\r\n \"Me, Aileen?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, no, not exactly.  I didn't think that.  I don't know what I thought.  Oh, honey, I've been so worried.  You know, I didn't sleep at all.  I thought I was stronger than that;  but I was so worried about you.  You know, he put me in a strong light by his desk, where he could see my face, and then he showed me the letter.  I was so astonished for a moment I hardly know what I said or how I looked.\"\r\n\r\n \"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n \"Why, I said: 'What a shame!  It isn't so!'  But I didn't say it right away.  My heart was going like a trip-hammer.  I'm afraid he must have been able to tell something from my face.  I could hardly get my breath.\"\r\n\r\n \"He's a shrewd man, your father,\" he commented.  \"He knows something about life.  Now you see how difficult these situations are.  It's a blessing he decided to show you the letter instead of watching the house.  I suppose he felt too bad to do that.  He can't prove anything now.  But he knows.  You can't deceive him.\"\r\n\r\n \"How do you know he knows?\"\r\n\r\n \"I saw him yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n \"Did he talk to you about it?\"\r\n\r\n \"No;  I saw his face.  He simply looked at me.\"\r\n\r\n \"Honey!  I'm so sorry for him!\"\r\n\r\n \"I know you are.  So am I.  But it can't be helped now.  We should have thought of that in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n \"But I love you so.  Oh, honey, he will never forgive me.  He loves me so.  He mustn't know.  I won't admit anything.  But, oh, dear!\"\r\n\r\n She put her hands tightly together on his bosom, and he looked consolingly into her eyes.  Her eyelids, were trembling, and her lips.  She was sorry for her father, herself, Cowperwood.  Through her he could sense the force of Butler's parental affection;  the volume and danger of his rage.  There were so many, many things as he saw it now converging to make a dramatic denouement.\r\n\r\n \"Never mind,\" he replied;  \"it can't be helped now.  Where is my strong, determined Aileen?  I thought you were going to be so brave?  Aren't you going to be? "

I'm at the end of my rope.  I don't see any way out just at present.  I've sent for my father and my lawyer.  You mustn't stay here, sweet.  Your father may come in here at any time.  We must meet somewhere—to-morrow, say—to-morrow afternoon.  You remember Indian Rock, out on the Wissahickon?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n \"Could you be there at four?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n \"Look out for who's following.  If I'm not there by four-thirty, don't wait.  You know why.  It will be because I think some one is watching.  There won't be, though, if we work it right.  And now you must run, sweet.  We can't use Nine-thirty-one any more.  I'll have to rent another place somewhere else.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.\"\r\n\r\n \"Aren't you going to be strong and brave?  You see, I need you to be.\"\r\n\r\n He was almost, for the first time, a little sad in his mood.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, dear, yes,\" she declared, slipping her arms under his and pulling him tight.  \"Oh, yes!  You can depend on me.  Oh, Frank, I love you so!  I'm so sorry.  Oh, I do hope you don't fail!  But it doesn't make any difference, dear, between you and me, whatever happens, does it?  We will love each other just the same.  I'll do anything for you, honey!  I'll do anything you say.  You can trust me.  They sha'n't know anything from me.\"\r\n\r\n She looked at his still, pale face, and a sudden strong determination to fight for him welled up in her heart.  Her love was unjust, illegal, outlawed;  but it was love, just the same, and had much of the fiery daring of the outcast from justice.\r\n\r\n \"I love you!  I love you!  I love you, Frank!\"  she declared.  He unloosed her hands.\r\n\r\n \"Run, sweet.  To-morrow at four.  Don't fail.  And don't talk.  And don't admit anything, whatever you do.\"\r\n\r\n \"I won't.\"\r\n\r\n \"And don't worry about me.  I'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\n He barely had time to straighten his tie, to assume a nonchalant attitude by the window, when in hurried Stener's chief clerk—pale, disturbed, obviously out of key with himself.\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Cowperwood!  You know that check I gave you last night?  Mr. Stener says it's illegal, that I shouldn't have given it to you, that he will hold me responsible.  He says I can be arrested for compounding a felony, and that he will discharge me and have me sent to prison if I don't get it back.  Oh, Mr. Cowperwood, I am only a young man!  I'm just really starting out in life.  I've got my wife and little boy to look after.  You won't let him do that to me?  You'll give me that check back, won't you?  I can't go back to the office without it.  He says you're going to fail, and that you knew it, and that you haven't any right to it.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood looked at him curiously.  He was surprised at the variety and character of these emissaries of disaster.  Surely, when troubles chose to multiply they had great skill in presenting themselves in rapid order.  Stener had no right to make any such statement.  The transaction was not illegal.  The man had gone wild.  True, he, Cowperwood, had received an order after these securities were bought not to buy or sell any more city loan, but that did not invalidate previous purchases.  Stener was browbeating and frightening his poor underling, a better man than himself, in order to get back this sixty-thousand-dollar check.  What a petty creature he was!  How true it was, as somebody had remarked, that you could not possibly measure the petty meannesses to which a fool could stoop!\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Top 10 Dumbest Things Recruiters Do: And the Winner Is …\r\n by \r\n Dr. John Sullivan\r\n Nov 28, 2011, 5:18 am ET\r\n inShare563\r\n Tweet\r\n by John Sullivan and Laureen Edmiston\r\n Several weeks ago ere.net published an article that asked the question “what are the dumbest things that recruiters do.”  After surveying recruiters on ere.net,  Twitter, and at the recent SMA symposium in Seattle, it is clear that most feel the dumbest thing recruiters do is…\r\n Not managing the candidate experience  —  the candidate experience is the perception of the sum of interactions with an organization throughout the hiring process.  It includes every communication, the design of the process, the fairness of process elements, the quality of information exchanged, and the honesty with which questions and concerns are addressed.  Providing a poor candidate experience can have many negative consequences, including an increased candidate dropout rate, negative word-of-mouth, and decreased loyalty to the overall brand.\r\n The rest of the “Top 10” are…\r\n Expecting dull position descriptions to attract  —  potential applicants assume that the company puts its best foot forward when it describes a job.  So when they compare your dull, legalistic description with your competitor’s more compelling description, they will simply apply elsewhere.  The net result is that you lose candidates unnecessarily, harm your employer brand, and you will eventually frustrate your hiring managers.\r\n Not taking advantage of employee referrals  —  the best-practice firms approach 50% referral hires (the percentage of all external hires who come from referrals).  Failing to fully use referrals means that you will miss out on a large number of high-quality, prescreened, and presold candidates.  Because employees are no longer doing some of the recruiting work, your recruiting workload will increase.\r\n Not learning the business  —  obviously if you can’t speak “their language” and you don’t understand their problems, hiring managers will be less responsive to your requests.  Your lack of knowledge will also make it more difficult to communicate with, to sell, and to build relationships with candidates.\r\n Using the same recruiting process for different level jobs  —  higher-level jobs require a different level of service, knowledge, and relationship-building.  So using the same process that you use for lower-level jobs on more sophisticated, technical, or management jobs will result in fewer returned calls, a higher candidate dropout rate, and lower-quality hires.\r\n Making slow hiring decisions  —  the very best candidates are gone quickly, so a drawn-out process or slow decision-making will likely mean that candidates with multiple offers will be gone.  Managers will also become frustrated if a slow recruiting process means losing the best.\r\n Assuming interviews are accurate  —  interviews are traditionally weak predictors but poorly executed interviews dramatically increase the chances of making a major hiring error.  Poorly designed interviews may also screen out innovators and turnoff top candidates, because they have not felt challenged.\r\n Using active sourcing approaches for passive candidates  —  posting your jobs using active sourcing approaches like job boards, newspaper ads, and job fairs means that the 75% of the workforce that is not actively looking for a job will never see them.\r\n Not prioritizing jobs  —  focusing on low-value jobs with little business or revenue impact will anger your managers and reduce their business results.  It may eventually lead to lower recruiting budgets, after executives see that your hiring is not prioritized and in line with their business priorities.\r\n Not identifying job acceptance criteria  —  if you don’t proactively ask for their job acceptance criteria, you can only guess about what it will take to get a top candidate to say “yes.”  Although it is ranked as #10, not tailoring your recruiting marketing and candidate-selling approaches to the decision criteria of top candidates almost guarantees that you will lose these candidates.  Because these individuals have choices, they will simply wait until an opportunity comes along that precisely fits their requirements and expectations.\r\n Final Thoughts\r\n Nearly 80% of CEOs select talent management as the business area that requires the most change.  As a recruiter, if you are going to dramatically change, you have only two basic choices, 1) stop doing the dumb things that negatively impact your results or 2) start doing smarter and more effective things.  The “stop doing dumb things” choice is probably the easier of the two because it doesn’t require you to learn anything new.\r\n So if you are recruiter or recruiting manager with limited time and resources, we recommend that you use this “dumb things” list to begin the process of changing and improving your recruiting."

        "text":"\"You go back to Mr. Stener, Albert, and tell him that it can't be done.  The certificates of loan were purchased before his order arrived, and the records of the exchange will prove it.  There is no illegality here.  I am entitled to that check and could have collected it in any qualified court of law.  The man has gone out of his head.  I haven't failed yet.  You are not in any danger of any legal proceedings;  and if you are, I'll help defend you.  I can't give you the check back because I haven't it to give;  and if I had, I wouldn't.  That would be allowing a fool to make a fool of me.  I'm sorry, very, but I can't do anything for you.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, Mr. Cowperwood!\"  Tears were in Stires's eyes.  \"He'll discharge me!  He'll forfeit my sureties.  I'll be turned out into the street.  I have only a little property of my own—outside of my salary!\"\r\n\r\n He wrung his hands, and Cowperwood shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n \"This isn't as bad as you think, Albert.  He won't do what he says.  He can't.  It's unfair and illegal.  You can bring suit and recover your salary.  I'll help you in that as much as I'm able.  But I can't give you back this sixty-thousand-dollar check, because I haven't it to give.  I couldn't if I wanted to.  It isn't here any more.  I've paid for the securities I bought with it.  The securities are not here.  They're in the sinking-fund, or will be.\"\r\n\r\n He paused, wishing he had not mentioned that fact.  It was a slip of the tongue, one of the few he ever made, due to the peculiar pressure of the situation.  Stires pleaded longer.  It was no use, Cowperwood told him.  Finally he went away, crestfallen, fearsome, broken.  There were tears of suffering in his eyes.  Cowperwood was very sorry.  And then his father was announced.\r\n\r\n The elder Cowperwood brought a haggard face.  He and Frank had had a long conversation the evening before, lasting until early morning, but it had not been productive of much save uncertainty.\r\n\r\n \"Hello, father!\"  exclaimed Cowperwood, cheerfully, noting his father's gloom.  He was satisfied that there was scarcely a coal of hope to be raked out of these ashes of despair, but there was no use admitting it.\r\n\r\n \"Well?\"  said his father, lifting his sad eyes in a peculiar way.\r\n\r\n \"Well, it looks like stormy weather, doesn't it?  I've decided to call a meeting of my creditors, father, and ask for time.  There isn't anything else to do.  I can't realize enough on anything to make it worth while talking about.  I thought Stener might change his mind, but he's worse rather than better.  His head bookkeeper just went out of here.\"\r\n\r\n \"What did he want?\"  asked Henry Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n \"He wanted me to give him back a check for sixty thousand that he paid me for some city loan I bought yesterday morning.\"  Frank did not explain to his father, however, that he had hypothecated the certificates this check had paid for, and used the check itself to raise money enough to pay the Girard National Bank and to give himself thirty-five thousand in cash besides.\r\n\r\n \"Well, I declare!\"  replied the old man.  \"You'd think he'd have better sense than that.  That's a perfectly legitimate transaction.  When did you say he notified you not to buy city loan?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yesterday noon.\"\r\n\r\n \"He's out of his mind,\" Cowperwood, Sr., commented, laconically.\r\n\r\n \"It's Mollenhauer and Simpson and Butler, I know.  They want my street-railway lines.  Well, they won't get them.  They'll get them through a receivership, and after the panic's all over.  Our creditors will have first chance at these.  If they buy, they'll buy from them.  If it weren't for that five-hundred-thousand-dollar loan I wouldn't think a thing of this.  My creditors would sustain me nicely.  But the moment that gets noised around! ...  And this election!  I hypothecated those city loan certificates because I didn't want to get on the wrong side of Davison.  I expected to take in enough by now to take them up.  They ought to be in the sinking-fund, really.\"\r\n\r\n The old gentleman saw the point at once, and winced.\r\n\r\n \"They might cause you trouble, there, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n \"It's a technical question,\" replied his son.  \"I might have been intending to take them up.  As a matter of fact, I will if I can before three.  I've been taking eight and ten days to deposit them in the past.  In a storm like this I'm entitled to move my pawns as best I can.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood, the father, put his hand over his mouth again.  He felt very disturbed about this.  He saw no way out, however.  He was at the end of his own resources.  He felt the side-whiskers on his left cheek.  He looked out of the window into the little green court.  Possibly it was a technical question, who should say.  The financial relations of the city treasury with other brokers before Frank had been very lax.  Every banker knew that.  Perhaps precedent would or should govern in this case.  He could not say.  Still, it was dangerous—not straight.  If Frank could get them out and deposit them it would be so much better.\r\n\r\n \"I'd take them up if I were you and I could,\" he added.\r\n\r\n \"I will if I can.\"\r\n\r\n \"How much money have you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, twenty thousand, all told.  If I suspend, though, I'll have to have a little ready cash.\"\r\n\r\n \"I have eight or ten thousand, or will have by night, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n He was thinking of some one who would give him a second mortgage on his house.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood looked quietly at him.  There was nothing more to be said to his father.  \"I'm going to make one more appeal to Stener after you leave here,\" be said.  \"I'm going over there with Harper Steger when he comes.  If he won't change I'll send out notice to my creditors, and notify the secretary of the exchange.  I want you to keep a stiff upper lip, whatever happens.  I know you will, though.  I'm going into the thing head down.  If Stener had any sense—\" He paused.  \"But what's the use talking about a damn fool?\"\r\n\r\n He turned to the window, thinking of how easy it would have been, if Aileen and he had not been exposed by this anonymous note, to have arranged all with Butler.  Rather than injure the party, Butler, in extremis, would have assisted him.  Now...!\r\n\r\n His father got up to go.  He was as stiff with despair as though he were suffering from cold.\r\n\r\n \"Well,\" he said, wearily.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood suffered intensely for him.  What a shame!  His father!  He felt a great surge of sorrow sweep over him but a moment later mastered it, and settled to his quick, defiant thinking.  As the old man went out, Harper Steger was brought in.  They shook hands, and at once started for Stener's office.  But Stener had sunk in on himself like an empty gas-bag, and no efforts were sufficient to inflate him.  They went out, finally, defeated.\r\n\r\n \"I tell you, Frank,\" said Steger, \"I wouldn't worry.  We can tie this thing up legally until election and after, and that will give all this row a chance to die down.  Then you can get your people together and talk sense to them.  They're not going to give up good properties like this, even if Stener does go to jail.\"\r\n\r\n Steger did not know of the sixty thousand dollars' worth of hypothecated securities as yet.  Neither did he know of Aileen Butler and her father's boundless rage. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXX\r\n\r\n There was one development in connection with all of this of which Cowperwood was as yet unaware.  The same day that brought Edward Butler the anonymous communication in regard to his daughter, brought almost a duplicate of it to Mrs. Frank Algernon Cowperwood, only in this case the name of Aileen Butler had curiously been omitted.\r\n\r\n Perhaps you don't know that your husband is running with another woman.  If you don't believe it, watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street.\r\n\r\n Mrs. Cowperwood was in the conservatory watering some plants when this letter was brought by her maid Monday morning.  She was most placid in her thoughts, for she did not know what all the conferring of the night before meant.  Frank was occasionally troubled by financial storms, but they did not see to harm him.\r\n\r\n \"Lay it on the table in the library, Annie.  I'll get it.\"\r\n\r\n She thought it was some social note.\r\n\r\n In a little while (such was her deliberate way), she put down her sprinkling-pot and went into the library.  There it was lying on the green leather sheepskin which constituted a part of the ornamentation of the large library table.  She picked it up, glanced at it curiously because it was on cheap paper, and then opened it.  Her face paled slightly as she read it;  and then her hand trembled—not much.  Hers was not a soul that ever loved passionately, hence she could not suffer passionately.  She was hurt, disgusted, enraged for the moment, and frightened;  but she was not broken in spirit entirely.  Thirteen years of life with Frank Cowperwood had taught her a number of things.  He was selfish, she knew now, self-centered, and not as much charmed by her as he had been.  The fear she had originally felt as to the effect of her preponderance of years had been to some extent justified by the lapse of time.  Frank did not love her as he had—he had not for some time;  she had felt it.  What was it? —she had asked herself at times—almost, who was it?  Business was engrossing him so.\r\n\r\n Finance was his master.  Did this mean the end of her regime, she queried.  Would he cast her off?  Where would she go?  What would she do?  She was not helpless, of course, for she had money of her own which he was manipulating for her.  Who was this other woman?  Was she young, beautiful, of any social position?  Was it—?  Suddenly she stopped.  Was it?  Could it be, by any chance—her mouth opened—Aileen Butler?\r\n\r\n She stood still, staring at this letter, for she could scarcely countenance her own thought.  She had observed often, in spite of all their caution, how friendly Aileen had been to him and he to her.  He liked her;  he never lost a chance to defend her.  Lillian had thought of them at times as being curiously suited to each other temperamentally.  He liked young people.  But, of course, he was married, and Aileen was infinitely beneath him socially, and he had two children and herself.  And his social and financial position was so fixed and stable that he did not dare trifle with it.  Still she paused;  for forty years and two children, and some slight wrinkles, and the suspicion that we may be no longer loved as we once were, is apt to make any woman pause, even in the face of the most significant financial position.  Where would she go if she left him?  What would people think?  What about the children?  Could she prove this liaison?  Could she entrap him in a compromising situation?  Did she want to?\r\n\r\n She saw now that she did not love him as some women love their husbands.  She was not wild about him.  In a way she had been taking him for granted all these years, had thought that he loved her enough not to be unfaithful to her;  at least fancied that he was so engrossed with the more serious things of life that no petty liaison such as this letter indicated would trouble him or interrupt his great career.  Apparently this was not true.  What should she do?  What say?  How act?  Her none too brilliant mind was not of much service in this crisis.  She did not know very well how either to plan or to fight.\r\n\r\n The conventional mind is at best a petty piece of machinery.  It is oyster-like in its functioning, or, perhaps better, clam-like.  It has its little siphon of thought-processes forced up or down into the mighty ocean of fact and circumstance;  but it uses so little, pumps so faintly, that the immediate contiguity of the vast mass is not disturbed.  Nothing of the subtlety of life is perceived.  No least inkling of its storms or terrors is ever discovered except through accident.  When some crude, suggestive fact, such as this letter proved to be, suddenly manifests itself in the placid flow of events, there is great agony or disturbance and clogging of the so-called normal processes.  The siphon does not work right.  It sucks in fear and distress.  There is great grinding of maladjusted parts—not unlike sand in a machine—and life, as is so often the case, ceases or goes lamely ever after.\r\n\r\n Mrs. Cowperwood was possessed of a conventional mind.  She really knew nothing about life.  And life could not teach her.  Reaction in her from salty thought-processes was not possible.  She was not alive in the sense that Aileen Butler was, and yet she thought that she was very much alive.  All illusion.  She wasn't.  She was charming if you loved placidity.  If you did not, she was not.  She was not engaging, brilliant, or forceful.  Frank Cowperwood might well have asked himself in the beginning why he married her.  He did not do so now because he did not believe it was wise to question the past as to one's failures and errors.  It was, according to him, most unwise to regret.  He kept his face and thoughts to the future.\r\n\r\n But Mrs. Cowperwood was truly distressed in her way, and she went about the house thinking, feeling wretchedly.  She decided, since the letter asked her to see for herself, to wait.  She must think how she would watch this house, if at all.  Frank must not know.  If it were Aileen Butler by any chance—but surely not—she thought she would expose her to her parents.  Still, that meant exposing herself.  She determined to conceal her mood as best she could at dinner-time—but Cowperwood was not able to be there.  He was so rushed, so closeted with individuals, so closely in conference with his father and others, that she scarcely saw him this Monday night, nor the next day, nor for many days.\r\n\r\n For on Tuesday afternoon at two-thirty he issued a call for a meeting of his creditors, and at five-thirty he decided to go into the hands of a receiver.  And yet, as he stood before his principal creditors—a group of thirty men—in his office, he did not feel that his life was ruined.  He was temporarily embarrassed.  Certainly things looked very black.  The city-treasurership deal would make a great fuss.  Those hypothecated city loan certificates, to the extent of sixty thousand, would make another, if Stener chose.  Still, he did not feel that he was utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\n"

Convergence and mixing were judged by eye and with plots of the modified Gelman-Rubin statistic [35].\r\n Finally, effects on seagrass recovery (daily gap contraction rate) were evaluated by fitting a linear mixed effects model with “site” as a random offset, after excluding no clearing (Control) plots (which had no gaps, resulting in a mean and variance = 0).\r\n Identifying factors(s) predicting the risk for sudden seagrass disturbance\r\n To our surprise, gaps in three treatment combinations expanded on average instead of contracting during October;  in Large clearings with and without lugworm addition, and Medium-sized clearings with lugworm addition (see Results).  This effect was due to an additional disturbance on the seagrass that had recolonized plots subjected to these initial treatment combinations.  Meanwhile, the recolonizing seagrass in other treatment plots were not impacted, and the gaps closed up completely.  Even though this unanticipated pattern of additional disturbance was ultimately caused by an interaction between Clearing size and Lugworm addition (see Results), we wanted to in greater detail understand what factor(s) or conditions triggered this disturbance (e.g. the engineers or their effects), and thereby try to identify the additional disturbance.  To identify what local conditions triggered the additional disturbance, we gathered plot-specific data on five potentially important variables serendipitously collected just before the additional disturbance (early October).  The variables were (i) seagrass gap size and (ii) lugworm fecal cast density (reflecting the two treatments);  (iii) seagrass ground cover (%) in recolonized areas, which may influence self-facilitation (cover estimated from the plot photographs using standard digitizing [see 36]), (iv) the elevation of the area surrounding each plot, (measured in August, see above), which may influence exposure, and (v) the size of hollows (water-logged low-tide depressions) encircling the gaps created by the seagrass clearing;  a measure of the spatial extent of sediment erosion (estimated from plot photographs, see Methods;  Field experiment) (For a summary of all data, see Fig.  S3).  These variables were then used as predictors in a multiple logistic regression model with “risk for disturbance” as response variable (where 0 = no gap expansion, and 1 = gap expansion, n = 48).  “Site” (two levels) was included as a random offset to reduce the influence of natural variation (using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R).  As “gap size” and “hollow size” were highly correlated (Pearson rho = 0.88), we removed “gap size” (regarded less important because the disturbance occurred outside the gaps but in the hollows).  The minimal adequate model was identified as described above.\r\n\r\n Results\r\n Field survey\r\n In June, hummocks were 5.81±0.5 cm (mean ± SE) higher than hollows (one-sided t-test;  t6 = 12.41, P"

Police have organised funding to buy 10,000 sweeties which officers will keep with their radios and hi-viz vests to give to students as they weave their way home from late nights out.\r\n\r\n The idea has been tried in a limited fashion elsewhere, but this time, in the centre of Durham, it has the added sophistication of messages on each sweet, in the style of seaside rock.  They tell their consumers 'Quiet, please' and 'Shush.'\r\n\r\n They are going to be handed out in any instances where officers feel that the young people might be going to make a noise and disturb local people asleep in their homes.  Durham is famous for its number of students and also for hills and large, ancient buildings which amplify street noise when it does occur.\r\n\r\n The sweetie handout follows complaints since the beginning of the current academic year about too much exuberant celebration going on.  Insp Paul Anderson, of Durham Police says: \r\n\r\n  The idea of handing out sweets or lollipops at the end of the night has been done in other areas, but we think Durham is the first to include a message aimed at those who might otherwise make a racket.\r\n\r\n Late night noise is a genuine issue for a number of our residents and we hope that this initiative will make a difference.  It also provides another way for our officers to engage with students and other revellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n Funding for the sweets came from Durham County Council, the city's Pub Watch scheme, Durham University and the local campus of Teikyo University which gives Japanese students the chance of a year at a UK campus, with all that that implies.\r\n\r\n Posted by \r\n Martin Wainwright \r\n Monday 5 December 2011 11.00 GMT \r\n guardian.co.uk \r\n Article history"

Most people own their own cars, but not everyone can foot the bill for the car, plus the insurance, gas, and maintenance.  Most big cities have buses, but they are much slower than a car.  Several cities in the U.S. have subway systems, but many do not.  There are even fewer trains that transport daily commuters.  In cities such as Los Angeles, public transportation is much more limited than in other countries.\r\n\r\n If you take some form of public transportation, you need to pay a certain fare.  In most big cities the fare is anywhere from 1 to 2 dollars.  But don't expect the bus driver to change a bill for you.  You usually need exact change if you're going to ride a bus, train, or subway.  Whatever you take, you always have to pay for it!\r\n\r\n My friends here in Los Angeles all have different ways of getting to work.  One friend, who lives out in the boonies, rides the train everyday.  He takes the train because it's easier for him than driving or taking a bus.  Another friend I know who works close to where he lives rides a bike everyday.  Still another friend drives his car.

        "text":"Things at polling station #2390, an old school in Yasenevo, a sleepy bedroom community bristling with high rises on the far southwestern fringe of Moscow, finally got interesting long after the ladies in aprons folded up the snack bar and the voters had wandered home through the rain and the dark.  That was when five members of the local election commission — all teachers and administrators at the school — began to count the ballots cast that day in the country’s parliamentary elections.\r\n\r\n It had been a tense couple of months going into the vote.  The ruling United Russia party, created in 2001 to support Vladimir Putin, who was then the President and is now Prime Minister, had been steadily, swiftly sinking in the polls;  Putin, despite his high approval ratings, was being publicly booed.  After he and Dmitry Medvedev announced, in September, that they would trade places, giving the Presidency back to Putin, people seemed to be in a sour mood — a mood to protest and do what Russians, especially the educated and cosmopolitan among them, never do: vote.  In response, the Kremlin appeared to panic, and cracked down, harassing election monitors.  On election day itself, there were denial-of-service attacks on prominent media outlets and on LiveJournal, the country’s most important blogging platform.\r\n\r\n With that behind them, and the voters gone, Yasenevo’s electoral commissioners and observers — representatives sent by the various parties to monitor the vote, as well as this correspondent — got to work.\r\n\r\n First, the commissioners counted and recounted the unused ballots and wrapped them up in brown paper.  And that’s when all friendliness and camaraderie between the commission and the observers went out the door, and all the tension of the election season bubbled out.  One of the commissioners at precinct #2390, Valentina Remezova, a blonde woman in her fifties, was offended by the very idea of observers: she clasped her hands to her chest and exclaimed, “I don’t understand this.  I feel like I’ve committed a crime!”  It was something she would repeat later, with tears in her voice, when the observers and I tried to get close to the table where the paper ballots were dumped from the white plastic ballot boxes.  “Where does this distrust come from?”  she said.  “You’re making me feel like a criminal.  All day you’ve been doing this!”\r\n\r\n “Why are you taking this so personally?”  said Julia Dobrokhotova, an observer from the liberal Yabloko party, who lives next door to the school (she is also a friend of mine).  “We’re just here to see that everything is done properly.  It has nothing to do with you!”\r\n\r\n I tried to photograph the proceedings — something that, by Russian law, I am allowed to do.  “You cannot photograph here,” said Alexei Kachubei, a slight man with a slight lisp, and the head of the election commission as well as the school principal.  When Dobrokhotova pointed out that I was, in fact, allowed to, he said that I couldn’t photograph faces.  Next he said I could photograph but not make a video recording.  Then I couldn’t photograph at all;  I had to stand twenty meters from the table, which would have put me outside the room.  He called in one of the policemen overseeing the elections, a young man with a bleary, red face and dim eyes.\r\n\r\n “You cannot photograph the ballots,” he told me when I explained that I had abided by the commission head’s request not to photograph faces.  “They are a state secret.”\r\n\r\n This unleashed an argument among the observers, at which point another commission member, a man in jeans and a gray sweater with friendly snowflakes stretched across his belly, decided to put an end to the argument.\r\n\r\n “You shut up,” he barked.  “Yabloko was created with American money!”\r\n\r\n When I asked him for his name, he snorted.  “Not likely!  Especially to an American.”  (I was born in Russia, but am an American citizen.)  Then he covered the official (and stamped) name tag was wearing.  Later, it disappeared altogether.  He was, it turns out, a veteran of the Russian foreign-intelligence service.\r\n\r\n “This is why you left Russia,” another fifty-something commission member said.  “Because we do things by the rules and you people don’t like that.”  She was writing down the details of my passport and Foreign Ministry press-accreditation card out at a desk in the hallway — a good way to remove me from the ballot-counting room.\r\n\r\n When I was in the room, though, and even when confined to a desk, I could see the neat stacks of ballots, perfectly and evenly folded, that slipped out from between the sea of ballots spilling out of each box as it was cracked open.  (I presume this is why no photographs were wanted.)  Despite my frantic pointing, observers missed the first batch, quickly spread around by the commission members’ able hands, but they appeared, unmistakably and suspiciously neat, in each subsequent ballot box.\r\n\r\n “Stop!  Stop!”  Dobrokhotova yelled.  “Stop counting!  These are stuffed!”\r\n\r\n The one person able to stop the flurry of hands smoothing out the pile was a bewigged and less than lucid seventy-one-year-old Yevgenia Leneva, a commission and Communist Party member.  Leneva grabbed the perfect pack and yelled, “Look at this stack!”  As the observers and the commission screamed at each other, she carefully unfolded the ballots, and said, “They’re all for United Russia!  Of course!  Who else stuffs the ballot boxes?”\r\n\r\n Kachubei, the commission chair, grabbed part of the stack out of her hand.  The young policeman took care of the rest: as Leneva screeched, he attacked, wrenching the ballots out of her hand, and leaving a long bruise on her papery arm.  When the deputy head of the local police precinct arrived (he had been called to deal with me, not voter fraud), Leneva made sure to complain about her bruised arm.  The colonel was unmoved — hadn’t Leneva overstepped her authority?  — and one of the women on the commission made sure to chime in, “Oh, come on.  You told us yesterday your arm hurt!”\r\n\r\n In the end, Yasenevo’s election precinct #2390 voted roughly the way Russia did: seven hundred and twenty-one ballots, or fifty-one per cent, for United Russia, the rest scattered among the Communists, the left-leaning Just Cause Party, and the nationalist L.D.P.R. United Russia’s national average was forty-nine per cent, which, while still a plurality and largely in line with national polls, was a far cry from the two-thirds of the vote they got in the last parliamentary elections, in 2007.  It was also far higher than what the party managed in many regions, including the Moscow region: thirty-three per cent.  And if you could somehow subtract the violations and antics and perfect ballot stacks I saw in Yasenevo, the numbers would doubtless be lower.\r\n\r\n What was notable, however, was the level of anger in the Yasenevo election commission — the sneering, the barking;  the scoffing, yelling, and smirking.  I left the precinct with shaking hands.  Julia Dobrokhotova, my friend and the mother of two small children, was forced to wait until two in the morning to file her report.  She told me she spent the next day crying.\r\n\r\n Dobrokhotova recounted her conversations with the commission after I left.  There was the tall young man from the municipal government who had seated Dobrokhotova behind a tall plant when the voting started that morning and hissed at her not to move.  (She later wondered if that was when ballot boxes had been stuffed.)  In the early morning hours, after the ballots had been counted and the yelling had died down, he gave Dobrokhotova a surprising appraisal of his country.  “He told me that Russia has only ever been good at two things: fighting off invaders and surviving famine,” Dobrokhotova recalled.  “Nothing else.”  The tubby police boss?  “He said to me, ‘Julia, why are you so upset?  This is a slave-owning society, and it’s like that in most countries in the world, except for two or three.  It’s not our fate to be one of them.’  ”  The man in the snowflake sweater told her that she should reconsider sending her children to the school, as he could make their lives miserable.  And the shrill women?  “They said, ‘Julia, what’s the alternative?  Man the barricades?’ ”\r\n\r\n The next night, Dobrokhotova’s brother, Roman, did just that.  The head of a tiny political youth movement, “We,” he was one of the organizers of a protest in central Moscow, which, to everyone’s surprise, drew some six thousand people — almost all of them young, educated, and angry.  They saw a different generation — that of the election commission in Yasenevo — lying to them and manipulating their elections and treating them like fools.  Something about this election, the cynicism and ham-fistedness with which it was carried out, the euphoria when, despite the apparent fraud, United Russia failed to get even fifty per cent, made the barricades an attractive option for a cohort that has long been written off as politically inactive.\r\n\r\n Opposition protests in Moscow rarely draw more than a couple hundred people, most of them elderly Soviet dissidents, their dreams dashed and irrelevant.  Monday night, a large, wooded square in central Moscow — Chistye Prudy — was too small to hold the young, energetic crowd.  They hung on fences;  they lined the streets and blocked traffic.  And when the riot police attacked, they weren’t scared: They were fed up.  Or, as a thirty-five-year-old voter at Yasenevo’s polling station #2390 told me after he cast his ballot for Just Russia, the first time he had been to the polls since the nineteen-nineties, “Maybe people once believed that you can’t do everything right away, that you need more time to develop democracy, to pass reforms.  But how much time do you need?  A hundred years?”\r\n\r\n Read more http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/12/russian-elections-faking-it.html#ixzz1fq78xtaF\r\n"

I love you very much, from the first day of our acquaintance.\r\n —§—\r\n My girl, I have for you is incredibly large and truly a wonderful feeling, without which a person is not living, but simply exists - it is love.  You're everything to me and even more, you're the one for which I began to live and breathe.\r\n I love you and will love you forever!\r\n —§—\r\n My favorite cat, I love you madly!  I will give everything for you.,  You are my whole world, you're my life, I am happy with you.  I appreciate our relationship and I value you, I want you and I were always together, not separate even for a moment, my sweetheart.  I love you!\r\n —§—\r\n My dear, the best girl on this earth.  I do not know what's going on in your mind, just want to say that for me acquainted with you - the best thing that happened to me lately, I am grateful to God for what I met you, can not imagine how I lived without knowing you.

You are the most beautiful in this world and I am very happy that we met with you!  You know that I love you, but I want to tell you about it personally - that I am madly in love and in his feelings, I have no doubt a drop, I really cherish you.  You are the most expensive man for me in this world!\r\n —§—\r\n I never thought that you can spend days thinking about the same person.  About the person with whom you are always good and comfortable with who never want to leave, to which the hours pass like minutes.  About a man looking in his eyes that you forget about everything!  Honey, I miss you so, I'm so bored!  I wish that we were always together.  I want to reiterate to you all my life - I love you, love, love \r\n —§—\r\n I remember when I was terribly nervous before our meeting.  I was expecting an interview with an ordinary girl, and I was waiting for an angel!  When you came to me and looked at me, took my breath, my heart sank, my knees buckled and chest somehow unnaturally felt warm.  I was drowned in sight of heaven's most beautiful eyes in the world.  During our brief meeting, I realized that it would not last.  Walking next to you and talking about all nonsense, I felt like my heart is filled with joy, and distributed throughout the body heat.  I was happy on the present.  I loved you from the first second of the meeting and will always love, my joy.\r\n —§—\r\n I have changed everything, since you came into my life!

You're forever in my heart.\r\n —§—\r\n I love you very carefully to keep your heart ... each view of your beautiful eyes, every word uttered that your angelic lips, every second that we were close.  You are totally and completely captivated him my heart and soul ... and my heart can not have without you ... I love you babe!\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"\"Gentlemen,\" he said, in closing his address of explanation at the meeting, quite as erect, secure, defiant, convincing as he had ever been, \"you see how things are.  These securities are worth just as much as they ever were.  There is nothing the matter with the properties behind them.  If you will give me fifteen days or twenty, I am satisfied that I can straighten the whole matter out.  I am almost the only one who can, for I know all about it.  The market is bound to recover.  Business is going to be better than ever.  It's time I want.  Time is the only significant factor in this situation.  I want to know if you won't give me fifteen or twenty days—a month, if you can.  That is all I want.\"\r\n\r\n He stepped aside and out of the general room, where the blinds were drawn, into his private office, in order to give his creditors an opportunity to confer privately in regard to his situation.  He had friends in the meeting who were for him.  He waited one, two, nearly three hours while they talked.  Finally Walter Leigh, Judge Kitchen, Avery Stone, of Jay Cooke & Co., and several others came in.  They were a committee appointed to gather further information.\r\n\r\n \"Nothing more can be done to-day, Frank,\" Walter Leigh informed him, quietly.  \"The majority want the privilege of examining the books.  There is some uncertainty about this entanglement with the city treasurer which you say exists.  They feel that you'd better announce a temporary suspension, anyhow;  and if they want to let you resume later they can do so.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'm sorry for that, gentlemen,\" replied Cowperwood, the least bit depressed.  \"I would rather do anything than suspend for one hour, if I could help it, for I know just what it means.  You will find assets here far exceeding the liabilities if you will take the stocks at their normal market value;  but that won't help any if I close my doors.  The public won't believe in me.  I ought to keep open.\"\r\n\r\n \"Sorry, Frank, old boy,\" observed Leigh, pressing his hand affectionately.  \"If it were left to me personally, you could have all the time you want.  There's a crowd of old fogies out there that won't listen to reason.  They're panic-struck.  I guess they're pretty hard hit themselves.  You can scarcely blame them.  You'll come out all right, though I wish you didn't have to shut up shop.  We can't do anything with them, however.  Why, damn it, man, I don't see how you can fail, really.  In ten days these stocks will be all right.\"\r\n\r\n Judge Kitchen commiserated with him also;  but what good did that do?  He was being compelled to suspend.  An expert accountant would have to come in and go over his books.  Butler might spread the news of this city-treasury connection.  Stener might complain of this last city-loan transaction.  A half-dozen of his helpful friends stayed with him until four o'clock in the morning;  but he had to suspend just the same.  And when he did that, he knew he was seriously crippled if not ultimately defeated in his race for wealth and fame.\r\n\r\n When he was really and finally quite alone in his private bedroom he stared at himself in the mirror.  His face was pale and tired, he thought, but strong and effective.  \"Pshaw!\"  he said to himself, \"I'm not whipped.  I'm still young.  I'll get out of this in some way yet.  Certainly I will.  I'll find some way out.\"\r\n\r\n And so, cogitating heavily, wearily, he began to undress.  Finally he sank upon his bed, and in a little while, strange as it may seem, with all the tangle of trouble around him, slept.  He could do that—sleep and gurgle most peacefully, the while his father paced the floor in his room, refusing to be comforted.  All was dark before the older man—the future hopeless.  Before the younger man was still hope.\r\n\r\n And in her room Lillian Cowperwood turned and tossed in the face of this new calamity.  For it had suddenly appeared from news from her father and Frank and Anna and her mother-in-law that Frank was about to fail, or would, or had—it was almost impossible to say just how it was.  Frank was too busy to explain.  The Chicago fire was to blame.  There was no mention as yet of the city treasurership.  Frank was caught in a trap, and was fighting for his life.\r\n\r\n In this crisis, for the moment, she forgot about the note as to his infidelity, or rather ignored it.  She was astonished, frightened, dumbfounded, confused.  Her little, placid, beautiful world was going around in a dizzy ring.  The charming, ornate ship of their fortune was being blown most ruthlessly here and there.  She felt it a sort of duty to stay in bed and try to sleep;  but her eyes were quite wide, and her brain hurt her.  Hours before Frank had insisted that she should not bother about him, that she could do nothing;  and she had left him, wondering more than ever what and where was the line of her duty.  To stick by her husband, convention told her;  and so she decided.  Yes, religion dictated that, also custom.  There were the children.  They must not be injured.  Frank must be reclaimed, if possible.  He would get over this.  But what a blow! \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXI\r\n\r\n The suspension of the banking house of Frank A. Cowperwood & Co. created a great stir on 'change and in Philadelphia generally.  It was so unexpected, and the amount involved was comparatively so large.  Actually he failed for one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars;  and his assets, under the depressed condition of stock values, barely totaled seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  There had been considerable work done on the matter of his balance-sheet before it was finally given to the public;  but when it was, stocks dropped an additional three points generally, and the papers the next day devoted notable headlines to it.  Cowperwood had no idea of failing permanently;  he merely wished to suspend temporarily, and later, if possible, to persuade his creditors to allow him to resume.  There were only two things which stood in the way of this: the matter of the five hundred thousand dollars borrowed from the city treasury at a ridiculously low rate of interest, which showed plainer than words what had been going on, and the other, the matter of the sixty-thousand-dollar check.  His financial wit had told him there were ways to assign his holdings in favor of his largest creditors, which would tend to help him later to resume;  and he had been swift to act.  Indeed, Harper Steger had drawn up documents which named Jay Cooke & Co., Edward Clark & Co., Drexel & Co., and others as preferred.  He knew that even though dissatisfied holders of smaller shares in his company brought suit and compelled readjustment or bankruptcy later, the intention shown to prefer some of his most influential aids was important.  They would like it, and might help him later when all this was over.  Besides, suits in plenty are an excellent way of tiding over a crisis of this kind until stocks and common sense are restored, and he was for many suits. "
