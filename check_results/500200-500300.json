        "text":" Four quick steps and Rambo chopped the flat edge of his hand across the bridge of the guy's nose and caught the gun dropping from the guy's hand as he fell.  Somebody from downstairs was pushing at the wreck of the scaffold.  Rambo fired twice, hearing Teasle cry out, hoping the shots would hold back Teasle long enough for him to reach the front door.\r\n\r\n He made it there, firing once again at the scaffold before he burst outside naked into the hot glare of the evening sun.  An old woman on the sidewalk screamed;  a man slowed his car and stared.  Rambo leapt down the front steps onto the sidewalk past the old woman screaming, toward a man in work clothes going by on a motorcycle.  The man made the mistake of slowing down to look, because by the time he decided to speed up, Rambo had got to him and lunged him off the cycle.  The man hit the street headfirst, his yellow crash helmet scraping across the pavement.  Rambo swung onto the cycle, his bare hips on the hot black seat, and the cycle roared off, with him firing his last three bullets at Teasle who had just rushed out the front door of the station and then ducked back in when he saw Rambo aiming.  Rambo raced the cycle down past the courthouse, weaving, zigzagging to throw off Teasle's aim.  Ahead people were standing on a corner, looking, and he hoped the risk of hitting them would keep Teasle from shooting.  He heard shouts behind him, shouts ahead of him from the people on the corner.  One man came running off the corner to stop him, but Rambo kicked him away and then he was whipping left around the corner, and for now he was safe and he really got the cycle going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 12\r\n\r\n\r\n Six bullets, Teasle counted.  The kid's gun was empty.  He charged outside squinting in the sun just in time to see the kid disappearing round the corner.  Shingleton had his gun aimed;  Teasle yanked it down.\r\n\r\n 'Christ, don't you see all those people?'\r\n\r\n 'I could've had him!'\r\n\r\n 'You could've had more than him!'  He ran back in the station, swinging open the front door, three bullet holes in the aluminum screen.  'Get in here!  Check Galt and Preston!  Phone a doctor!'  He was running across the room to the two-way radio, astonished that Shingleton had tried firing.  The guy was so efficient in the office, always second-guessing;  now, with no routine for this kind of trouble, he was stupidly acting on impulse.\r\n\r\n The screen door whacked shut as Shingleton rushed in and down the hall;  Teasle jabbed at a switch on the radio, talking fast into the microphone.  His hands were shaking;  his bowels felt full of loose hot waste.  'Ward!  Where the hell are you, Ward?'  he called into the radio, but Ward wasn't answering, and then at last Teasle had him, telling him what happened, figuring his tactics.  'He knows Center Road will take him out of town!  He's headed west in that direction!  Cut him off!'\r\n\r\n Shingleton came rushing around the hall corner into the front room, over to Teasle.  'Galt.  He's dead.  God, his guts are hanging out,' he blurted as he came.  He swallowed, trying to catch his breath.  'Preston's alive.  I don't know for how long.  He's got blood coming out his eyes.'\r\n\r\n 'Snap up!  Phone an ambulance!  A doctor!'  Teasle jabbed another switch on the radio.  His hands wouldn't stop shaking.  His bowels felt warmer, looser.  'State police,' he called quickly into the microphone.  'Madison to state police.  Emergency.'  They didn't answer.  He called louder.\r\n\r\n 'I'm not deaf, Madison,' a man's voice crackled.  'What's your trouble?'\r\n\r\n 'Jailbreak.  One officer dead,' he told him hurriedly, hating to waste time repeating what had happened.  Requesting roadblocks.  The voice was instantly alert.\r\n\r\n Shingleton put down the phone.  Teasle hadn't even heard him dial.  'The ambulance is on its way.'\r\n\r\n 'Phone me Orval Kellerman.'  Teasle jabbed another switch, calling another cruiser, ordering it after the kid.\r\n\r\n Shingleton had already dialed again.  Thank God he was all right now.  'Kellerman's outside.  I've got his wife.  She won't let me talk to him.'\r\n\r\n Teasle took the phone.  'Mrs.  Kellerman, it's Wilfred.  I need Orval in a hurry.'\r\n\r\n 'Wilfred?'  Her voice was thin and brittle.  'What a surprise, Wilfred.  We haven't heard from you in so long.'  Why didn't she speak faster?  'We were meaning to come around and tell you how sorry we were about Anna leaving.'\r\n\r\n He had to cut her off.  'Mrs.  Kellerman, I've got to speak to Orval.  It's important.'\r\n\r\n 'Dear, I'm awfully sorry.  He's outside working with the dogs and you know I can't disturb him when he's working with the dogs.'\r\n\r\n 'You've got to ask him to the phone.  Please.  Believe me it's important.'\r\n\r\n He heard her breathing.  'All right I'll ask him, but I can't promise he'll come in.  You know how he is when he's working the dogs.'\r\n\r\n He heard her set the phone down, and quickly he lit a cigarette.  Fifteen years he had been a policeman and he had never lost a prisoner and he had never had a partner killed.  He wanted to smash the kid's face against cement.\r\n\r\n 'What did he have to do it for?'  he said to Shingleton.  'It's fucking crazy.  He comes around looking for trouble, and in one afternoon he goes from vagrancy to murder.  Hey, are you all right?  Sit down and put your head between your knees.'\r\n\r\n 'I've never seen a man slashed before.  Galt.  I had lunch with him for crissake.'\r\n\r\n 'Doesn't matter how many times you see it.  I must have watched fifty guys bayonetted in Korea, and I never kept from feeling sick.  One man I knew in Louisville, twenty years on the force.  He went to check out a knifing in a bar one night, and there was so much blood mixed in with the beer on the floor he had a heart attack and died trying to make it back to the cruiser.'\r\n\r\n He heard somebody picking up the phone on the other end.  Please let it be Orval.\r\n\r\n 'So what is it, Will?  This better be as important as you say.'\r\n\r\n It was him.  Orval had been his father's best friend, and the three of them used to go out hunting together every Saturday of the season.  Then, after Teasle's father had been killed, Orval had become a second father to him.  He was retired now, but he was in better shape than men half as young, and he had the best trained pack of hounds in the county.\r\n\r\n 'Orval, we just had a jailbreak here.  I don't have time to explain, but it's a kid we're after, and he's killed one of my men, and I don't think he'll stay on the roads with the state police after him.  I'm positive he'll head for the mountains, and I'm hoping like hell that you're in the mood to give those dogs of yours the run of their lives.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 13\r\n\r\n\r\n Rambo roared the bike down Center Road.  Wind was stinging his face and chest, his eyes were watering in the wind, and he was afraid he would have to slow to see what was ahead.  Cars were stopping abruptly, drivers staring out their windows at him naked on the cycle.  People all along the street were turning at him, pointing.  A siren started far behind him.  He revved the cycle up to sixty, racing through a red light, barely able to swerve in time to miss a big oil truck lumbering across the intersection.  Another siren started far to his left.  There was no way a cycle could outrun police cars.  But a cycle could go where police cars couldn't: the mountains.\r\n\r\n The street dipped sharply and then rose long uphill, and Rambo sped up it, hearing the sirens.  The one on his left had swung over to join the one behind him.  He hit the top of the hill so fast that the cycle left the pavement, jolting back down, forcing him to slow and catch his balance.  Then he was racing again.\r\n\r\n He passed the YOU ARE NOW LEAVING MADISON sign, passed the ditch where he had eaten his hamburgers that afternoon.  The fields of brown corn swept off on both sides, and the sirens were closer, and the mountains were off to the right.  He swerved that way onto a dirt road, almost spilling when he turned sharply to miss a dairy truck.  The driver leaned out his window, shouting at him.\r\n\r\n Now he was throwing up dust behind him, holding his speed at fifty to keep from skidding on the loose gravel.  The sirens were behind him to the right, then directly behind him.  They were coming too fast.  If he stayed on this dirt road, he would never lose them in time to get to the mountains;  he had to leave this road for someplace they could not go.  He dodged to the left through an open gate down a narrow wagon road, its ruts deep and yellow in the ground.  The corn remained on both sides, the mountains were still off to the right, and he was searching for a way to get over to them.  The sirens louder, he reached the end of the cornfields, turning right onto a field of wilted grass, the cycle heaving on the uneven ground, dipping and rising, whipping through the grass.  But the police cars would still be able to chase him this way, and then he heard their sirens louder, yet, directly behind him again.\r\n\r\n A stout wooden fence ahead.  He sped closer, frantic from the sirens, seeing cattle.  What must have been a hundred.  They were in this field, but they were moving out ahead of him, ambling through an open gate in the fence and up a slope toward trees.  The roar of his cycle started them galloping before he got to them, Jersey brown, bellowing, heaving three abreast through the open gate and up the slope, their milk sacks swinging full.  They loomed larger the closer he came behind them, scattering, hooves thundering as he pushed through the gate with the last of them and raced up the slope.  It was steep, and he had to lean forward to keep the front wheel from tipping up.  Past one tree, then another, the mountains close, and then he was off the slope, speeding onto level ground.  He leapt the bike over a narrow stream, almost upsetting on the other bank.  But the mountains were wonderfully close now, and he steadied the bike and revved the throttle to its limit.  Ahead a line of trees, then thick forest, rocks, underbrush.  At last he saw what he was looking for  —  a draw between two slopes up into the rocky hills  —  and he steered that way as the sirens began dying close behind him.\r\n\r\n That meant the cruisers had stopped.  The police would be jumping out now, aiming at him.  He concentrated on the draw.  A crack of a gun, bullet zipping past his head, whunking into a tree.  He bore fast into scattered trees, zigzagging toward the draw.  Another crack of a gun, but the bullet nowhere close, and then he was into thick forest, out of sight up into the draw.  Thirty feet ahead a tangle of rocks and upturned trees blocked his path, and he slid off the cycle, letting it roll crashing into the rocks.  He scrambled up the dense slope, sharp branches digging everywhere into him.  There would be more police after him.  A lot more.  Soon.  At least he would have a little time to climb high into the mountains before they came.  He would head for Mexico.  He would hole up in Mexico in a little coast town and swim every day in the sea.  But he had better not ever see that sonofabitch Teasle again.  He had promised himself that he was through hurting people, and now that sonofabitch had made him kill once more, and if Teasle kept pushing, Rambo was determined to give back a fight Teasle would wish to God he had never started."

        "text":" And that was a joke too.  Because what on earth did he have in his stomach to heave up?  Nothing.  That's right, nothing.  So what was this stuff on the ground in front of him?  Raspberry pie, he joked.  And that made him sick again.\r\n\r\n So he crawled through it over a couple of furrows and collapsed, and then he crawled over a few more.  There was a pool of black water between two furrows.  He had been twisting his face toward the sky all night to drink the rain, but his tongue was still choking him, his throat was still swollen dry, and he drank from the muddy water, poking his face down close and lapping and almost passing out with his face in the water.  There was sweet gritty dirt in his mouth.  A few more feet.  Just try to do a few more feet.  I get away, I'll kill that bastard kid… tear him.\r\n\r\n Because I'm a, but then the idea fell apart on him.\r\n\r\n I'm a, but he couldn't remember, and then he had to stop and rest, chin on the top of a mulchy furrow, the sun warming his back.  Can't stop.  Pass out.  Die.  Move.\r\n\r\n But he couldn't move.\r\n\r\n He couldn't raise himself to crawl on his hands and knees.  He tried clawing at the dirt ahead of him to pull himself forward, but he couldn't force himself to move that way either.  Got to.  Can't pass out.  Die.  He braced his shoes against a furrow and pushed and pushed harder and this time he budged a little.  His heart swelling, he pushed his shoes against the furrow even harder and inched forward through the mud, and he didn't dare let himself stop: he knew he would never be able to raise the strength to go again.  Shoes against furrow.  Push.  Worm.  The kid.  That's it.  He remembered now.  He was going to fix the kid.\r\n\r\n I'm not as good a fighter.\r\n\r\n Oh yes, the kid's a better fighter.\r\n\r\n Oh yes, but I'm, and then the idea fell apart again as he lapsed into the mechanical rhythm of shoes against furrow  —  push  —  one more time  —  and push  —  one more time.  He didn't know when his arms had started back to work, hands clawing the dirt, dragging him along.  Organize.  That was the word he'd been searching for.  And then he clawed forward and he touched something.\r\n\r\n It took a while to register.\r\n\r\n A wire.\r\n\r\n He looked up, and there were other wires.  A fence.  And sweet God, through the fence was something so beautiful that he didn't believe he was really seeing it.  A ditch.  A gravel road.  His heart was pounding wildly and he was laughing, sticking his head through the wires, shimmying through, the fence barbed wire, ripping his back some more, but he didn't care, he was laughing, rolling into the ditch.  It was full of water and he tumbled on his back, the water trickling into his ears, and then he was struggling up the rise toward the road, sliding down, groping up, sliding, flopping himself over the top, one arm touching the gravel of the road.  He could not feel the gravel.  He could see it sure.  He was squinting directly at it.  But he could not feel.\r\n\r\n Organize.  That was it.  Now he remembered it all.\r\n\r\n I know how to organize.\r\n\r\n The kid's a better fighter.  But I know how… to organize.\r\n\r\n For Orval.\r\n\r\n For Shingleton and Ward and Mitch and Lester and the young deputy and all of them.\r\n\r\n For me.\r\n\r\n I'll cream that fucking bastard.\r\n He lay there at the side of the road, repeating that over and over to himself, closing his eyes to the glare of the sun, snickering at how his pants were in shreds, at how bloody he was, the blood seeping through the mud on him while he grinned, repeating his idea, telling it to the state trooper who said 'My God' and gave up trying to lift him into the cruiser and ran for the car radio."
