        "text":"'Er, sorry,' said Richard, abruptly, 'but, er, have you seen or heard a horse coming up this staircase tonight?'\r\n The man stopped his obsessive twitching of his fingers.  He cocked his head slightly on one side and then seemed to need to go on a long journey inside himself to find a voice, which when found turned out to be a thin and soft little one.\r\n He said, 'That is the first thing anybody has said to me for seventeen years, three months and two days, five hours, nineteen minutes and twenty seconds.  I've been counting.'\r\n He closed the door softly again.\r\n Richard virtually ran through Second Court.\r\n When he reached First Court he steadied himself and slowed down to a walking pace.\r\n The chill night air was rasping in his lungs and there was no point in running.  He hadn't managed to talk to Susan because Reg's phone wasn't working, and this was another thing that he had been mysteriously coy about.  That at least was susceptible of a rational explanation.  He probably hadn't paid his phone bill.\r\n Richard was about to emerge out on to the street when instead he decided to pay a quick visit to the porter's lodge, which was tucked away inside the great archway entrance into the college.  It was a small hutchlike place filled with keys, messages and a single electric bar heater.  A radio nattered to itself in the background.\r\n 'Excuse me,' he said to the large black-suited man standing behind the counter with his arms folded.  'I…'\r\n 'Yes, Mr MacDuff, what can I do for you?'\r\n In his present state of mind Richard would have been hard-pressed himself to remember his own name and was startled for a moment.\r\n However, college porters are legendary for their ability to perform such feats of memory, and for their tendency to show them off at the slightest provocation.\r\n 'Is there,' said Richard, 'a horse anywhere in the college - that you know of?  I mean, you would know if there was a horse in the college, wouldn't you?'\r\n The porter didn't blink.\r\n 'No, sir, and yes, sir.  Anything else I can help you with, Mr MacDuff, sir?'\r\n 'Er, no,' said Richard and tapped his fingers a couple of times on the counter.  'No.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for your help.  Nice to see you again, er… Bob,' he hazarded.  'Good-night, then.'\r\n He left.\r\n The porter remained perfectly still with his arms folded, but shaking his head a very, very little bit.\r\n 'Here's some coffee for you, Bill,' said another porter, a short wiry one, emerging from an inner sanctum with a steaming cup.  'Getting a bit colder tonight?'\r\n 'I think it is, Fred, thanks,' said Bill, taking the cup.\r\n He took a sip.  'You can say what you like about people, they don't get any less peculiar.  Fellow in here just now asking if there was a horse in the college.'\r\n 'Oh yes?'  Fred sipped at his own coffee, and let the steam smart his eyes.  ' I had a chap in here earlier.  Sort of strange foreign priest.\r\n Couldn't understand a word he said at first.  But he seemed happy just to stand by the fire and listen to the news on the radio.'\r\n 'Foreigners, eh.'\r\n 'In the end I told him to shoot off.  Standing in front of my fire like that.  Suddenly he says is that really what he must do?  Shoot off?\r\n I said, in my best Bogart voice, \"You better believe it, buddy.\"'\r\n 'Really?  Sounded more like Jimmy Cagney to me.'\r\n 'No, that's my Bogart voice.  This is my Jimmy Cagney voice - \"You better believe it, buddy.\"'\r\n Bill frowned at him.  'Is that your Jimmy Cagney voice?  I always thought that was your Kenneth McKellar voice.'\r\n 'You don't listen properly, Bill, you haven't got the ear.  This is Kenneth McKellar.  \"Oh, you take the high road and I'll take the low road…\"'\r\n 'Oh, I see.  I was thinking of the Scottish Kenneth McKellar.  So what did this priest fellow say then, Fred?'\r\n 'Oh, he just looked me straight in the eyes, Bill, and said in this strange sort of…'\r\n 'Skip the accent, Fred, just tell me what he said, if it's worth hearing.'\r\n 'He just said he did believe me.'\r\n 'So.  Not a very interesting story then, Fred.'\r\n 'Well, maybe not.  I only mention it because he also said that he'd left his horse in a washroom and would I see that it was all right.'\r\n CHAPTER 11\r\n Gordon Way drifted miserably along the dark road, or rather, tried to drift.\r\n He felt that as a ghost - which is what he had to admit to himself he had become - he should be able to drift.  He knew little enough about ghosts, but he felt that if you were going to be one then there ought to be certain compensations for not having a physical body to lug around, and that among them ought to be the ability simply to drift.\r\n But no, it seemed he was going to have to walk every step of the way.\r\n His aim was to try and make it to his house.  He didn't know what he would do when he got there, but even ghosts have to spend the night somewhere, and he felt that being in familiar surroundings might help.\r\n Help what, he didn't know.  At least the journey gave him an objective, and he would just have to think of another one when he arrived.\r\n He trudged despondently from lamppost to lamppost, stopping at each one to look at bits of himself.\r\n He was definitely getting a bit wraithlike.\r\n At times he would fade almost to nothing, and would seem to be little more than a shadow playing in the mist, a dream of himself that could just evaporate and be gone.  At other times he seemed to be almost solid and real again.  Once or twice he would try leaning against a lamppost, and would fall straight through it if he wasn't careful.\r\n At last, and with great reluctance, he actually began to turn his mind to what it was that had happened.  Odd, that reluctance.  He really didn't want to think about it.  Psychologists say that the mind will often try to suppress the memory of traumatic events, and this, he thought, was probably the answer.  After all, if having a strange figure jump out of the boot of your own car and shoot you dead didn't count as a traumatic experience, he'd like to know what did.\r\n He trudged on wearily.\r\n He tried to recall the figure to his mind's eye, but it was like probing a hurting tooth, and he thought of other things.\r\n Like, was his will up-to-date?  He couldn't remember, and made a mental note to call his lawyer tomorrow, and then made another mental note that he would have to stop making mental notes like that.\r\n How would his company survive without him?  He didn't like either of the possible answers to that very much.\r\n What about his obituary?  There was a thought that chilled him to his bones, wherever they'd got to.  Would he be able to get hold of a copy?\r\n What would it say?  They'd better give him a good write-up, the bastards.  Look at what he'd done.  Single-handedly saved the British software industry: huge exports, charitable contributions, research scholarships, crossing the Atlantic in a solar-powered submarine (failed, but a good try) - all sorts of things.  They'd better not go digging up that Pentagon stuff again or he'd get his lawyer on to them.\r\n He made a mental note to call him in the mor…\r\n No.\r\n Anyway, can a dead person sue for libel? "

No one was injured, and the fire was quickly extinguished.\r\n US Airways Flight 431 was arriving from Charlotte, with 113 passengers and five crewmembers when it blew two tires on the runway shortly before noon, airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said.  A small fire ignited in one of the blown-out tires, Durrant said.\r\n The passengers and crew escaped using inflatable slides from the plane's exits, then waited in a grassy area near the runway.  Helicopter footage showed the flames extinguished and the plane surrounded by white foam.\r\n Passenger Jenna Kettenburg, 25, of Trenton, N.J., said that the landing was normal at first but suddenly became rough.  'It was real jagged and shaky,’ she said.  The plane's oxygen masks came down and the passengers were told to evacuate on the slides.\r\n Patrice White, 23, of Baltimore, said, ‘We didn't think it was that big of a deal, until we got off and saw the fire’.\r\n According to the Federal Aviation Administration records, the Boeing 737 jet was built in 1989."

        "text":"“Your wife mentioned a company called Dunn Lane, Ltd.  We’ve reviewed the files you’ve already given us.  Pretty good material.  What else do you know about it?”\r\n\r\n “A lot.  Chartered in 1986 with ten million, which was transferred into the corporation from a numbered account in Banco de Mexico, the same ten million that arrived in Grand Cayman in cash on a certain Lear jet registered to a quiet little law firm in Memphis, except that it was originally fourteen million but after payoffs to Cayman customs and Cayman bankers it was reduced to ten million.  When the company was chartered, the registered agent was a guy named Diego Sanchez, who happens to be a VP with Banco de Mexico.  The president was a delightful soul named Nathan Locke, the secretary was our old pal Royce McKnight and the treasurer of this cozy little corporation was a guy named Al Rubinstein.  I’m sure you know him.  I don’t.”\r\n\r\n “He’s a Morolto operative.”\r\n\r\n “Surprise, surprise.  Want more?”\r\n\r\n “Keep talking.”\r\n\r\n “After the seed money of ten million was invested into this venture, another ninety million in cash was deposited over the next three years.  Very profitable enterprise.  The company began buying all sorts of things in the U.S.-cotton farms in Texas, apartment complexes in Dayton, jewelry stores in Beverly Hills, hotels in St. Petersburg and Tampa.  Most of the transactions were by wire transfer from four or five different banks in the Caymans.  It’s a basic money-laundering operation.”\r\n\r\n “And you’ve got all this documented?”\r\n\r\n “Stupid question, Wayne.  If I didn’t have the documents, how would I know about it?  I only work on clean files, remember?”\r\n\r\n “How much longer will it take you?”\r\n\r\n “Couple of weeks.  Me and my employee are still snooping around Front Street.  And it doesn’t look good.  It’ll be very difficult to get files out of there.”\r\n\r\n “Where’d the ten thousand documents come from?”\r\n\r\n Mitch ignored the question.  He jumped to his feet and started for the door.  “Abby and I want to live in Albuquerque.  It’s a big town, sort of out of the way.  Start working on it.”\r\n\r\n “Don’t jump the gun.  There’s a lot of work to do.”\r\n\r\n “I said two weeks, Tarrance.  I’ll be ready to deliver in two weeks, and that means I’ll have to disappear.”\r\n\r\n “Not so fast.  I need to see a few of these documents.”\r\n\r\n “You have a short memory, Tarrance.  My lovely wife promised a big stack of Dunn Lane documents just as soon as Ray goes over the wall.”\r\n\r\n Tarrance looked across the dark field.  “I’ll see what I can do.”\r\n\r\n Mitch walked to him and pointed a finger in his face.  “Listen to me, Tarrance, and listen closely.  I don’t think we’re getting through.  Today is April 17.  Two weeks from today is May 1, and on May 1 I will deliver to you, as promised, over ten thousand very incriminating and highly admissible documents that will seriously cripple one of the largest organized crime families in the world.  And, eventually, it will cost me my life.  But I promised to do it.  And you’ve promised to get my brother out of prison.  You have a week, until April 24.  If not, I’ll disappear.  And so will your case, and career.”\r\n\r\n “What’s he gonna do when he gets out?”\r\n\r\n “You and your stupid questions.  He’ll run like hell, that’s what he’ll do.  He’s got a brother with a million dollars who’s an expert in money laundering and electronic banking.  He’ll be out of the country within twelve hours, and he’ll go find the million buck’s.”\r\n\r\n “The Bahamas.”\r\n\r\n “Bahamas.  You’re an idiot, Tarrance.  That money spent less than ten minutes in the Bahamas.  You can’t trust those corrupt fools down there.”\r\n\r\n “Mr.  Voyles doesn’t like deadlines.  He gets real upset.”\r\n\r\n “Tell Mr. Voyles to kiss my ass.  Tell him to get the next half million, because I’m almost ready.  Tell him to get my brother out or the deal’s off.  Tell him whatever you want, Tarrance, but Ray goes over the wall in a week or I’m gone.”\r\n\r\n Mitch slammed the door and started down the bleachers.  Tarrance followed.  “When do we talk again?”  he yelled.\r\n\r\n Mitch jumped the fence and was on the track.  “My employee will call you.  Just do as she says.”\r\n\r\n Chapter 31\r\n\r\n Nathan Locke’s annual three-day post-April 15 vacation in Vail had been canceled.  By DeVasher, on orders from Lazarov.  Locke and Oliver Lambert sat in the office on the fifth floor and listened.  DeVasher was reporting the bits and pieces and trying unsuccessfully to put the puzzle together.\r\n\r\n “His wife leaves.  Says she’s gotta go home to her mother, who’s got lung cancer.  And that she’s tired of a bunch of his crap.  We’ve detected a little trouble here and there over the months.  She bitched a little about his hours and all, but nothing this serious.  So she goes home to Mommy.  Says she don’t know when she’s coming back.  Mommy’s sick, right?  Removed a lung, right?  But we can’t find a hospital that’s heard of Maxine Sutherland.  We’ve checked every hospital in Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee.  Seems odd, doesn’t it, fellas?”\r\n\r\n “Come on, DeVasher,” Lambert said.  “My wife had surgery four years ago, and we flew to the Mayo Clinic.  I know of no law requiring one to have surgery within a hundred miles of home.  That’s absurd.  And these are society people.  Maybe she checked in under another name to keep it quiet.  Happens all the time.”\r\n\r\n Locke nodded and agreed.  “How much has he talked to her?”\r\n\r\n “She calls about once a day.  They’ve had some good talks, about this and that.  The dog.  Her mom.  The office.  She told him last night she ain’t coming back for at least two months.”\r\n\r\n “Has she ever indicated which hospital?”  asked Locke.\r\n\r\n “Never.  She’s been real careful.  Doesn’t talk much about the surgery.  Mommy is supposedly home now.  If she ever left.”\r\n\r\n “What’re you getting at, DeVasher?”  asked Lambert.\r\n\r\n “Shut up and I’ll finish.  Just suppose it’s all a ruse to get her outta town.  To get her away from us.  From what’s coming down.  Follow?”\r\n\r\n “You’re assuming he’s working with them?”  asked Locke.\r\n\r\n “I get paid for making those assumptions, Nat.  I’m assuming he knows the phones are bugged, and that’s why they’re so careful on the phone.  I’m assuming he got her outta town to protect her.”\r\n\r\n “Pretty shaky,” said Lambert.  “Pretty shaky.”\r\n\r\n DeVasher paced behind his desk.  He glared at Ollie and let it pass.  “About ten days ago, somebody makes a bunch of unusual copies on the fourth floor.  Strange because it was three in the morning.  According to our records, when the copies were made only two lawyers were here.  McDeere and Scott Kimble.  Neither of whom had any business on the fourth floor.  Twenty-four access numbers were used.  Three belong to Lamar Quin’s files.  Three belong to Sonny Capps.  The other eighteen belong to McDeere’s files. "

The APU was running, engine #1 had been started and was running, engine #4 was spooling up for startup when the crew heard a muffled bang.  The first officer monitoring the APU had observed fluctuations of the rpms and a temperature rise of the APU, engines #1 and #4 were stopped, the APU was stopped and the fire extinguisher discharged.  The captain instructed a flight mechanics to leave the aircraft through the emergency exit at the floor of the cockpit to check the exterior of the aircraft;  the engineer reported subsequently that the APU was on fire.  A second flight mechanics and the flight engineer left the cockpit and joined efforts to extinguish the fire, at 02:07L the radio operator advised tower of a fire on board and requested emergency services.  At 02:08L observers around the aircraft noticed the fire, too, and observed a fluid leaking from the aircraft.

        "text":"US President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.\r\n\r\n The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey \"has been terminated and removed from office\".\r\n\r\n But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\r\n\r\n The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information to Congress last week about Mrs Clinton emails.\r\n\r\n Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.\r\n\r\n The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.\r\n\r\n The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately.  It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.\r\n\r\n Is Comey's firing part of a cover-up?\r\n\r\n Why does the administration say Comey was fired?\r\n\r\n President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that \"you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau\".\r\n\r\n Mr Sessions said the department of justice was \"committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law\", and \"a fresh start is needed\".\r\n\r\n Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation \r\n Into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server for sensitive government business, given that Mr Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.\r\n\r\n In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it \"took guts\" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry.  \"What he did brought back his reputation,\" Mr Trump said.\r\n\r\n 'He wouldn't say he was wrong'\r\n Does it pay to be brave?\r\n News 'sends chill' through FBI\r\n\r\n But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he \"cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [of State Hillary] Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken\".\r\n\r\n \"Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes;  it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.\"\r\n\r\n Mr Rosenstein also said:\r\n\r\n  Mr Comey had been wrong to \"usurp\" the previous attorney general in July 2016 when he announced the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution\r\n That he had compounded his error by \"gratuitously\" releasing \"derogatory information\" about Mrs Clinton\r\n\r\n What about the Russia investigation?\r\n\r\n Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin.\r\n\r\n The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are looking into the same allegations.\r\n\r\n \"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?\"  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference.\r\n\r\n \"This does not seem to be a coincidence,\" he added.\r\n\r\n Mr Trump responded on Twitter that Mr Schumer had recently expressed his lack of confidence in the FBI chief.\r\n\r\n President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are \"fake news\".\r\n\r\n Reaction to sacking\r\n Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake\r\n\r\n What are Republicans saying?\r\n\r\n \"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.\"  - Richard Burr, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee\r\n \"My staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.\"  - Justin Amash, a conservative Michigan congressman, adding that a line in Mr Trump's letter, that Mr Comey had informed him three times he was not under investigation, was \"just bizarre\"\r\n Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, a longstanding Trump critic, said the \"timing of the firing is very troubling\"\r\n\r\n A cover-up?  Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington\r\n\r\n Donald Trump and senior justice department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server.  They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support.\r\n\r\n Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House.  They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\r\n\r\n At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree.\r\n\r\n Read Anthony's analysis\r\n How did Comey handle the email inquiry?\r\n\r\n Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security.\r\n\r\n The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation.\r\n\r\n He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails.\r\n\r\n What was Clinton FBI probe about?\r\n\r\n He told the Senate last week it had made him \"mildly nauseous\" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again.  Mrs Clinton lays part of the blame for her shock election defeat last November on Mr Comey.\r\n\r\n He told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded \"hundreds and thousands\" of emails, \"some of which contain classified information\", to her husband.\r\n\r\n But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had sent only two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing.\r\n Watergate 2.0?\r\n\r\n In June 1972, five men were arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) at the Watergate office and hotel complex in Washington.  The break-in was traced to President Richard Nixon's supporters.\r\n\r\n The firing of James Comey is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when Mr Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the break-in and the subsequent cover-up.\r\n\r\n \"Not since Watergate has a president dismissed the person leading an investigation bearing on him,\" the New York Times wrote late on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n Mr Nixon later admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry.  He later became the only US president to resign."

        "text":"The investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email arrangements is once again in the spotlight.  So what was it all about?\r\n\r\n FBI boss James Comey has been fired because he mishandled the Clinton investigation, says the White House.\r\n\r\n It's a saga that has dogged the former secretary of state and one which many of her supporters say was responsible for her election defeat.\r\n\r\n This is what we know about it.\r\n What was the initial scandal about?\r\n\r\n Before becoming secretary of state in 2009, Mrs Clinton set up an email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office.\r\n\r\n She did not use, or even activate, a state.gov  email account, which would have been hosted on servers owned and managed by the US government.\r\n\r\n She said it was for convenience.\r\n\r\n \"I thought using one device would be simpler, and obviously, it hasn't worked out that way,\" she said.\r\n\r\n But critics said it gave her control over what information entered the public domain.\r\n\r\n What is the email scandal all about?\r\n Was it against the law?\r\n\r\n Probably not.  Mrs Clinton's email system existed in a grey area of the law - and one that has been changed several times since she left office.\r\n\r\n When she became secretary of state, the controlling interpretation of the 1950 Federal Records Act was that officials using personal email accounts must ensure that official correspondence is turned over to the government.  Ten months after she took office, a new regulation allowed the use of private emails only if federal records were \"preserved in the appropriate agency recordkeeping system\".\r\n\r\n Mrs Clinton maintains that this requirement was satisfied because most of her emails from her personal account went to, or were forwarded to, people with government accounts, so they were automatically archived.  Any other emails were turned over to State Department officials when they issued a request to her - and several of her predecessors - in October 2014.\r\n\r\n A State Department investigation said her arrangement violated government policy, and FBI boss James Comey said in July 2016 that it was careless but not criminal.\r\n So why wasn't that the end of it?\r\n\r\n In a bombshell announcement on 28 October, the FBI said it had found new emails that \"appeared to be pertinent\" to its investigation.\r\n\r\n The emails, including some from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were found on a laptop belonging to her estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner.\r\n\r\n The revelation angered the Clinton campaign, and Mr Comey came under fire from some Democrats for allegedly interfering in the election.Donald Trump, meanwhile, seized on the news to accuse Mrs Clinton of grand corruption.\r\n\r\n And he praised Mr Comey, saying it \"took guts\" for him to make the intervention.\r\n\r\n But in the final days of a heated election campaign, Mr Comey said that after reviewing the newly discovered emails, the FBI had not changed its position that Mrs Clinton's should not face criminal charges.\r\n\r\n Mr Trump changed his tune, saying Mrs Clinton was \"being protected by a rigged system\".\r\n Did Comey's late intervention swing the election?\r\n\r\n Mrs Clinton thinks so, citing it as a major factor in her surprise defeat.\r\n\r\n Political analyst Nate Silver agrees, saying it \"probably\" cost the former first lady a return to the White House as president.\r\n\r\n This is what BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher said at the time:\r\n\r\nWhen determining the political fallout of this latest development, it's worth remembering that the race between Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton was already tightening in the days leading up to the first Comey letter.\r\n\r\n Surveys taken after the revelation indicated that few Americans considered the story grounds for changing their vote.  The divide between the two candidates is simply too great to allow much ticket-switching at this point.\r\n\r\n What the story did do was knock Mr Trump out of the headlines for over a week, giving him space to bring disaffected Republicans back into the fold.  It also prevented Mrs Clinton from ending the campaign on a positive message and increased negative perceptions of her, which will make it harder for her to govern if she is elected.\r\n Once this election is in the rear-view mirror, there will have to be a lot of soul-searching within the FBI and the media about how this story has played out and been covered.  Following Mr Comey's original letter, the nation's top law-enforcement became a constant source of leaks, as internal factions and disputes spilled into public view.\r\n\r\n How FBI email verdict affects election\r\n And what's happened since the election?\r\n\r\n The investigation remains closed but the debate about Mr Comey's actions rage on.\r\n\r\n The anger felt by Clinton supporters were compounded when it emerged that the FBI had been looking into any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mr Comey chose not to go public with it.\r\n\r\n In May, he gave evidence to a Senate Judiciary Committee and defended himself.\r\n\r\n He said that it was a \"painful\" dilemma when he decided to make his October pronouncement, but if he had not come forward about the new Clinton emails, he would have been guilty of concealment.\r\n\r\n Mr Comey said he felt \"nauseous\" at the thought he might have had an impact.\r\n\r\n Deconstructing Comey's testimony"

        "text":"FBI Director James Comey has revisited his fateful decision to write a letter informing Congress that he was reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server less than two weeks before November's presidential election.\r\n\r\n According to political analyst Nate Silver, the Comey letter \"probably\" cost the former secretary of state the presidential election - a view recently endorsed by Mrs Clinton herself.\r\n\r\n Mr Comey's Wednesday remarks were in response to a question from California Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein during a Judiciary Committee hearing, and it was one for which the director was clearly prepared.  His seven-minute answer was measured yet forceful;  polished yet seemingly sincere.\r\n\r\n Here's a closer look at what he said - and what it may mean.\r\n \"October 27, the investigative team that had finished the investigation in July ... laid out for me what they could see from the metadata on this fellow, Anthony Weiner's, laptop... What they could see from the metadata was that there were thousands of Secretary Clinton's emails on that device, including what they thought might be the missing emails from her first three months as secretary of state.\"\r\n\r\n Mr Comey first sets out why he thought the emails on the laptop of Mr Weiner, husband of Clinton adviser Huma Abedin, could be so important.  There was the possibility that these never-before-seen Clinton messages could be a potential smoking gun - \"evidence that she was acting with bad intent,\" in Mr Comey's words.\r\n\r\n If Mrs Clinton, or her aides, had set up her private email server not because of convenience, as they asserted, but to avoid open-records requirements or intentionally break the law, then Mr Comey could have cause to bring a criminal case against the former secretary of state.\r\n \"I've lived my entire career by the tradition that if you can possible avoid it, you avoid any action in the run-up to an election that might have an impact, whether it's a dog-catcher election or president of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n Mr Comey is echoing an unwritten rule in the US Justice Department, of which the FBI is a part, that investigators should avoid taking actions that could affect the outcome of an election that is less than 60 days away.\r\n\r\n A memo first distributed by the Justice Department in the George W Bush administration and subsequently recirculated by Obama Attorney General Eric Holder instructs government employees to \"never select the timing of investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party\".\r\n\r\n Following Mr Comey's letter to Congress, members of the Clinton team, including campaign manager Robbie Mook, suggested Mr Comey was violating this rule.\r\n \"I sat there that morning, and I could not see a door labelled no action here.  I could see two doors, and they were both actions.  One was labelled speak.  The other was labelled conceal.\"\r\n\r\n Here is the heart of what Mr Comey describes as his \"painful\" dilemma.  Once he decided to reopen the investigation, he believed that doing nothing would effectively be active concealment.\r\n\r\n In the ensuing days and months, Mr Comey's critics have said silence would not only have been in keeping with Justice Department policy, it would have been the prudent move given that the director did not know what the Weiner laptop contained. \r\n"

He knew with a sense of creeping dread that of all the things he had left behind in the land of the living it was the telephone that he was going to miss the most, and then he turned his mind determinedly back to where it didn't want to go.\r\n The figure.\r\n It seemed to him that the figure had been almost like a figure of Death itself;  or was that his imagination playing tricks with him?  Was he dreaming that it was a cowled figure?  What would any figure, whether cowled or just casually dressed, be doing in the boot of his car?\r\n At that moment a car zipped past him on the road and disappeared off into the night, taking its oasis of light with it.  He thought with longing of the warm, leather-upholstered, climate-controlled comfort of his own car abandoned on the road behind him, and then a sudden extraordinary thought struck him.\r\n Was there any way he could hitch a lift?  Could anyone actually see him?  How would anyone react if they could?  Well, there was only one way to find out.\r\n He heard another car coming up in the distance behind him and turned to face it.  The twin pools of hazy lights approached through the mist and Gordon gritted his phantom teeth and stuck his thumb out at them.\r\n The car swept by regardless.\r\n Nothing.\r\n Angrily he made an indistinct V sign at the receding red rear lights, and realised, looking straight through his own upraised arm, that he wasn't at his most visible at the moment.  Was there perhaps some effort of will he could make to render himself more visible when he wanted to?  He screwed up his eyes in concentration, then realised that he would need to have his eyes open in order to judge the results.\r\n He tried again, forcing his mind as hard as he could, but the results were unsatisfactory.\r\n Though it did seem to make some kind of rudimentary, glowing difference, he couldn't sustain it, and it faded almost immediately, however much he piled on the mental pressure.  He would have to judge the timing very carefully if he was going to make his presence felt, or at least seen.\r\n Another car approached from behind, travelling fast.  He turned again, stuck his thumb out, waited till the moment was right and willed himself visible.\r\n The car swerved slightly, and then carried on its way, only a little more slowly.  Well, that was something.  What else could he do?  He would go and stand under a lamppost for a start, and he would practise.  The next car he would get for sure.\r\n CHAPTER 12\r\n '…so if you'd like to leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as possible.  Maybe.'  /Beep. / \r\n 'Shit.  Damn.  Hold on a minute.  Blast.  Look… er…' /Click. / \r\n Richard pushed the phone back into its cradle and slammed his car into reverse for twenty yards to have another look at the sign-post by the road junction he'd just sped past in the mist.  He had extracted himself from the Cambridge one-way system by the usual method, which involved going round and round it faster and faster until he achieved a sort of escape velocity and flew off at a tangent in a random direction, which he was now trying to identify and correct for.\r\n Arriving back at the junction he tried to correlate the information on the signpost with the information on the map.  But it couldn't be done.  The road junction was quite deliberately sitting on a page divide on the map, and the signpost was revolving maliciously in the wind.\r\n Instinct told him that he was heading in the wrong direction, but he didn't want to go back the way he'd come for fear of getting sucked back into the gravitational whirlpool of Cambridge's traffic system.\r\n He turned left, therefore, in the hope of finding better fortune in that direction, but after a while lost his nerve and turned a speculative right, and then chanced another exploratory left and after a few more such manoeuvres was thoroughly lost.\r\n He swore to himself and turned up the heating in the car.  If he had been concentrating on where he was going rather than trying to navigate and telephone at the same time, he told himself, he would at least know where he was now.  He didn't actually like having a telephone in his car, he found it a bother and an intrusion.  But Gordon had insisted and indeed had paid for it.\r\n He sighed in exasperation, backed up the black Saab and turned around again.  As he did so he nearly ran into someone lugging a body into a field.  At least that was what it looked like for a second to his overwrought brain, but in fact it was probably a local farmer with a sackful of something nutritious, though what he was doing with it on a night like this was anyone's guess.  As his headlights swung around again, they caught for a moment a silhouette of the figure trudging off across the field with the sack on his back.\r\n 'Rather him than me,' thought Richard grimly, and drove off again.\r\n After a few minutes he reached a junction with what looked a little more like a main road, nearly turned right down it, but then turned left instead.  There was no signpost.\r\n He poked at the buttons on his phone again.\r\n '…get back to you as soon as possible.  Maybe.'  /Beep. / 'Susan, it's Richard.  Where do I start?  What a mess.  Look I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.  I screwed up very badly, and it's all my fault.  And look, whatever it takes to make up for it, I'll do it, solemn promise…'\r\n He had a slight feeling that this wasn't the right tone to adopt with an answering machine, but he carried straight on.\r\n 'Honestly, we can go away, take a holiday for a week, or even just this weekend if you like.  Really, this weekend.  We'll go somewhere sunny.  Doesn't matter how much pressure Gordon tries to put on me, and you know the sort of pressure he can muster, he is your brother, after all.  I'll just… er, actually, it might have to be next weekend.  Damn, damn, damn.  It's just that I really have promised to get, no, look, it doesn't matter.  We'll just do it.  I don't care about getting /Anthem/ finished for Comdex.  It's not the end of the world.  We'll just go.\r\n Gordon will just have to take a running jump - Gaaarghhhh!'\r\n Richard swerved wildly to avoid the spectre of Gordon Way which suddenly loomed in his headlights and took a running jump at him.\r\n He slammed on the brakes, started to skid, tried to remember what it was you were supposed to do when you found yourself skidding, he knew he'd seen it on some television programme about driving he'd seen ages ago, what was the programme?  God, he couldn't even remember the title of the programme, let alone - oh yes, they'd said you mustn't slam on the brakes.  That was it.  The world swung sickeningly around him with slow and appalling force as the car slewed across the road, spun, thudded against the grass verge, then slithered and rocked itself to a halt, facing the wrong way.  He collapsed, panting, against the steering wheel.\r\n He picked up the phone from where he'd dropped it.\r\n 'Susan,' he gasped, 'I'll get back to you,' and hung up.\r\n He raised his eyes.\r\n Standing full in the glare of his headlights was the spectral figure of Gordon Way staring straight in through the windscreen with ghastly horror in its eyes, slowly raising its hand and pointing at him.\r\n He wasn't sure how long he just sat there.  The apparition had melted from view in a few seconds, but Richard simply sat, shaking, probably for not more than a minute, until a sudden squeal of brakes and glare of lights roused him.\r\n He shook his head.  He was, he realised, stopped in the road facing the wrong way.  The car that had just screeched to an abrupt halt almost bumper to bumper with him was a police car.  He took two or three deep breaths and then, stiff and trembling, he climbed out and stood up to face the officer who was walking slowly towards him, silhouetted in the police car's headlights.\r\n The officer looked him up and down.\r\n 'Er, I'm sorry, officer,' said Richard, with as much calmness as he could wrench into his voice.  'I, er, skidded.  The roads are slippery and I, er… skidded.  I spun round.  As you see, I, I'm facing the wrong way.'  He gestured at his car to indicate the way it was facing.\r\n 'Like to tell me why it was you skidded then, exactly, sir?'  The police officer was looking him straight in the eye while pulling out a notebook.\r\n 'Well, as I said,' explained Richard, 'the roads are slippery because of the mist, and, well, to be perfectly honest,' he suddenly found himself saying, in spite of all his attempts to stop himself, 'I was just driving along and I suddenly imagined that I saw my employer throwing himself in front of my car.'\r\n The officer gazed at him levelly.\r\n 'Guilt complex, officer,' added Richard with a twitch of a smile, 'you know how it is.  I was contemplating taking the weekend off.'\r\n The police officer seemed to hesitate, balanced on a knife edge between sympathy and suspicion.  His eyes narrowed a little but didn't waver.\r\n 'Been drinking, sir?'\r\n 'Yes,' said Richard, with a quick sigh, 'but very little.  Two glasses of wine max.  Er… and a small glass of port.  Absolute max.  It was really just a lapse of concentration.  I'm fine now.'\r\n 'Name?'\r\n Richard gave him his name and address.  The policeman wrote it all down carefully and neatly in his book, then peered at the car registration number and wrote that down too.\r\n 'And who is your employer then, sir?'\r\n 'His name is Way.  Gordon Way.'\r\n 'Oh,' said the policeman raising his eyebrows, 'the computer gentleman.'\r\n 'Er, yes, that's right.  I design software for the company.\r\n WayForward Technologies II.'\r\n 'We've got one of your computers down the station,' said the policeman.  'Buggered if I can get it to work.'\r\n 'Oh,' said Richard wearily, 'which model do you have?'\r\n 'I think it's called a Quark II.'\r\n 'Oh, well that's simple,' said Richard with relief.  'It doesn't work.  Never has done.  The thing is a heap of shit.'\r\n 'Funny thing, sir, that's what I've always said,' said the policeman.  'Some of the other lads don't agree.'\r\n 'Well, you're absolutely right, officer.  The thing is hopeless.  It's the major reason the original company went bust.  I suggest you use it as a big paperweight.'\r\n 'Well, I wouldn't like to do that, sir,' the policeman persisted.\r\n 'The door would keep blowing open.'\r\n 'What do you mean, officer?'  asked Richard.\r\n 'I use it to keep the door closed, sir.  Nasty draughts down our station this time of year.  In the summer, of course, we beat suspects round the head with it.'\r\n He flipped his book closed and prodded it into his pocket.\r\n"

        "text":"Mr Comey - perhaps because he knew the investigation would leak to the press anyway or possibly because he feared the emails could reveal Clinton misdeeds after she had won the presidency - decided otherwise.\r\n \"I stared at 'speak' and 'conceal'.  Speak would be really bad.  There's an election in 11 days.  Lordy, that would be really bad.  Concealing, in my view, would be catastrophic, not just to the FBI, but well beyond.  And honestly, as between really bad and catastrophic, I said to my team we got to walk into the world of really bad.  I've got to tell Congress that we're restarting this, not in some frivolous way, in a hugely significant way.\"\r\n\r\n Media coverage of Mr Comey's statement has focused on the \"catastrophic\" versus \"really bad\" dichotomy he constructed.  The director tacitly acknowledged that he knew the impact his letter would have on the presidential campaign, but he wanted to let everyone know that the alternative was much, much worse.\r\n\r\n If silence meant active concealment, he argued, then the prudent move was disclosure.\r\n\r\n The last line of this passage, however - that the investigation was being restarted in a \"hugely significant way\" - is equally important.\r\n\r\n At the time of Mr Comey's letter to Congress, many pundits and analysts were saying that the FBI must have found some very critical evidence, given that the director had to have known the monumental impact of his action.\r\n\r\n It turns out the evidence wasn't there, of course.  That left Mr Comey with the task on Wednesday of convincing the senators, and the public at large, that - knowing what he knew in October - his actions were still justified.\r\n \"Look, this terrible.  It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election.  But honestly, it wouldn't change the decision.\"\r\n Mr Comey arrives at this conclusion after recounting how his investigative team had found thousands of new Clinton emails, including some that were classified, on Mr Weiner's laptop, but did not discover anything that indicated criminal intent.\r\n\r\n He then decided, two days before the election, to send another letter informing Congress that he had ended the investigation with no change in the FBI's original determination not to bring charges against Mrs Clinton.\r\n\r\n The entire saga probably leaves Mrs Clinton's supporters more than just \"mildly\" nauseous.\r\n\r\n For Mr Trump's backers, on the other hand, it's much ado about nothing - an attempt, according to the president, to shift blame for electoral defeat away from the Democrats and onto the FBI.\r\n\r\n Mr Comey says he wouldn't change his decision, but it's one that will be second-guessed and scrutinised for a very long time to come."

        "text":" “What about the passports?”\r\n\r\n “What’s the guy’s name?”\r\n\r\n “Doc somebody.  I’ve got his number.”\r\n\r\n “Give it to me.  Tell him I’ll call in a day or so.  How much money do you have?”\r\n\r\n “I’m glad you asked.  I started with fifty thousand, right?  I’ve spent ten thousand on airfare, hotels, luggage and rental cars.  And I’m still spending.  Now you want a video camera.  And fake IDs.  I’d hate to lose money on this deal.”\r\n\r\n Mitch started for the door.  “How about another fifty thousand?”\r\n\r\n “I’ll take it.”\r\n\r\n He winked at her and closed the door, wondering if he would ever see her again.\r\n * * * \r\n The cell was eight by eight, with a toilet in a corner and a set of bunk beds.  The top bunk was uninhabited and had been for a year.  Ray lay on the bottom bunk with wires running from his ears.  He spoke to himself in a very foreign language.  Turkish.  At that moment on that floor, it was safe to bet he was the only soul listening to Berlitz jabber in Turkish.  There was quiet talk up and down the hall, but most lights were out.  Eleven o’clock, Tuesday night.\r\n\r\n The guard walked silently to his cell.  “McDeere,” he said softly, secretly, through the bars.  Ray sat on the edge of the bed, under the bunk above, and stared at him.  He removed the wires.\r\n\r\n “Warden wants to see you.”\r\n\r\n Sure, he thought, the warden’s sitting at his desk at 11 P.M. waiting on me.  “Where are we going?”  It was an anxious question.\r\n\r\n “Put your shoes on and come on.”\r\n\r\n Ray glanced around the cell and took a quick inventory of his worldly possessions.  In eight years he had accumulated a black-and-white television, a large cassette player, two cardboard boxes full of tapes and several dozen books.  He made three dollars a day working in the prison laundry, but after cigarettes there had been little to spend on tangibles.  These were his only assets.  Eight years.\r\n\r\n The guard fitted a heavy key in the door and slid it open a few inches.  He turned off the light.  “Just follow me, and no cute stuff.  I don’t know who you are, mister, but you got some heavy-duty friends.”\r\n\r\n Other keys fit other doors, and they were outside under the basketball hoop.  “Stay behind me,” the guard said.\r\n\r\n Ray’s eyes darted around the dark compound.  The wall loomed like a mountain in the distance, beyond the courtyard and walking area where he had paced a thousand miles and smoked a ton of cigarettes.  It was sixteen feet tall in the daylight, but looked much larger at night.  The guard towers were fifty yards apart and well lit.  And heavily armed.\r\n\r\n The guard was casual and unconcerned.  Of course, he had a uniform and a gun.  He moved confidently between two cinder-block buildings, telling Ray to follow and be cool.  Ray tried to be cool.  They stopped at the corner of a building, and the guard gazed at the wall, eighty feet away.  Floodlights made a routine sweep of the courtyard, and they backed into the darkness.\r\n\r\n Why are we hiding?Ray asked himself.  Are those guys up there with the guns on our side?\r\n\r\n He would like to know before he made any dramatic moves.\r\n\r\n The guard pointed to the exact spot on the wall where James Earl Ray and his gang went over.  A rather famous spot, studied and admired by most of the inmates at Brushy Mountain.  Most of the white ones anyway.  “In about five minutes, they’ll throw a ladder up there.  The wire has already been cut on top.  You’ll find a heavy rope on the other side.”\r\n\r\n “Mind if I ask a few questions?”\r\n\r\n “Make it quick.”\r\n\r\n “What about all these lights?”\r\n\r\n “They’ll be diverted.  You’ll have total darkness.”\r\n\r\n “And those guns up there?”\r\n\r\n “Don’t worry.  They’ll look the other way.”\r\n\r\n “Dammit!  Are you sure?”\r\n\r\n “Look, man, I’ve seen some inside jobs before, but this takes the cake.  Warden Lattemer himself planned this one.  He’s right up there.”  The guard pointed to the nearest tower.\r\n\r\n “The warden?”\r\n\r\n “Yep.  Just so nothing’ll go wrong.”\r\n\r\n “Who’s throwing up the ladder?”\r\n\r\n “Coupla guards.”\r\n\r\n Ray wiped his forehead with his sleeve and breathed deeply.  His mouth was dry and his knees were weak.\r\n\r\n The guard whispered, “There’ll be a dude waiting for you.  His name is Bud.  White dude.  He’ll find you on the other side, and just do what he says.”\r\n\r\n The floodlights swept through again, then died.  “Get ready,” the guard said.  Darkness settled in, followed by a dreadful silence.  The wall was now black.  From the nearest tower, a whistle blew two short signals.  Ray knelt and watched.\r\n\r\n From behind the next building, he could see the silhouettes running to the wall.  They grabbed at something in the grass, then hoisted it.\r\n\r\n “Run, dude,” the guard said.  “Run!”\r\n\r\n Ray sprinted with his head low.  The homemade ladder was in place.  The guards grabbed his arms and threw him to the first step.  The ladder bounced as he scurried up the two-by-fours.  The top of the wall was two feet wide.  A generous opening had been cut in the coiled barbed wire.  He slid through without touching it.  The rope was right where it was supposed to be, and he eased down the outside of the wall.  Eight feet from pay dirt, he turned loose and jumped.  He squatted and looked around.  Still dark.  The floodlights were on hold.\r\n\r\n The clearing stopped a hundred feet away, and the dense woods began.  “Over here,” the voice said calmly.  Ray started for it.  Bud was waiting in the first cluster of black bushes.\r\n\r\n “Hurry.  Follow me.”\r\n\r\n Ray followed him until the wall was out of sight.  They stopped in a small clearing next to a dirt trail.  He stuck out a hand.  “I’m Bud Riley.  Kinda fun, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\n “Unbelievable.  Ray McDeere.”\r\n\r\n Bud was a stocky man with a black beard and a black beret.  He wore combat boots, jeans and a camouflage jacket.  No gun was in sight.  He offered Ray a cigarette.\r\n\r\n “Who are you with?”  Ray asked.\r\n\r\n “Nobody.  I just do a little free-lance work for the warden.  They usually call me when somebody goes over the wall.  Course, this is a little different.  Usually I bring my dogs.  I thought we’d wait here for a minute until the sirens go off, so you can hear.  Wouldn’t be right if you didn’t get to hear ’em.  I mean, they’re sorta in your honor.”\r\n\r\n “That’s okay.  I’ve heard them before.”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, but it’s different out here when they go off.  It’s a beautiful sound.”\r\n\r\n “Look, Bud, I  —  ”\r\n\r\n “Just listen, Ray.  We got plenty of time.  They won’t chase you, much.”\r\n\r\n “Much?”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, they gotta make a big scene, wake everybody up, just like a real escape.  But they ain’t coming after you.  I don’t know what kinda pull you got, but it’s something.”\r\n\r\n The sirens began screaming, and Ray jumped.  Lights flashed across the black sky, and the faint voices of the tower guards were audible.\r\n\r\n “See what I mean?”\r\n\r\n “Let’s go,” Ray said, and began walking.\r\n\r\n “My truck’s just up the road a piece.  I brought you some clothes.  Warden gave me your sizes.  Hope you like them.”\r\n\r\n Bud was out of breath when they reached the truck.  Ray quickly changed into the olive Duckheads and navy cotton work shirt.  “Very nice, Bud,” he said.\r\n\r\n “Just throw them prison clothes in the bushes.”\r\n\r\n They drove the winding mountain trail for two miles, then turned onto blacktop.  Bud listened to Conway Twitty and said nothing.\r\n\r\n “Where are we going, Bud?”  Ray finally asked.\r\n\r\n “Well, the warden said he didn’t care and really didn’t want to know.  Said it was up to you.  I’d suggest we get to a big town where there’s a bus station.  After that, you’re on your own.”\r\n\r\n “How far will you drive me?”\r\n\r\n “I got all night, Ray.  You name the town.”\r\n\r\n “I’d like to get some miles behind us before I start hanging around a bus station.  How about Knoxville?”\r\n\r\n “Knoxville it is.  Where are you going from there?”\r\n\r\n “I don’t know.  I need to get out of the country.”\r\n\r\n “With your friends, that should be no problem.  Be careful, though.  By tomorrow, your picture will be hanging in every sheriff’s office in ten states.”\r\n\r\n Three cars with blue lights came blazing over the hill in front of them.  Ray ducked onto the floorboard.\r\n\r\n “Relax, Ray.  They can’t see you.”\r\n\r\n He watched them disappear through the rear window.  “What about roadblocks?”\r\n\r\n “Look, Ray.  Ain’t gonna be no roadblocks, okay?  Trust me.”  Bud stuck a hand in a pocket and threw a wad of cash on the seat.  “Five hundred bucks.  Hand-delivered by the warden.  You got some stout friends, buddy.”\r\n\r\n Chapter 34\r\n\r\n Wednesday morning.  Tarry Ross climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of the Phoenix Park Hotel.  He paused on the landing outside the hall door and caught his breath.  Sweat beaded across his eyebrows.  He removed the dark sunglasses and wiped his face with the sleeve of his overcoat.  Nausea hit below the belt, and he leaned on the stair rail.  He dropped his empty briefcase on the concrete and sat on the bottom step.  His hands shook like severe palsy, and he wanted to cry.  He clutched his stomach and tried not to vomit.\r\n\r\n The nausea passed, and he breathed again.  Be brave, man, be brave.  There’s two hundred thousand waiting down the hall.  If you got guts, you can go in there and get it.  You can walk out with it, but you must have courage.  He breathed deeper, and his hands settled down.  Guts, man, guts.\r\n\r\n The weak knees wobbled, but he made it to the door.  Down the hall, past the rooms.  Eighth door on the right.  He held his breath, and knocked.\r\n\r\n Seconds passed.  He watched the dark hall through the dark glasses and could see nothing.  “Yeah,” a voice inside said, inches away.\r\n\r\n “It’s Alfred.”  Ridiculous name, he thought.  Where’d it come from?\r\n\r\n The door cracked, and a face appeared behind the little chain.  The door closed, then opened wide.  Alfred walked in.\r\n\r\n “Good morning, Alfred,” Vinnie Cozzo said warmly.  “Would you like coffee?”\r\n\r\n “I didn’t come here for coffee,” Alfred snapped.  He placed the briefcase on the bed and stared at Cozzo.\r\n\r\n “You’re always so nervous, Alfred.  Why don’t you relax.  There’s no way you can get caught.”\r\n\r\n “Shut up, Cozzo.  Where’s the money?”\r\n\r\n Vinnie pointed to a leather handbag.  He stopped smiling.  “Talk to me, Alfred.”\r\n\r\n The nausea hit again, but he kept his feet.  He stared at them.  His heart beat like pistons.  “Okay, your man, McDeere, has been paid a million bucks already.  Another million is on the way.  He’s delivered one load of Bendini documents and claims to have ten thousand more.”  A sharp pain hit his groin, and he sat on the edge of the bed.  He removed his glasses.\r\n\r\n “Keep talking,” Cozzo demanded.\r\n\r\n “McDeere’s talked to our people many times in the last six months.  He’ll testify at the trials, then hit the road as a protected witness.  He and his wife.”\r\n\r\n “Where are the other documents?”\r\n\r\n “Dammit, I don’t know.  He won’t tell.  But they’re ready to be delivered.  I want my money, Cozzo.”\r\n\r\n Vinnie threw the handbag on the bed.  Alfred opened it and the briefcase.  He attacked the stacks of bills, his hands shaking violently.\r\n\r\n “Two hundred thousand?”  he asked desperately.\r\n\r\n Vinnie smiled.  “That was the deal, Alfred.  I got another job for you in a couple of weeks.”\r\n\r\n “No way, Cozzo.  I can’t take any more of this.”  He slammed the briefcase shut and ran to the door.  He stopped and tried to calm himself.  “What will you do with McDeere?”  he asked, staring at the door.\r\n\r\n “What do you think, Alfred?”\r\n\r\n He bit his lip, clenched the briefcase and walked from the room.  Vinnie smiled and locked the door.  He pulled a card from his pocket and placed a call to the Chicago home of Mr. Lou Lazarov.\r\n\r\n Tarry Ross walked in panic down the hall.  He could see little from behind the glasses.  Seven doors down, almost to the elevator, a huge hand reached from the darkness and pulled him into a room.  The hand slapped him hard, and another fist landed in his stomach.  Another fist to the nose.  He was on the floor, dazed and bleeding.  The briefcase was emptied on the bed.\r\n\r\n He was thrown into a chair, and the lights came on.  Three FBI agents, his comrades, glared at him.  Director Voyles walked up to him, shaking his head in disbelief.  The agent with the huge, efficient hands stood nearby, within striking distance.  Another agent was counting money.\r\n\r\n Voyles leaned into his face.  “You’re a traitor, Ross.  The lowest form of scum.  I can’t believe it.”\r\n\r\n Ross bit his lip and began sobbing.\r\n\r\n “Who is it?”  Voyles asked intently.\r\n\r\n The crying was louder.  No answer.\r\n\r\n Voyles swung wildly and slapped Ross’s left temple.  He shrieked in pain.  “Who is it, Ross?  Talk to me.”\r\n\r\n “Vinnie Cozzo,” he blurted between sobs.\r\n\r\n “I know it’s Cozzo!  Dammit!  I know that!  But what did you tell him?”\r\n\r\n Tears ran from his eyes and blood poured from his nose.  His body shook and gyrated pitifully.  No answer.\r\n\r\n Voyles slapped him again, and again.  “Tell me, you little sonofabitch.  Tell me what Cozzo wants.”  He slapped him again.\r\n\r\n Ross doubled over and dropped his head on his knees.  The crying softened.\r\n\r\n “Two hundred thousand dollars,” an agent said.\r\n\r\n Voyles dropped to one knee and almost whispered to Ross.  “Is it McDeere, Ross?  Please, oh please, tell me it’s not McDeere.  Tell me, Tarry, tell me it’s not McDeere.”\r\n\r\n Tarry stuck his elbows on his knees and stared at the floor.  The blood dripped neatly into one little puddle on the carpet.  Gut check, Tarry.  You don’t get to keep your money.  You’re on the way to jail.  You’re a disgrace, Tarry.  You’re a slimy little scuzzball of a chicken, and it’s over.  What could possibly be gained by keeping secrets?  Gut check, Tarry.\r\n\r\n Voyles was pleading softly.  Sinners, won’t you come?  “Please say it ain’t McDeere, Tarry, please tell me it ain’t.”\r\n\r\n Tarry sat straight and wiped his eyes with his fingers.  He breathed deeply.  Cleared his throat.  He bit his lip, looked squarely at Voyles and nodded.\r\n * * * \r\n DeVasher had no time for the elevator.  He ran down the stairs to the fourth floor, to the corner, a power one, and barged into Locke’s office.  Half the partners were there.  Locke, Lambert, Milligan, McKnight, Dunbar, Denton, Lawson, Banahan, Kruger, Welch and Shottz.  The other half had been summoned.\r\n\r\n A quiet panic filled the room.  DeVasher sat at the head of the conference table, and they gathered around.\r\n\r\n “Okay, boys.  It’s not time to haul ass and head for Brazil.  Not yet, anyway.  We confirmed this morning that he has talked extensively to the Fibbies, that they have paid him a million cash, that they have promised another million, that he has certain documents that are believed to be fatal.  This came straight from the FBI.  Lazarov and a small army are flying into Memphis as we speak.  It appears as though the damage has not been done.  Yet.  According to our source  —  a very high-ranking Fibbie  —  McDeere has over ten thousand documents in his possession, and he is ready to deliver.  But he has only delivered a few so far.  We think.  Evidently, we have caught this thing in time.  If we can prevent further damage, we should be okay.  I say this, even though they have some documents.  Obviously, they don’t have much or they would’ve been here with search warrants.”\r\n\r\n DeVasher was onstage.  He enjoyed this immensely.  He spoke with a patronizing smile and looked at each of the worried faces.  “Now, where is McDeere?”\r\n\r\n Milligan spoke.  “In his office.  I just talked to him.  He suspects nothing.”\r\n\r\n “Wonderful.  He’s scheduled to leave in three hours for Grand Cayman.  Correct, Lambert?”\r\n\r\n “That’s correct.  Around noon.”\r\n\r\n “Boy, the plane will never make it.  The pilot will land in New Orleans for an errand, then he’ll take off for the island.  About thirty minutes over the Gulf, the little blip will disappear from radar, forever.  Debris will scatter over a thirty-square-mile area, and no bodies will ever be found.  It’s sad, but necessary.”\r\n\r\n “The Lear?”  asked Denton.\r\n\r\n “Yes, son, the Lear.  We’ll buy you another toy.”\r\n\r\n “We’re assuming a lot, DeVasher,” Locke said.  “We’re assuming the documents already in their possession are harmless.  Four days ago you thought McDeere had copied some of Avery’s secret files.  What gives?”\r\n\r\n “They studied the files in Chicago.  Yeah, they’re full of incriminating evidence, but not enough to move with.  They couldn’t get the first conviction.  You guys know the damning materials are on the island.  And, of course, in the basement.  No one can penetrate the basement.  We checked the files in the condo.  Everything looked in order.”\r\n\r\n Locke was not satisfied.  “Then where did the ten thousand come from?”\r\n\r\n “You’re assuming he has ten thousand.  I rather doubt it.  Keep in mind, he’s trying to collect another one million bucks before he takes off.  He’s probably lying to them and snooping around for more documents.  If he had ten thousand, why wouldn’t the Fibbies have them by now?”\r\n\r\n “Then what’s to fear?”  asked Lambert.\r\n\r\n “The fear is the unknown, Ollie.  We don’t know what he’s got, except that he’s got a million bucks.  He’s no dummy, and he just might stumble across something if left alone. "

        "text":"I was walking along by the palace pond when I heard Tim the Tadpole’s squeaky voice saying, “Bertie can I have a puppy?  Oh please Bertie.  I would so love to have a pet to play with.”\r\n\r\n Bertie was looking a bit stumped for a reply, because he doesn’t like to say, “no,” but he can’t always do what Tim wants.  Even though he used to be a prince, he can’t do everything.  In fact, now that he’s a frog, most things are more difficult than ever: Except for hopping, and catching flies with his tongue.\r\n\r\n Before Bertie could explain to Tim why it’s tricky for a tadpole to keep a puppy, Colin the Carp butted in, “Oh dear.  Is there no end to the silly questions of little tadpoles?  You can’t have a pet that’s bigger than yourself.  If you had a puppy, you would be the puppy’s pet – or his breakfast.”\r\n\r\n “Oh yes you can have a pet that’s bigger than yourself,” said Bertie.  “The queen once had a camel and that was even bigger than her majesty.”\r\n\r\n “Well you can’t have a pet that’s big enough to eat you,” said Colin.  “And Tim wouldn’t even make a light snack for a puppy.  He would be like a little morsel on the end of his tongue.”\r\n\r\n “Oh yes you can have a pet that’s big enough to eat you,” said Bertie.  “When I was a prince, I had a lion for a pet.”\r\n\r\n ‘Rubbish!”  Said Colin.  “You’re just making up stories again.”\r\n\r\n “Well I’m allowed to make up stories,” said Bertie, “Because that’s what I’m best at.  But this one happens to be true.”\r\n\r\n Then Bertie told all the pond life the story of how he had a lion as a pet.  I stopped to listen because it sounded jolly interesting.\r\n\r\n One time when Bertie was still a small princeling, he went with his mother to the pet shop.  This all happened in the good old days before the wicked queen took over and turned Bertie into a frog.  Bertie’s mother was much nicer, although a little bit eccentric, which meant that her ideas were sometimes out of the ordinary.  She wanted to buy a camel because she thought it would look interesting roaming around the palace grounds.  The shopkeeper considered himself to be a bit of a whit, so he said to the queen,“Ah yes Ma’am, a camel.  Will that be one hump or two?”\r\n\r\n The queen gave the shopkeeper one of her stares, as if she meant his head to be chopped off.  So he stuttered, “Of course Ma’am.  I do so apologise.  Right now we are out of camels.  But we do have all sorts of interesting animals fresh in from Africa.  For instance, we have handsome lion cub.  A lion is rather more royal than a camel if you don’t mind me saying so.”\r\n\r\n The queen was about to say, “You silly little man!  Lions are for statues, not pets,” but Prince Bertie had already run over to the cub’s corner of the shop.  He was so small, fluffy and cute, and he also looked just a bit sad to be living in a box.  He gave Berte a tiny little roar.\r\n\r\n “Rawwwwwr!”\r\n\r\n So Bertie said, “Mummy, Mummy.  Do let’s have a lion cub.  I promise I’ll look after him all by myself.  Honest I will.  I’ll keep him with me always and we’ll be bestest friends.”\r\n\r\n Bertie’s mother sometimes seemed a bit fierce, but she was a big softie really, and she thought that the lion cub looked very cute and harmless too.  So she gave the shopkeeper a gold coin and they took the cub home to the palace.\r\n\r\n Bertie called him Tiddles because he thought that was a funny name for a lion.  The queen said that it was alright for friends to call him Tiddles, but that he would have to have an official name too for special occasions.  So she said that his proper name would be Leopold the First.\r\n\r\n Leopold the First, or Tiddles as everybody called him, loved living in the palace.  At night he slept in Bertie’s bed where he looked just like a fluffy toy lion.  During the day he liked sitting on the roof and watching everyone come and go.  Up there, he looked just like a statue of a lion, until he started to move and prowl along the battlements – which gave anyone who noticed a big surprise.  At other times he went for walks around the palace grounds, and everyone agreed that he was far more interesting and royal than a camel would ever have been.\r\n\r\n For breakfast, Tiddles ate raw steak.  For lunch he ate raw steak… And for supper he ate raw steak.\r\n\r\n Tiddles grew, and he grew – and he became quite big.\r\n\r\n But however big he became, he still loved Bertie.  When he saw Bertie coming home from School, he would leap off the roof of the palace into the branches of a big oak tree, then he would climb down and bound up the drive to greet Bertie.  He would jump up and hug him with his paws and lick his face.  Then they would run into the grounds and play soccer together.  Tiddles was great at dribbling the ball with his nose.  Though one day when he was hungry he ate Bertie’s best football boots, but Bertie didn’t mind because he loved Tiddles so very much.\r\n\r\n Anther game they liked playing was frightening the royal nanny.  Tiddles and Bertie would both hide behind the curtains, and when they heard her coming along calling, “Bertie.  It’s way past your bedtime young prince!”\r\n\r\n The would both leap out and roar like this… “RAAWWWWWWWWR!”\r\n\r\n She would be so frightened that she would run off to her room – and Bertie and Tiddles could say up for another half an hour and play.\r\n\r\n But one day the king said to Bertie over breakfast, “That cub of yours has become quite a lion.  He’s already growing a mane.  It’s time he went to the zoo.”\r\n\r\n “The zoo!”  Said Bertie.  “You can’t put Tiddles behind bars!  And besides, I love him !  You should think of my feelings too Daddy!”\r\n\r\n Of course the king didn’t want to make Bertie sad, so he agreed that Tiddles could live in the palace a little longer.  But then one day Tiddles did something that made the king cross.  Very cross indeed.\r\n\r\n He had just appointed a new prime minister.  The prime minister and all the grandest and most important people in the land came to see the king in the palace… Tiddles was waiting for them.\r\n\r\n By now Tiddles wasn’t quite a grown up lion but he was no longer a cub.  By the standards of cats he was big.  Well actually, he was huge.  If you didn’t know him, you would be quite scared to meet him.  In fact, you would be terrified.\r\n\r\n A big velvet curtain hung behind the throne, and sometimes Tiddles liked to sleep behind it.  It was his hideaway place.\r\n\r\n When the new ministers trooped into the throne room to meet the king, three musicians sounded their trumpets.\r\n\r\n The sound woke up Tiddles and he thought that there would be a party with lots of music and games.  So he strolled out from behind the curtains, stretched out his body, and then turned around to lick his bottom.  In actual fact, he didn’t do anything very frightening at all – but the ministers were frightened.\r\n\r\n The Minister of War climbed out of the window and jumped into a rose bush where he tore his trousers on the thorns.  The prime minister had more mettle than that, and he picked up a chair and held it out in front of himself like a lion tamer.  Tiddles yawned and showed all his teeth.  That was too much.  The whole government including the Prime Minister leaped out of the widows.\r\n\r\n The king was furious because they trampled all over his roses.  He decided that he didn’t like the government after all, so he sacked the lot of them and appointed some new ministers.\r\n The next day the newspapers ran headlines like: “King throws ministers to the lions.”\r\n\r\n And\r\n\r\n “Lion-Taming Prime Minister Gets Sack.”\r\n\r\n The king was furious when he read the papers, and he resolved that Tiddles must go, immediately.  The new prime minister, who had replaced the old one who had run away from Tiddles, said he thought that the best place for a lion would be Africa.  In fact, everyone in the palace who loved Tiddles – and that was everyone except the royal nanny – all agreed that it would be a wonderful thing to set him free in the wild, where he could live the life of a real lion.\r\n\r\n So that’s what happened.  The Minister for Nature put Tiddles on a flight to Africa.  Before the plane left the tarmac, Prince Bertie came on board to give his pet a special goodbye hug.  Then the plane flew Tiddles to Tanzania in East Africa .  First he lived in a special sanctuary for lions.  Then they released him into the wild.  Bertie knew that things had turned out how they should, though he was very sad that he would never see his best friend again.\r\n\r\n Three years later, the royal family chose a very special holiday.  They went on safari in East Africa.  They travelled across the open bush in four-wheel drive cars and saw all the wild animals.  They had guides who carried guns just in case any creatures tried to attack them.  At night they slept in tents under the stars.\r\n\r\n One night they camped on the edge of the Ngorongoro Crater.  The king and queen decided to rest for the next day before continuing their safari.\r\n\r\n Bertie had become friendly with the chief guide whose name was Joshua.  He asked Joshua if had ever heard of a lion who had lived in a palace and been released into the wild.  To Bertie’s surprise, Joshua said that of course everyone who worked in the game reserve had heard the story of the royal lion called Tiddles.\r\n\r\n Now he was a big strong grown up lion, and was the leader of his pride (which is like a group of lions).\r\n\r\n He agreed to take Bertie the next morning to see Tiddles come down to his favorite watering hole.  He made Bertie promise to stay in the car, because Tiddles was a wild lion now and might be dangerous.\r\n\r\n So Bertie got up at 5AM.  Rosy red clouds still veiled the fierce African sun so that the air was still lovely and fresh.  The great Ngorongoro Crater was filled with mists so it looked like a witch’s cauldron.  Then the treetops started to emerge from the swirling brew.  They got into the car and slowly drove down the winding route into the base of the crater.  By now the sunlight was starting to play on the bark of the acacia trees.  Zebra and deer were grazing in the long grass, always watching with their big glassy eyes for any suspicious movement that could be a big cat hunting for its breakfast.\r\n\r\n Eventually they came to the watering hole where Joshua said that Tiddles like to come and drink sometimes.  He didn’t come here every day, so they would need to be lucky, and so they waited.\r\n\r\n Bertie saw lots of beautiful pink flamingos.  He saw a hippo give the biggest yawn he had ever seen, and eventually the grass began to move and a big lion followed by three lionesses began to gamble down to the water.  Although he was much bigger than when he had last seen him, Bertie knew right away that it was Tiddles.  Tiddles took no notice of the car.  He was used to tourists and didn’t think to see who was inside.  Instead he led his pride down to drink.  Bertie wound down the window and called out, “Tiddles,” but still Tiddles didn’t hear him.  So then Bertie did something very silly indeed.  He forgot about Joshua’s warning, and he opened the door of the car and jumped out onto the ground.  He started to walk towards Tiddles.  Joshua immediately leaped out of the driver’s seat and trained his gun on Tiddles.\r\n\r\n “Your Royal Highness,” he said.  “You had better get back into the car.  Just come back slowly.  Don’t run.  If you run they will attack you.”\r\n\r\n But Bertie carried on walking towards the lions and called out, “Tiddles, Tiddles, don’t you remember me?  I’m Bertie.  Your best friend.”\r\n\r\n Tiddles took his mouth up from the water and looked around at Bertie.  He stared at him for about half a minute, and then he started to bound towards him, with a great cat like spring in his step.  Joshua squeezed his trigger but his gun didn’t fire.  Dust had blown up from the wheels of the car had got into the gun and jammed it.  It all happened so fast.  Bertie didn’t have time to be afraid or to regret not taking Joshua’s advice.\r\n\r\n Tiddles feet took off from the ground.  He flew towards Bertie, wrapped his paws around him, and licked his face.  Then Bertie and Tiddles did a kind of dance under the acacia trees.  The friends were united and overjoyed to see each other once again.\r\n\r\n And that’s the story of how Bertie had a pet lion, set him free in the wild African bush, and then went out to meet him again.  Bertie says that if you are ever near a wild animal you must be ever so careful and follow all the instructions that you are given.  Wild animals are very beautiful but very dangerous."

The program soundproofing of the apartment did not cope with vibrations of one hundred and twenty decibels.  Through the cracks between the jalousie, decorated in Italian style, the indigo light of the lights of the floating drones seeped through.\r\n Managed remotely by the operator, the object was leveled with the tinted windows of the forty-ninth floor of the highest skyscraper in Burano, a very beautiful island district of Venice.  The building was the headquarters of Virtual Industries, a powerful corporation that worked with cyberspace, creating virtual reality and nanotechnology.\r\n The intellectual provision of the apartment signaled a possible threat.\r\n The semi-darkness of the office welcomed Dave with a three-day mess.  As is often the case after a long stay in the binary dimension, the hands and feet reluctantly obeyed him, the sense of the former lightness of his body went away, depressing the waking mind from cybershnel stronger than the foie gras that Dave feared as a deadly weapon due to individual intolerance to the product, Namely - allergies.  Only a couple of minutes later, Dave began to understand what was happening.  Judging by the alarming cacophony coming from other premises, something that the hacker feared since the very first minute of illegal penetration into the corporation happened.  He realized that his situation is terrible, as the security systems found him and now it will be very difficult for him to escape responsibility for hacking the system and downloading the company's secret materials.\r\n Having pulled out two black cords from the left wrist, Dave got up from his chair, at the speed started on the computer the procedure of emergency data formatting to hide every possible trace of his presence in the system of information channels \"Virtual Industries\" and rushed to the entrance to the living room, blocking access to the office with a sixteen-digit password.\r\n \"This should hold them for a while,\" he thought to himself, hurriedly packing his things into his bag.  Hiding an eight-shot revolver under his beloved poncho, Dave decided to get out of the building.  To escape, he needed to get to the time machine that he left on one of the floors of the skyscraper.  He inherited it from his late uncle, but she was very polluted with stone age dust that Dave could not stand, but the time machine was the only thing that could save him.\r\n Dave realized that his life was in great danger and although he was a rather brave man, fear began to absorb his soul.  He realized what a huge mistake he made.  And all for what?  He knew that his dependence on drugs, which would allow him to get rid of sleep and work day after day, would kill him, but he did not think so.\r\n Dave was a 25 year old cyber developer working for a small company called “Neurosphere”, in which he developed artificial intelligence and urban robotic systems.  He was a very gifted guy and worked well and high quality but paid very little.  Dave needed money to help his parents cover their huge debts, so the guy was forced to settle for a few more jobs.  In order to manage everything and work even harder, the guy started taking drugs, which resulted in a strong dependence and was forced to spend all the money that he earned, to buy expensive drugs.  It was in 2042. "

Alone.\r\n\r\n In the bedroom, he sat on the unopened Sony box and marveled at the roomful of documents.  Across the carpet she had built perfect columns of paper, all painstakingly divided into Cayman banks and Cayman companies.  On top of each stack was a yellow legal pad, with the company name followed by pages of dates and entries.  And names!\r\n\r\n Even Tarrance could follow the paper trail.  A grand jury would eat it up.  The U.S. Attorney would call press conferences.  And the trial juries would convict, and convict and convict.\r\n * * * \r\n Special Agent Jenkins yawned into the telephone receiver and punched the numbers to the Memphis office.  He had not slept in twenty-four hours.  Jones was snoring in the car.\r\n\r\n “FBI,” a male voice said.\r\n\r\n “Yeah, who’s there?”  Jenkins asked.  Just a routine check-in.\r\n\r\n “Acklin.”\r\n\r\n “Hey, Rick.  This is Jenkins.  We’ve  —  ”\r\n\r\n “Jenkins!  Where have you been?  Hold on!”\r\n\r\n Jenkins quit yawning and looked around the bus terminal.  An angry voice yelled into the earpiece.\r\n\r\n “Jenkins!  Where are you?”  It was Wayne Tarrance.\r\n\r\n “We’re at the bus station in Mobile.  We’ve lost him.”\r\n\r\n “You what?  How could you lose him?”\r\n\r\n Jenkins was suddenly alert and leaning into the phone.  “Wait a minute, Wayne.  Our instructions were to follow him for eight hours to see where he went.  Routine, you said.”\r\n\r\n “I can’t believe you lost him.”\r\n\r\n “Wayne, we weren’t told to follow him for the rest of his life.  Eight hours, Wayne.  We’ve followed for twenty hours, and he’s disappeared.  What’s the big deal?”\r\n\r\n “Why haven’t you called in before now?”\r\n\r\n “We called in twice.  In Birmingham and Montgomery.  Line was busy both times.  What’s going on, Wayne?”\r\n\r\n “Just a minute.”\r\n\r\n Jenkins grabbed the phone tighter and waited.  Another voice: “Hello, Jenkins?”\r\n\r\n “Yes.”\r\n\r\n “Director Voyles here.  What the hell happened?”\r\n\r\n Jenkins held his breath and looked wildly around the terminal.  “Sir, we lost him.  We followed him for twenty hours, and when he got off the bus here in Mobile, we lost him in the crowd.”\r\n\r\n “That’s great, son.  How long ago?”\r\n\r\n “Twenty minutes.”\r\n\r\n “All right, listen.  We desperately need to find him.  His brother has taken our money and disappeared.  Call the locals there in Mobile.  Tell them who you are, and that an escaped murderer is on the loose in town.  They’ve probably got Ray McDeere’s name and picture stuck to the walls.  His mother lives in Panama City Beach, so alert every local between there and Mobile.  I’m sending in our troops.”\r\n\r\n “Okay.  I’m sorry, sir.  We weren’t told to trail” him forever.”\r\n\r\n “We’ll discuss it later.”\r\n * * * \r\n At ten, Mitch called the Perdido Beach Hilton for the second time.  He asked for Rachel James.  No arrival.  He asked for Lee Stevens.  One moment, she said.  Mitch sat on the floor and waited intently.  The line to the room was ringing.  After a dozen rings, someone picked up.\r\n\r\n “Yeah.”  It was quick.\r\n\r\n “Lee?”  Mitch asked.\r\n\r\n A pause.  “Yeah.”\r\n\r\n “This is Mitch.  Congratulations.”\r\n\r\n Ray fell on the bed and closed his eyes.  “It was so easy, Mitch.  How’d you do it?”\r\n\r\n “I’ll tell you when we have time.  Right now, there are a bunch of folks trying to kill me.  And Abby.  We’re on the run.\r\n\r\n “Who, Mitch?”\r\n\r\n “It would take ten hours to tell the first chapter.  We’ll do it later.  Write this number down.  615-889-4380.”\r\n\r\n “That’s not Memphis.”\r\n\r\n “No, it’s Nashville.  I’m in an apartment that’s serving as mission control.  Memorize that number.  If I’m not here, the phone will be answered by a girl named Tammy.”\r\n\r\n “Tammy?”\r\n\r\n “It’s a long story.  Just do as I say.  Sometime tonight, Abby will check in there under the name of Rachel James.  She’ll be in a rented car.”\r\n\r\n “She’s coming here!”\r\n\r\n “Just listen, Ray.  The cannibals are chasing us, but we’re a step ahead of them.”\r\n\r\n “Ahead of who?”\r\n\r\n “The Mafia.  And the FBI.”\r\n\r\n “Is that all?”\r\n\r\n “Probably.  Now listen to me.  There is a slight chance Abby is being followed.  You’ve got to find her, watch her and make damned sure no one is behind her.”\r\n\r\n “And if they are?”\r\n\r\n “Call me, and we’ll talk about it.”\r\n\r\n “No problem.”\r\n\r\n “Don’t use the phone except to call this number.  And we can’t talk much.”\r\n\r\n “I’ve got a bunch of questions, little brother.”\r\n\r\n “And I’ve got the answers, but not now.  Take care of my wife and call me when she gets there.”\r\n\r\n “Will do.  And, Mitch, thanks.”\r\n\r\n “Adios.”\r\n * * * \r\n An hour later Abby turned off Highway 182 onto the winding driveway to the Hilton.  She parked the four-door Cutlass with Alabama tags and walked nervously under the sprawling veranda to the front doors.  She stopped for a second, looked behind her at the driveway and went inside.\r\n\r\n Two minutes later, a yellow cab from Mobile stopped under the veranda, behind the shuttle vans.  Ray watched the cab.  A woman was in the back seat leaning forward and talking to the driver.  They waited a minute.  She pulled money from her purse and paid him.  She got out and waited until the cab drove away.  The woman was a blonde, and that was the first thing he noticed.  Very shapely, with tight black corduroy pants.  And black sunglasses, which seemed odd to him because it was pushing midnight.  She walked suspiciously to the front doors, waited a minute, then went in.  He watched her carefully.  He moved toward the lobby.\r\n\r\n The blonde approached the only clerk behind the registration desk.  “A single room, please,” he heard her say.\r\n\r\n The clerk slid a registration form across the counter.  The blonde wrote her name and asked, “That lady who just checked in before me, what’s her name?  I think she’s an old friend.”\r\n\r\n The clerk nipped through the registration cards.  “Rachel James.”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, that’s her.  Where’s she from?”\r\n\r\n “It’s a Memphis address,” the clerk said.\r\n\r\n “What’s her room number?  I’d like to say hello.”\r\n\r\n “I can’t give room numbers,” the clerk said.\r\n\r\n The blonde quickly pulled two twenties from her purse and slid them across the counter.  “I just want to say hello.”\r\n\r\n The clerk took the money.  “Room 622.”\r\n\r\n The woman paid in cash.  “Where are the phones?”\r\n\r\n “Around the corner,” the clerk said.  Ray slid around the corner and found four pay phones.  He grabbed a middle one and began talking to himself.\r\n\r\n The blonde took a phone on the end and turned her back to him.  She spoke softly.  He could hear only pieces.\r\n\r\n “… checked in … Room 622… Mobile… some help … I can’t … an hour? … yes… hurry…”\r\n\r\n She hung up, and he talked louder into his dead phone.\r\n\r\n Ten minutes later, there was a knock at the door.  The blonde jumped from the bed, grabbed her .45  and stuck it in the corduroys under the shirt.  She ignored the safety chain and cracked the door.\r\n\r\n It burst open and knocked her against the wall.  Ray lunged at her, grabbed the gun and pinned her to the floor.  With her face in the carpet, he stuck the barrel of the .45 in her ear.  “If you make a sound, I’ll kill you!”\r\n\r\n She stopped struggling and closed her eyes.  No response.\r\n\r\n “Who are you?”  Ray demanded.  He pushed the barrel deeper into her ear.  Again, no response.\r\n\r\n “Not a move, not a sound.  Okay?  I’d love to blow your head off.”\r\n\r\n He relaxed, still sitting on her back, and ripped open her flight bag.  He dumped its contents on the floor and found a pair of clean tennis socks.  “Open your mouth,” he demanded.\r\n\r\n She did not move.  The barrel returned to her ear, and she slowly opened her mouth.  Ray crammed the socks in between her teeth, then tightly blindfolded her with the silk nightshirt.  He bound her feet and hands with panty hose, then ripped the bedsheets into long strips.  The woman did not move.  When he finished the binding and gagging, she resembled a mummy.  He slid her under the bed.\r\n\r\n The purse contained six hundred dollars in cash and a wallet with an Illinois driver’s license.  Karen Adair from Chicago.  Date of birth: March 4, 1962.  He took the wallet and gun.\r\n * * * \r\n The phone rang at 1 A.M., and Mitch was not asleep.  He was in bank records up to his waist.  Fascinating bank records.  Highly incriminating.\r\n\r\n “Hello,” he answered cautiously.\r\n\r\n “Is this mission control?”  The voice was in the vicinity of a loud jukebox.\r\n\r\n “Where are you, Ray?”\r\n\r\n “A joint called the Floribama lounge.  Right on the state line.”\r\n\r\n “Where’s Abby?”\r\n\r\n “She’s in the car.  She’s fine.”\r\n\r\n Mitch breathed easier and grinned into the phone.  He listened.\r\n\r\n “We had to leave the hotel.  A woman followed Abby in  —  same woman you saw in some bar in the Caymans.  Abby is trying to explain everything.  The woman followed her all day and showed up at the hotel.  I took care of her, and we disappeared.”\r\n\r\n “You took care of her?”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, she wouldn’t talk, but she’s out of the way for a short time.”\r\n\r\n “Abby’s fine?”\r\n\r\n “Yeah.  We’re both dead tired.  Exactly what do you have in mind?”\r\n\r\n “You’re about three hours away from Panama City Beach.  I know you’re dead tired, but you need to get away from there.  Get to Panama City Beach, ditch the car and get two rooms at the Holiday Inn.  Call me when you check in.”\r\n\r\n “I hope you know what you’re doing.”\r\n\r\n “Trust me, Ray.”\r\n\r\n “I do, but I’m beginning to wish I was back in prison.”\r\n\r\n “You can’t go back, Ray.  We either disappear or we’re dead.”\r\n\r\n Chapter 36\r\n\r\n The cab stopped at a red light in downtown Nashville, and Mitch hopped out on stiff and aching legs.  He limped through the busy intersection dodging the morning traffic.\r\n\r\n The Southeastern Bank Building was a thirty-story glass cylinder, designed along the same lines as a tennis-ball can.  The tint was dark, almost black.  It stood prominently away from the street corner amidst a maze of sidewalks and fountains and manicured greenery.\r\n\r\n Mitch entered the revolving doors with a swarm of employees rushing to work.  In the marble-laden atrium he found the directory and rode the escalators to the third floor.  He opened a heavy glass door and walked into a large circular office.  A striking woman of forty or so watched him from behind the glass desk.  She offered no smile.\r\n\r\n “Mr. Mason Laycook, please,” he said.\r\n\r\n She pointed.  “Have a seat.”\r\n\r\n Mr. Laycook wasted no time.  He appeared from around a corner and was as sour as his secretary.  “May I help you?”  he asked through his nose.\r\n\r\n Mitch stood.  “Yes, I need to wire a little money.”\r\n\r\n “Yes.  Do you have an account at Southeastern?”\r\n\r\n “Yes.”\r\n\r\n “And your name?”\r\n\r\n “It’s a numbered account.”  In other words, you don’t get a name, Mr. Laycook.  You don’t need a name.\r\n\r\n “Very well.  Follow me.”  His office had no windows, no view.  A row of keyboards and monitors sat on the credenza behind his glass desk.  Mitch sat down.\r\n\r\n “The account number, please.”\r\n\r\n It came from memory.  “214-31-35.”\r\n\r\n Laycook pecked at his keyboard and watched a monitor.  “That’s a Code Three account, opened by a T. Hemphill, with access only by her and a certain male meeting the following physical requirements: approximately six feet tall, one seventy-five to one eighty-five, blue eyes, brown hair, about twenty-five or twenty-six years old.  You fit that description, sir.”  Laycook studied the screen.  “And the last four digits of your Social Security number are?”\r\n\r\n “8585.”\r\n\r\n “Very well.  You are accessed.  Now what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n “I want to wire in some funds from a bank in Grand Cayman.”\r\n\r\n Laycook frowned and took a pencil from his pocket.  “Which bank in Grand Cayman?”\r\n\r\n “Royal Bank of Montreal.”\r\n\r\n “What type of account?”\r\n\r\n “It’s a numbered account.”\r\n\r\n “I presume you have the number?”\r\n\r\n “499DFH2122.”\r\n\r\n Laycook wrote the number and stood.  “I’ll be just a moment.”  He left the room.\r\n\r\n Ten minutes passed.  Mitch tapped his bruised feet and looked at the monitors across the desk.\r\n\r\n Laycook returned with his supervisor, Mr. Nokes, a vice president of something.  Nokes introduced himself from behind the desk.  Both men appeared nervous.  They stared downward at Mitch.\r\n\r\n Nokes did the talking.  He held a small sheet of computer paper.  “Sir, that is a restricted account.  You must have certain information before we can start the wire.”\r\n\r\n Mitch nodded confidently.\r\n\r\n “The dates and amounts of the last three deposits, sir?”  They watched him intently, knowing he would fail.\r\n\r\n Again, it came from memory.  No notes.  “February third of this year, six and a half million.  December fourteenth, last year, nine point two million.  And October eighth, last year, eleven million.”\r\n\r\n Laycook and Nokes gaped at the small printout.  Nokes managed a tiny professional smile.  “Very well.  You are cleared to the Pen number.”\r\n\r\n Laycook stood ready with his pencil.\r\n\r\n “Sir, what is your Pen number?”  Nokes asked.\r\n\r\n Mitch smiled and recrossed his damaged legs.  “72083.”\r\n\r\n “And the terms of the wire?”\r\n\r\n “Ten million dollars wired immediately into this bank, account 214-31-35.  I’ll wait.”\r\n\r\n “It’s not necessary to wait, sir.”\r\n\r\n “I’ll wait.  When the wire is complete, I’ve got a few more for you.”\r\n\r\n “We’ll be a moment.  Would you like some coffee?”\r\n\r\n “No.  Thanks.  Do you have a newspaper?”\r\n\r\n “Certainly,” Laycook said.  “On the table there.”\r\n\r\n They scurried from the office, and Mitch’s pulse began its descent.  He opened the Nashville Tennessean and scanned three sections before he found a brief paragraph about the escape at Brushy Mountain.  No picture. "

Well, a new study suggests that your accuracy is, in fact, directly affected by your throwing speed and physics is to blame.\r\n\r\n The study, led by Madhusudhan Venkadesan of Yale and Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan of Harvard, and published in the most recent issue of Royal Society Open Science, used athlete data and mathematical modelling to better understand the physics behind hurling projectiles.  Initially, researchers thought that lower accuracy when throwing something fast was caused by human hands not being able to release a projectile at the right moment.  An early or late release, after all, greatly affects the projectile’s trajectory.\r\n\r\n But this new information also points a finger at the projectile’s overall speed, which can actually affect the trajectory regardless of how perfect your aim is.  Basically, even if you release a projectile at precisely the right time, throwing it too fast makes you far less accurate than if you were to throw it slowly.\r\n\r\n So, if you’re going to throw something where accuracy is more important than speed — like in darts, basketball, cornhole bean bag toss, beer pong (beirut), etc. — the researchers highly recommend you do it as softly as possible.  Toss darts at the dart board with slow deliberate motions.  The darts only need to go fast enough to stick in the board.  Take your time lining up shots during basketball games if you can — there’s a reason free throw percentages are so high.  In fact, according to the researchers, shooting your free throws underhand, or “granny style,” is the most accurate method.  And when you go to lob a crumpled piece of paper into the trash at the office, take it nice and easy if you want to impress your cubicle buddy.  Slow and steady won’t always win the race, but it will hit the target.\r\n\r\n http://lifehacker.com/want-to-hit-your-target-go-slow-and-steady-1795063898"

        "text":"I don't know if cockroaches dream, but i imagine that if they do, jewel wasps feature prominently in their nightmares.  These small, solitary tropical wasps are of little concern to us humans;  after all, they don't manipulate our minds so that they can serve us up as willing, living meals to their newborns, as they do to unsuspecting cockroaches.  It's the stuff of horror movies, quite literally: the jewel wasp and similar species inspired the chest-bursting horrors in the Alien franchise.  The story is simple, if grotesque: the female wasp controls the minds of the cockroaches she feeds to her offspring, taking away their sense of fear or will to escape their fate.  But unlike what we see on the big screen, it's not some incurable virus that turns a once healthy cockroach into a mindless zombie — it's venom.  Not just any venom, either: a specific venom that acts like a drug, targeting the cockroach's brain.\r\n\r\n Brains, at their core, are just neurons, whether we're talking human brains or insect brains.  There are potentially millions of venom compounds that can turn neurons on or off.  So it should come as no surprise that some venoms target the carefully protected central nervous system, including our brains.  Some leap their way over physiological hurdles, from remote injection locations around the body and past the blood-brain barrier, to enter their victims' minds.  Others are directly injected into the brain, as in the case of the jewel wasp and its zombie cockroach host.\r\n\r\n Making of a zombie\r\n\r\n Jewel wasps are a beautiful if terrifying example of how neurotoxic venoms can do much more than paralyze.  The wasp, which is often just a fraction of the size of her victim, begins her attack from above, swooping down and grabbing the roach with her mouth as she aims her “stinger” — a modified egg-laying body part called an ovipositor — at the middle of the body, the thorax, in between the first pair of legs.  The quick jab takes only a few seconds, and venom compounds work fast, paralyzing the cockroach temporarily so the wasp can aim her next sting with more accuracy.  With her long stinger, she targets her mind-altering venom into two areas of the ganglia, the insect equivalent of a brain.\r\n\r\n The wasp's stinger is so well tuned to its victim that it can sense where it is inside the cockroach's dome to inject venom directly into subsections of its brain.  The stinger is capable of feeling around in the roach's head, relying on mechanical and chemical cues to find its way past the ganglionic sheath (the insect's version of a blood-brain barrier) and inject venom exactly where it needs to go.  The two areas of the roach brain that she targets are very important to her;  scientists have artificially clipped them from cockroaches to see how the wasp reacts, and when they are removed, the wasp tries to find them, taking a long time with her stinger embedded in search of the missing brain regions.\r\n\r\n Then the mind control begins.  First the victim grooms itself, of all things;  as soon as the roach's front legs recover from the transient paralysis induced by the sting to the body, it begins a fastidious grooming routine that takes about half an hour.  Scientists have shown that this behavior is specific to the venom, as piercing the head, generally stressing the cockroach, or contact with the wasp without stinging activity did not elicit the same hygienic urge.  This sudden need for cleanliness can also be induced by a flood of dopamine in the cockroach's brain, so we think that the dopaminelike compound in the venom may be the cause of this germophobic behavior.  Whether the grooming itself is a beneficial feature of the venom or a side effect is debated.  Some believe that the behavior ensures a clean, fungus- and microbe-free meal for the vulnerable baby wasp;  others think it may merely distract the cockroach for some time as the wasp prepares the cockroach's tomb.\r\n\r\n Dopamine is one of those intriguing chemicals found in the brains of a broad spectrum of animal life, from insects all the way to humans, and its effects are vital in all these species.  In our heads, it's part of a mental “reward system”: floods of dopamine are triggered by pleasurable things.  Because it makes us feel good, dopamine can be wonderful, but it is also linked to addictive behaviors and the “highs” we feel from illicit substances like cocaine.  It's impossible for us to know if a cockroach also feels a rush of insect euphoria when its brain floods with dopamine — but I prefer to think it does.  (It just seems too gruesome for the animal to receive no joy from the terrible end it is about to meet.)\r\n\r\n\r\n Having grown — and nourished itself — inside its cockroach host, a wasp offspring emerges to start the macabre life cycle anew.  Credit: Alamy\r\n While the cockroach cleans, the wasp leaves her victim in search of a suitable location.  She needs a dark burrow where she can leave her child and the zombie-roach offering, and it takes a little time to find and prepare the right place.  When she returns about 30 minutes later, the venom's effects have taken over — the cockroach has lost all will to flee.  In principle, this state is temporary: if you separate an envenomated roach from its would-be assassin before the larva can hatch and feed and pupate, the zombification wears off within a week.  Unfortunately for the envenomated cockroach, that's simply too long.  Before its brain has a chance to return to normal, the young wasp has already had its fill and killed its host.\r\n\r\n The motor abilities of the roach remain intact, but the insect simply doesn't seem inclined to use them.  So the venom doesn't numb the animal's senses — it alters how its brain responds to them.  Scientists have even shown that the stimuli that normally elicit evasive action, such as touching the roach's wings or legs, still send signals to the animal's brain;  they just don't evoke a behavioral response.  That's because the venom mutes certain neurons so they are less active and responsive, leading to the roach's sudden lack of fear and willingness to be buried and eaten alive.  This venom activity requires toxins that target GABA-gated chloride channels.\r\n\r\n GABA, or γ-aminobutyric acid, is one of the most important neurotransmitters in insect — and human — brains.  If neuron activity is a party, then GABA is a wet blanket;  it dampens a neuron's ability to be triggered through activation of chloride channels.  When chloride channels open, they allow negative chloride ions to flow.  Because these ions like to hang out with positive ions, if these channels are open when a sodium channel happens to open, chloride ions can cross the membrane at almost the same pace as sodium ions, making it harder for the sodium ions to start the domino cascade that is neuron signaling.  Even though a neuron receives the “go” command, the action potential is stopped in its tracks.  GABA isn't a complete inhibitor, however — the chloride channels can't wholly keep up with the sodium channels, so a strong stimulus can overcome the dampening effect.  This dulling system is what the wasp co-opts to make the cockroach do her bidding.  Her venom is packed with GABA and two other compounds that also activate the same chloride receptors, β-alanine and taurine.  These also work to prevent the reuptake of GABA by neurons, prolonging the effect.\r\n\r\n Although these venom compounds can cut the brain activity that would make her prey flee, what they can't do is make their way to the right parts of the cockroach brain by themselves.  That's why the wasp has to inject them directly into the cockroach's ganglia.  Fortunately for her, in a convenient quirk of nature, the same venom that zombifies roach brains works like magic to produce the transient paralysis needed to line up the cranial injection.  GABA, β-alanine and taurine also temporarily shut down motor neurons, so the wasp needs only one venom to complete two very different tasks.\r\n\r\n With her prey calm and quiescent, the wasp can replenish her energy by breaking the roach's antennae and drinking some sweet, nutritious insect blood.  Then she leads her victim to its final resting place, using what remains of an antenna as an equestrian uses the reins on a bridle.  Once inside her burrow, she attaches one egg to the cockroach's leg, then seals her offspring and the roach in.\r\n\r\n Fresh meals\r\n\r\n As if the mind manipulation wasn't bad enough, the wasp's venom has one final trick.  While the roach awaits its inevitable doom, the venom slows down the roach's metabolism to ensure it lives long enough to be devoured still fresh.  One way metabolism can be measured is by how much oxygen is used up over time, as all animals (including us) use oxygen in the process of creating energy from food or fat stores.  Scientists have found that oxygen consumption by cockroaches that have been stung is much lower than that of their healthy roach friends.  They thought this might be the result of the reduced movement of the complacent victims, but even when paralysis is induced by using drugs or severing neurons, the stung cockroaches live longer.  The key to the prolonged survival seems to be hydration.  How exactly the venom acts to keep a roach hydrated is not known, but it ensures that when the wasp larva hatches from its egg, its meal is ready to eat.  And soon enough after that, a new wasp emerges from the burrow, leaving the roach carcass behind.\r\n\r\n Jewel wasp venom is only one example of neurotoxic venom taken to the extreme.  There are more than 130 species in the same wasp genus, including the newly described Ampulex dementor (named for the soul-sucking guards of the magical prison Azkaban in the Harry Potter series).  Ampulex belongs to a very large and diverse group of wasps, numbering at least in the hundreds of thousands of species, which are known for some serious mental manipulation.  All have a macabre life cycle: as adults, they feed like other wasps and bees, but as larvae, they must feed off other animals.  They're not quite independent, not quite parasites — they're parasite-ish, or as scientists call them, parasitoids.\r\n\r\n Cockroaches are not their only targets;  there are parasitoid wasps that lay their eggs in spiders, caterpillars and ants.  The temperate Northern Hemisphere wasp Agriotypus will dive underwater to attach her eggs to caddis fly larvae and can remain submerged for up to 15 minutes to accomplish her task.  The brave Lasiochalcidia wasps of Europe and Africa throw themselves into the nightmarish jaws of an ant lion, pry them apart and insert their eggs into its throat.  There are even wasps called hyperparasitoids that parasitize other wasps like themselves, such as Lysibia species of Europe and Asia, which will sniff out caterpillars parasitized by fellow parasitoid wasps in the genus Cotesia and lay eggs in the freshly pupated wasp larvae.  In some cases, multiple wasp species parasitize one another, leading to a Russian doll of parasitic interactions.\r\n\r\n And to ensure their safe passage from larva to adulthood, these wasps often gain more than just a meal from their hosts.  One of them turns its caterpillar hosts into undead bodyguards that will defend pupating young wasps that just ate through its body.  Another species' larva forces its spider host to spin it a deformed but durable web to protect its cocoon just before killing the arachnid.\r\n\r\n Whereas the wasps in this unusual family may have perfected the art of mind control, there are other venomous species whose toxins alter mental states.  There are even species whose neurotoxic compounds get through our own blood-brain barrier, a feat that no wasp venom can yet achieve.  But unlike cockroaches, we Homo sapiens have a strange affinity for substances that mess with our minds.  Although the roaches run from those that would twist their brains, some people are willing to pay upward of $500 for a dose of venom to have a similar experience.\r\n\r\n https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-a-wasp-turns-cockroaches-into-zombies1/"

        "text":"In the article below, GG101x expert and Greater Good Science Center writer Kira Newman synthesizes the extant research that ties increased happiness to greater health.\r\n\r\n By Kira Newman\r\n\r\n This essay originally appeared on Greater Good, the online magazine of the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\n Over the past decade, an entire industry has sprouted up promising the secrets to happiness.  There are best-selling books like The Happiness Project and The How of Happiness, and happiness programs like Happify and Tal-Ben Shahar’s Wholebeing Institute.\r\n\r\n Here at the Greater Good Science Center, we offer an online course on “The Science of Happiness” and boast a collection of research-based happiness practices on our new website, Greater Good in Action.\r\n\r\n But all of these books and classes raise the question: Why bother?  Many of us might prefer to focus on boosting our productivity and success rather than our positive emotions.  Or perhaps we’ve tried to get happier but always seem to get leveled by setbacks.  Why keep trying?\r\n\r\n Recently, a critical mass of research has provided what might be the most basic and irrefutable argument in favor of happiness: Happiness and good health go hand-in-hand.  Indeed, scientific studies have been finding that happiness can make our hearts healthier, our immune systems stronger, and our lives longer.\r\n\r\n Several of the studies cited below suggest that happiness causes better health;  others suggest only that the two are correlated  —  perhaps good health causes happiness but not the other way around.  Happiness and health may indeed be a virtuous circle, but researchers are still trying to untangle their relationship.  In the meantime, if you need some extra motivation to get happier, check out these six ways that happiness has been linked to good health. \r\n\r\n 1.  Happiness protects your heart\r\n\r\n Love and happiness may not actually originate in the heart, but they are good for it.  For example, a 2005 paper found that happiness predicts lower heart rate and blood pressure.  In the study, participants rated their happiness over 30 times in one day and then again three years later.  The initially happiest participants had a lower heart rate on follow-up (about six beats slower per minute), and the happiest participants during the follow-up had better blood pressure.\r\n\r\n Research has also uncovered a link between happiness and another measure of heart health: heart rate variability, which refers to the time interval between heartbeats and is associated with risk for various diseases.  In a 2008 study, researchers monitored 76 patients suspected to have coronary artery disease.  Was happiness linked to healthier hearts even among people who might have heart problems?  It seemed so: The participants who rated themselves as happiest on the day their hearts were tested had a healthier pattern of heart rate variability on that day. \r\n\r\n Over time, these effects can add up to serious differences in heart health.  In a 2010 study, researchers invited nearly 2,000 Canadians into the lab to talk about their anger and stress at work.  Observers rated them on a scale of one to five for the extent to which they expressed positive emotions like joy, happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, and contentment.  Ten years later, the researchers checked in with the participants to see how they were doing  —  and it turned out that the happier ones were less likely to have developed coronary heart disease.  In fact, for each one-point increase in positive emotions they had expressed, their heart disease risk was 22 percent lower.\r\n\r\n 2.  Happiness strengthens your immune system\r\n\r\n Do you know a grumpy person who always seems to be getting sick?  That may be no coincidence: Research is now finding a link between happiness and a stronger immune system.\r\n\r\n In a 2003 experiment, 350 adults volunteered to get exposed to the common cold (don’t worry, they were well-compensated).  Before exposure, researchers called them six times in two weeks and asked how much they had experienced nine positive emotions  —  such as feeling energetic, pleased, and calm  —  that day.  After five days in quarantine, the participants with the most positive emotions were less likely to have developed a cold.\r\n\r\n Some of the same researchers wanted to investigate why happier people might be less susceptible to sickness, so in a 2006 study they gave 81 graduate students the hepatitis B vaccine.  After receiving the first two doses, participants rated themselves on those same nine positive emotions.  The ones who were high in positive emotion were nearly twice as likely to have a high antibody response to the vaccine  —  a sign of a robust immune system.  Instead of merely affecting symptoms, happiness seemed to be literally working on a cellular level.\r\n\r\n A much earlier experiment found that immune system activity in the same individual goes up and down depending on their happiness.  For two months, 30 male dental students took pills containing a harmless blood protein from rabbits, which causes an immune response in humans.  They also rated whether they had experienced various positive moods that day.  On days when they were happier, participants had a better immune response, as measured by the presence of an antibody in their saliva that defends against foreign substances.\r\n\r\n 3.  Happiness combats stress\r\n\r\n Stress is not only upsetting on a psychological level but also triggers biological changes in our hormones and blood pressure.  Happiness seems to temper these effects, or at least help us recover more quickly. \r\n\r\n In the study mentioned above, where participants rated their happiness more than 30 times in a day, researchers also found associations between happiness and stress.  The happiest participants had 23 percent lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol than the least happy, and another indicator of stress  —  the level of a blood-clotting protein that increases after stress  —  was 12 times lower.\r\n\r\n Happiness also seems to carry benefits even when stress is inevitable.  In a 2009 study, some diabolically cruel researchers decided to stress out psychology students and see how they reacted.  The students were led to a soundproof chamber, where they first answered questions indicating whether they generally felt 10 feelings like enthusiasm or pride.  Then came their worst nightmare: They had to answer an exceedingly difficult statistics question while being videotaped, and they were told that their professor would evaluate their response.  Throughout the process, their heart was measured with an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine and a blood pressure monitor.  In the wake of such stress, the hearts of the happiest students recovered most quickly.\r\n\r\n 4.  Happy people have fewer aches and pains\r\n\r\n Want to learn specific, research-tested steps you can take toward happiness?  Check out our new site, Greater Good in Action.\r\n Unhappiness can be painful  —  literally.\r\n\r\n A 2001 study asked participants to rate their recent experience of positive emotions, then (five weeks later) how much they had experienced negative symptoms like muscle strain, dizziness, and heartburn since the study began.  People who reported the highest levels of positive emotion at the beginning actually became healthier over the course of the study, and ended up healthier than their unhappy counterparts.  The fact that their health improved over five weeks (and the health of the unhappiest participants declined) suggests that the results aren’t merely evidence of people in a good mood giving rosier ratings of their health than people in a bad mood.\r\n\r\n A 2005 study suggests that positive emotion also mitigates pain in the context of disease.  Women with arthritis and chronic pain rated themselves weekly on positive emotions like interest, enthusiasm, and inspiration for about three months.  Over the course of the study, those with higher ratings overall were less likely to experience increases in pain.\r\n\r\n 5.  Happiness combats disease and disability\r\n\r\n Happiness is associated with improvements in more severe, long-term conditions as well, not just shorter-term aches and pains.\r\n\r\n In a 2008 study of nearly 10,000 Australians, participants who reported being happy and satisfied with life most or all of the time were about 1.5 times less likely to have long-term health conditions (like chronic pain and serious vision problems) two years later.  Another study in the same year found that women with breast cancer recalled being less happy and optimistic before their diagnosis than women without breast cancer, suggesting that happiness and optimism may be protective against the disease.\r\n\r\n As adults become elderly, another condition that often afflicts them is frailty, which is characterized by impaired strength, endurance, and balance and puts them at risk of disability and death.  In a 2004 study, over 1,550 Mexican Americans ages 65 and older rated how much self-esteem, hope, happiness, and enjoyment they felt over the past week.  After seven years, the participants with more positive emotion ratings were less likely to be frail.  Some of the same researchers also found that happier elderly people (by the same measure of positive emotion) were less likely to have a stroke in the subsequent six years;  this was particularly true for men.\r\n\r\n 6.  Happiness lengthens our lives\r\n\r\n In the end, the ultimate health indicator might be longevity  —  and here, especially, happiness comes into play.  In perhaps the most famous study of happiness and longevity, the life expectancy of Catholic nuns was linked to the amount of positive emotion they expressed in an autobiographical essay they wrote upon entering their convent decades earlier, typically in their 20s.  Researchers combed through these writing samples for expressions of feelings like amusement, contentment, gratitude, and love.  In the end, the happiest-seeming nuns lived a whopping 7-10 years longer than the least happy.\r\n\r\n You don’t have to be a nun to experience the life-extending benefits of happiness, though.  In a 2011 study, almost 4,000 English adults ages 52-79 reported how happy, excited, and content they were multiple times in a single day.  Here, happier people were 35 percent less likely to die over the course of about five years than their unhappier counterparts.\r\n\r\n These two studies both measured specific positive emotions, but overall satisfaction with one’s life  —  another major indicator of happiness  —  is also linked to longevity.

Most of it, anyway.”\r\n\r\n “How many transfers?”\r\n\r\n “Three.”\r\n\r\n “Give me the first one.”\r\n\r\n “A million dollars to the Coast National Bank in Pensa-cola, to a numbered account, accessible to only one person, a white female, approximately fifty years of age.  I will provide her with the Pen number.”\r\n\r\n “Is this an existing account?”\r\n\r\n “No.  I want you to open it with the wire.”\r\n\r\n “Very well.  The second transfer?”\r\n\r\n “One million dollars to the Dane County Bank in Danesboro, Kentucky, to any account in the name of Harold or Maxine Sutherland, or both.  It’s a small bank, but it has a correspondent relationship with United Kentucky in Louisville.”\r\n\r\n “Very well.  The third transfer?”\r\n\r\n “Seven million to the Deutschebank in Zurich.  Account number 772-03BL-600.  The remainder of the money stays here.”\r\n\r\n “This will take about an hour,” Laycook said as he wrote.\r\n\r\n “I’ll call you in an hour to confirm.”\r\n\r\n “Very well.”\r\n\r\n “Thank you, Mr. Laycook.”\r\n\r\n Each step was painful, but the pain was not felt.  He moved in a controlled jog down the escalators and out of the building.\r\n\r\n On the top floor of the Royal Bank of Montreal, Grand Cayman branch, a secretary from Wire Transfers slid a computer printout under the very pointed and proper nose of Randolph Osgood.  She had circled an unusual transfer of ten million.  Unusual because the money in this account did not normally return to the United States and unusual because it went to a bank they had, never dealt with.  Osgood studied the printout and called Memphis.  Mr. Tolar was on leave of absence, the secretary informed him.  Then Nathan Locke?  he asked.  Mr. Locke is out of town.  Victor Milligan?  Mr. Milligan is away also.\r\n\r\n Osgood placed the printout in the pile of things to do tomorrow.\r\n * * * \r\n Along the Emerald Coast of Florida and Alabama, from the outskirts of Mobile east through Pensacola, Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Panama City, the warm spring night had been peaceful.  Only one violent crime along the coast.  A young woman was robbed, beaten and raped in her room at the Perdido Beach Hilton.  Her boyfriend, a tall blond-headed man with strong Nordic features, had found her bound and gagged in her room.  His name was Rimmer, Aaron Rimmer, and he was from Memphis.\r\n\r\n The real excitement of the night was a massive manhunt in the Mobile area for the escaped murderer, Ray McDeere.  He had been seen arriving at the bus station after dark.  His mug shot was on the front page of the morning paper, and before ten, three witnesses had come forth and reported sightings.  His movements were traced across Mobile Bay to Foley, Alabama, then to Gulf Shores.\r\n\r\n Since the Hilton is only ten miles from Gulf Shores along Highway 182, and since the only known escaped murderer was in the vicinity when the only violent crime occurred, the conclusion was quick and inescapable.  The hotel’s night clerk made a probable ID of Ray McDeere, and the records reflected that he checked in around nine-thirty as a Mr. Lee\r\n\r\n Stevens.  And he paid cash.  Later, the victim checked in and was attacked.  The victim also identified Mr. Ray McDeere. "

        "text":"Energy Consumption Analytics for a Product Resource Management Company \r\n\r\n Business Problem \r\n\r\n Our client specializes in product resource management software to help manufacturers manage their energy and resource costs without installing smart meters or conducting regular energy audits.  The client wanted to use historical machine level production outputs to accurately estimate energy resource required per machine and subsequently take corrective action to reduce energy inefficiencies within their production processes. \r\n\r\n Challenge \r\n One of the challenges was to work with sparse facility output data to identify the right relationships and not over-parameterize or over-fit the model.  Also, the energy consumption at production facilities depends not only on the operating machines, but also on sev-eral other undocumented sources of energy consumption such as HVAC.  Additionally, we observed temporal relationships between the machines that are generally difficult to capture using sparse data. \r\n Solution \r\n Tiger Analytics worked with the client to understand the available data in the context of the business problem.  We explored the non-linear and temporal relationships of resource consumption with run times and production outputs of various machines. \r\n\r\n Our initial analysis revealed that the relationship between electricity consumption and production for a given machine had a fixed and variable component, both of which needed to be successfully captured by our model.  Through systematic analyses using training and test datasets, we identified the right model forms, and computed the confidence around our estimates for various machines.  We used bootstrapping to analyze sensitivity of end-results and assumptions, and refined the algorithms, thus ensuring their robustness. \r\n\r\n We developed predictive models to help our client identify opportunity areas to reduce their energy resource consumption and carbon footprint across their production facilities. \r\n Impact \r\n Our model predicted the overall energy consumption of the production facilities with up to 97% accuracy.  In addition, we identified areas where energy efficiency could be gained by modifying the production schedule.  This work led to significant impact to the bottom-line of our client’s customers. \r\n About Tiger Analytics \r\n We are a boutique analytical consulting firm.  We use advanced analytical techniques, business insights and data engineering to make data-driven decisions and solve complex business problems. \r\n Contact details: info@tigeranalytics.com \r\n +1-408- 508-4430 \r\n For more information visit: www.tigeranalytics.com"

        "text":"Prof: Good morning.  Ready to begin?  Today I'd like to complement our study of Romanticism by examining more closely the life of Charles Fourier.  That's four like the number, then i-e-r.  But, before we study Mr. Fourier, let's review what we know about Romanticism.  Who can tell me what Romanticism was, and when it lasted?  Yes, Mr. Stiles.\r\n\r\n S: Romanticism was a cultural and, um, artistic movement in Europe.  It lasted for the first quarter of the 18th - no, I mean 19th — Century.\r\n\r\n P: Very nice, Mr. Stiles.  Who would like to summarize the main message of Romanticism?  Let's see...Mr.  Brown?\r\n\r\n S: The main message was probably, um, that artists should, uh, that individuals should, use their imagination to choose the form and content of all art.  The Romantics thought that the Enlightenment had kind of choked off imagination, and feeling, and creativity, and, um, like stifled all individual freedom.\r\n\r\n P: Well put, Mr. Brown.  The Romantics loathed any type of rationalism.  The Enlightenment had emphasized rationality and reason so much that the Romantics felt the individual had been demolished, reduced to an automated robot.  It was time to liberate the soul, to break away and stand out, to reclaim individual freedom.  Rousseau penned the rallying cry in the beginning of his Confessions: \"...I am not made like any of those I have seen.  I venture to believe that I am not made like any of those who are in existence.  If I am not better, at least I am different.\"\r\n\r\n So then, it was against this backdrop that Charles Fourier appeared on the historical stage.  Mr. Fourier was what Karl Marx would later dub a utopian socialist.  He was one of three main utopian socialists, along with Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon.  A utopian socialist, broadly speaking, was someone who employed socialist principles to create hypothetical versions of perfect utopias - um, societies that were egalitarian or communal, in which people would live in perfect fairness and harmony.  Utopian philosophers believed these kinds of societies could be achieved in the immediate future.  They thus planted the first seeds of the early 20th Century socialist movement.\r\n\r\n Monsieur Fourier was born in northeast France on April 7, 1772, and he died in Paris on October 10, 1837.  He was widely regarded as the most utopian of the utopian socialists.  He argued vigorously, for instance, that women should have equal rights with men - and actually coined our modern word feminism.  Also, he thought the industrial revolution that was then taking place in England was simply a passing phase;  that mankind would move beyond industrialism to something better.  As to what that something better would be, Fourier had some rather unusual ideas.  He was born into a well-to-do family of cloth merchants, and after he inherited his mother's estate in 1812, he had the money - and time - to pursue these notions.  In his four published works, Fourier laid out a vision of a future community built on emotional bonds, fueled by what he called the laws of \"passional attraction.\"  Basic human passions and drives had been repressed for too long, he argued.  Now these emotions needed to be openly expressed and harnessed.  Men and women would live in self-contained housing units with 1,620 members.  Why 1,620?  Because Mr. Fourier had determined that people could be classified into 810 different psychological types.  If you multiply this by two, for men and women, you get 1,620.  With such precise pairing, he was certain that the laws of passional attraction would produce ideal, harmonious relationships.\r\n\r\n Many of Fourier's ideas, to be frank, were perfect nonsense.  He projected that his new world would last for 80,000 years, the last 8,000 of these in an era of perfect harmony.  In this period he predicted, among other things, that six moons would orbit the earth, and the seas would become oceans of lemonade (laughter).  But sprinkled amidst his nonsense were enough kernels of fresh thought to qualify Fourier as an instrumental influence on later socialist thinkers, such as Marx and Engels.  Many think the most valuable of these kernels was Fourier's idea that work, especially heavy manual labor, could be turned into play: something deeply satisfying both mentally and physically.  That was probably the one vision of Fourier's that most captivated later socialist thinkers."
