        "text":"of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and\r\n receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.\r\n\r\n But gradually, as morality grows bolder, the claim of the ideal world\r\n begins to be felt;  and worship, if it is not to cease, must be given\r\n to gods of another kind than those created by the savage.  Some, though\r\n they feel the demands of the ideal, will still consciously reject\r\n them, still urging that naked Power is worthy of worship.  Such is the\r\n attitude inculcated in God's answer to Job out of the whirlwind: the\r\n divine power and knowledge are paraded, but of the divine goodness\r\n there is no hint.  Such also is the attitude of those who, in our own\r\n day, base their morality upon the struggle for survival, maintaining\r\n that the survivors are necessarily the fittest.  But others, not\r\n content with an answer so repugnant to the moral sense, will adopt the\r\n position which we have become accustomed to regard as specially\r\n religious, maintaining that, in some hidden manner, the world of fact\r\n is really harmonious with the world of ideals.  Thus Man creates God,\r\nall-powerful and all-good, the mystic unity of what is and what should\r\n be.\r\n\r\n But the world of fact, after all, is not good;  and, in submitting our\r\n judgment to it, there is an element of slavishness from which our\r\n thoughts must be purged.  For in all things it is well to exalt the\r\n dignity of Man, by freeing him as far as possible from the tyranny of\r\n non-human Power.  When we have realised that Power is largely bad, that\r\n man, with his knowledge of good and evil, is but a helpless atom in a\r\n world which has no such knowledge, the choice is again presented to\r\n us: Shall we worship Force, or shall we worship Goodness?  Shall our\r\n God exist and be evil, or shall he be recognised as the creation of\r\n our own conscience?\r\n\r\n The answer to this question is very momentous, and affects profoundly\r\n our whole morality.  The worship of Force, to which Carlyle and\r\n Nietzsche and the creed of Militarism have accustomed us, is the\r\n result of failure to maintain our own ideals against a hostile\r\n universe: it is itself a prostrate submission to evil, a sacrifice of\r\n our best to Moloch.  If strength indeed is to be respected, let us\r\n respect rather the strength of those who refuse that false\r\n \"recognition of facts\" which fails to recognise that facts are often\r\n bad.  Let us admit that, in the world we know, there are many things\r\n that would be better otherwise, and that the ideals to which we do and\r\n must adhere are not realised in the realm of matter.  Let us preserve\r\n our respect for truth, for beauty, for the ideal of perfection which\r\n life does not permit us to attain, though none of these things meet\r\n with the approval of the unconscious universe.  If Power is bad, as it\r\n seems to be, let us reject it from our hearts.  In this lies Man's true\r\n freedom: in determination to worship only the God created by our own\r\n love of the good, to respect only the heaven which inspires the\r\n insight of our best moments.  In action, in desire, we must submit\r\n perpetually to the tyranny of outside forces;  but in thought, in\r\n aspiration, we are free, free from our fellow-men, free from the petty\r\n planet on which our bodies impotently crawl, free even, while we live,\r\nfrom the tyranny of death.  Let us learn, then, that energy of faith\r\n which enables us to live constantly in the vision of the good;  and let\r\n us descend, in action, into the world of fact, with that vision always\r\n before us.\r\n\r\n When first the opposition of fact and ideal grows fully visible, a\r\n spirit of fiery revolt, of fierce hatred of the gods, seems necessary\r\n to the assertion of freedom.  To defy with Promethean constancy a\r\n hostile universe, to keep its evil always in view, always actively\r\n hated, to refuse no pain that the malice of Power can invent, appears\r\n to be the duty of all who will not bow before the inevitable.  But\r\n indignation is still a bondage, for it compels our thoughts to be\r\n occupied with an evil world;  and in the fierceness of desire from\r\n which rebellion springs there is a kind of self-assertion which it is\r\n necessary for the wise to overcome.  Indignation is a submission of our\r\n thoughts, but not of our desires;  the Stoic freedom in which wisdom\r\n consists is found in the submission of our desires, but not of our\r\n thoughts.  From the submission of our desires springs the virtue of\r\n resignation;  from the freedom of our thoughts springs the whole world\r\n of art and philosophy, and the vision of beauty by which, at last, we\r\n half reconquer the reluctant world.  But the vision of beauty is\r\n possible only to unfettered contemplation, to thoughts not weighted by\r\n the load of eager wishes;  and thus Freedom comes only to those who no\r\n longer ask of life that it shall yield them any of those personal\r\n goods that are subject to the mutations of Time.\r\n\r\n Although the necessity of renunciation is evidence of the existence of\r\n evil, yet Christianity, in preaching it, has shown a wisdom exceeding\r\n that of the Promethean philosophy of rebellion.  It must be admitted\r\n that, of the things we desire, some, though they prove impossible, are\r\n yet real goods;  others, however, as ardently longed for, do not form\r\n part of a fully purified ideal.  The belief that what must be renounced\r\n is bad, though sometimes false, is far less often false than untamed\r\n passion supposes;  and the creed of religion, by providing a reason\r\n for proving that it is never false, has been the means of purifying\r\n our hopes by the discovery of many austere truths.\r\n\r\n But there is in resignation a further good element: even real goods,\r\nwhen they are unattainable, ought not to be fretfully desired.  To\r\n every man comes, sooner or later, the great renunciation.  For the\r\n young, there is nothing unattainable;  a good thing desired with the\r\n whole force of a passionate will, and yet impossible, is to them not\r\n credible.  Yet, by death, by illness, by poverty, or by the voice of\r\n duty, we must learn, each one of us, that the world was not made for\r\n us, and that, however beautiful may be the things we crave, Fate may\r\n nevertheless forbid them.  It is the part of courage, when misfortune\r\n comes, to bear without repining the ruin of our hopes, to turn away\r\n our thoughts from vain regrets.

        "text":"world about us, and an inspiration by which to fashion to our needs\r\n whatever is not incapable of serving as a stone in the sacred temple.\r\n\r\n Except for those rare spirits that are born without sin, there is a\r\n cavern of darkness to be traversed before that temple can be entered.\r\n The gate of the cavern is despair, and its floor is paved with the\r\n gravestones of abandoned hopes.  There Self must die;  there the\r\n eagerness, the greed of untamed desire must be slain, for only so can\r\n the soul be freed from the empire of Fate.  But out of the cavern the\r\n Gate of Renunciation leads again to the daylight of wisdom, by whose\r\n radiance a new insight, a new joy, a new tenderness, shine forth to\r\n gladden the pilgrim's heart.\r\n\r\n When, without the bitterness of impotent rebellion, we have learnt\r\n both to resign ourselves to the outward rule of Fate and to recognise\r\n that the non-human world is unworthy of our worship, it becomes\r\n possible at last so to transform and refashion the unconscious\r\n universe, so to transmute it in the crucible of imagination, that a\r\n new image of shining gold replaces the old idol of clay.  In all the\r\n multiform facts of the world—in the visual shapes of trees and\r\n mountains and clouds, in the events of the life of man, even in the\r\n very omnipotence of Death—the insight of creative idealism can find\r\n the reflection of a beauty which its own thoughts first made.  In this\r\n way mind asserts its subtle mastery over the thoughtless forces of\r\n Nature.  The more evil the material with which it deals, the more\r\n thwarting to untrained desire, the greater is its achievement in\r\n inducing the reluctant rock to yield up its hidden treasures, the\r\n prouder its victory in compelling the opposing forces to swell the\r\n pageant of its triumph.  Of all the arts, Tragedy is the proudest, the\r\n most triumphant;  for it builds its shining citadel in the very centre\r\n of the enemy's country, on the very summit of his highest mountain;\r\n from its impregnable watchtowers, his camps and arsenals, his columns\r\n and forts, are all revealed;  within its walls the free life continues,\r\nwhile the legions of Death and Pain and Despair, and all the servile\r\n captains of tyrant Fate, afford the burghers of that dauntless city\r\n new spectacles of beauty.  Happy those sacred ramparts, thrice happy\r\n the dwellers on that all-seeing eminence.  Honour to those brave\r\n warriors who, through countless ages of warfare, have preserved for us\r\n the priceless heritage of liberty, and have kept undefiled by\r\n sacrilegious invaders the home of the unsubdued.\r\n\r\n But the beauty of Tragedy does but make visible a quality which, in\r\n more or less obvious shapes, is present always and everywhere in life.\r\n In the spectacle of Death, in the endurance of intolerable pain, and\r\n in the irrevocableness of a vanished past, there is a sacredness, an\r\n overpowering awe, a feeling of the vastness, the depth, the\r\n inexhaustible mystery of existence, in which, as by some strange\r\n marriage of pain, the sufferer is bound to the world by bonds of\r\n sorrow.  In these moments of insight, we lose all eagerness of\r\n temporary desire, all struggling and striving for petty ends, all care\r\n for the little trivial things that, to a superficial view, make up the\r\n common life of day by day;  we see, surrounding the narrow raft\r\n illumined by the flickering light of human comradeship, the dark ocean\r\n on whose rolling waves we toss for a brief hour;  from the great night\r\n without, a chill blast breaks in upon our refuge;  all the loneliness\r\n of humanity amid hostile forces is concentrated upon the individual\r\n soul, which must struggle alone, with what of courage it can command,\r\nagainst the whole weight of a universe that cares nothing for its\r\n hopes and fears.  Victory, in this struggle with the powers of\r\n darkness, is the true baptism into the glorious company of heroes, the\r\n true initiation into the overmastering beauty of human existence.  From\r\n that awful encounter of the soul with the outer world, renunciation,\r\nwisdom, and charity are born;  and with their birth a new life begins.\r\n To take into the inmost shrine of the soul the irresistible forces\r\n whose puppets we seem to be—Death and change, the irrevocableness of\r\n the past, and the powerlessness of man before the blind hurry of the\r\n universe from vanity to vanity—to feel these things and know them is\r\n to conquer them.\r\n\r\n This is the reason why the Past has such magical power.  The beauty of\r\n its motionless and silent pictures is like the enchanted purity of\r\n late autumn, when the leaves, though one breath would make them fall,\r\nstill glow against the sky in golden glory.  The Past does not change\r\n or strive;  like Duncan, after life's fitful fever it sleeps well;  what\r\n was eager and grasping, what was petty and transitory, has faded away,\r\nthe things that were beautiful and eternal shine out of it like stars\r\n in the night.  Its beauty, to a soul not worthy of it, is unendurable;\r\n but to a soul which has conquered Fate it is the key of religion.\r\n\r\n The life of Man, viewed outwardly, is but a small thing in comparison\r\n with the forces of Nature.  The slave is doomed to worship Time and\r\n Fate and Death, because they are greater than anything he finds in\r\n himself, and because all his thoughts are of things which they devour.\r\n But, great as they are, to think of them greatly, to feel their\r\n passionless splendour, is greater still.  And such thought makes us\r\n free men;  we no longer bow before the inevitable in Oriental\r\n subjection, but we absorb it, and make it a part of ourselves.  To\r\n abandon the struggle for private happiness, to expel all eagerness of\r\n temporary desire, to burn with passion for eternal things—this is\r\n emancipation, and this is the free man's worship.  And this liberation\r\n is effected by a contemplation of Fate;  for Fate itself is subdued by\r\n the mind which leaves nothing to be purged by the purifying fire of\r\n Time.\r\n\r\n United with his fellow-men by the strongest of all ties, the tie of a\r\n common doom, the free man finds that a new vision is with him always,\r\nshedding over every daily task the light of love.  The life of Man is a\r\n long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured\r\n by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and\r\n where none may tarry long.  One by one, as they march, our comrades\r\n vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent\r\n Death.  Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which\r\n their happiness or misery is decided.  Be it ours to shed sunshine on\r\n their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give\r\n them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing\r\n courage, to instil faith in hours of despair.  Let us not weigh in\r\n grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of\r\n their need—of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses,\r\nthat make the misery of their lives;  let us remember that they are\r\n fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy with\r\n ourselves.  And so, when their day is over, when their good and their\r\n evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to\r\n feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was\r\n the cause;  but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their\r\n hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave\r\n words in which high courage glowed.\r\n\r\n Brief and powerless is Man's life;  on him and all his race the slow,\r\nsure doom falls pitiless and dark.  Blind to good and evil, reckless of\r\n destruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way;  for Man,\r\ncondemned to-day to lose his dearest, to-morrow himself to pass\r\n through the gate of darkness, it remains only to cherish, ere yet the\r\n blow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble his little day;  disdaining\r\n the coward terrors of the slave of Fate, to worship at the shrine that\r\n his own hands have built;  undismayed by the empire of chance, to\r\n preserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules his outward\r\n life;  proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate, for a\r\n moment, his knowledge and his condemnation, to sustain alone, a weary\r\n but unyielding Atlas, the world that his own ideals have fashioned\r\n despite the trampling march of unconscious power.\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Reprinted from the _Independent Review_, December, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n IV\r\n\r\n THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\n\r\n In regard to every form of human activity it is necessary that the\r\n question should be asked from time to time, What is its purpose and\r\n ideal?  In what way does it contribute to the beauty of human\r\n existence?  As respects those pursuits which contribute only remotely,\r\nby providing the mechanism of life, it is well to be reminded that not\r\n the mere fact of living is to be desired, but the art of living in the\r\n contemplation of great things.  Still more in regard to those\r\n avocations which have no end outside themselves, which are to be\r\n justified, if at all, as actually adding to the sum of the world's\r\n permanent possessions, it is necessary to keep alive a knowledge of\r\n their aims, a clear prefiguring vision of the temple in which creative\r\n imagination is to be embodied.\r\n\r\n The fulfilment of this need, in what concerns the studies forming the\r\n material upon which custom has decided to train the youthful mind, is\r\n indeed sadly remote—so remote as to make the mere statement of such a\r\n claim appear preposterous.  Great men, fully alive to the beauty of the\r\n contemplations to whose service their lives are devoted, desiring that\r\n others may share in their joys, persuade mankind to impart to the\r\n successive generations the mechanical knowledge without which it is\r\n impossible to cross the threshold.  Dry pedants possess themselves of\r\n the privilege of instilling this knowledge: they forget that it is to\r\n serve but as a key to open the doors of the temple;  though they spend\r\n their lives on the steps leading up to those sacred doors, they turn\r\n their backs upon the temple so resolutely that its very existence is\r\n forgotten, and the eager youth, who would press forward to be\r\n initiated to its domes and arches, is bidden to turn back and count\r\n the steps.\r\n\r\n Mathematics, perhaps more even than the study of Greece and Rome, has\r\n suffered from this oblivion of its due place in civilisation.  Although\r\n tradition has decreed that the great bulk of educated men shall know\r\n at least the elements of the subject, the reasons for which the\r\n tradition arose are forgotten, buried beneath a great rubbish-heap of\r\n"

        "text":"When is a plant considered a weed?  Experts at Penn State University have a simple answer: When its undesirable qualities outweigh its good qualities.  Consider the fact that crops generally produce several hundred seeds from each plant.  But each weed plant can produce tens or even hundreds of thousands of seeds.  And some buried seeds can survive up to 40 years - or even longer.  Eradicating weeds means that you have to remove all the seeds and roots so the plants will not grow back.  But birds or the wind can reintroduce them to the land.  A more common way to deal with weeds is to control them enough so that the land can be used for planting.  Experts advise using two or more control methods to deal with weeds.  Chemical weed killers or natural treatments like corn gluten can suppress weed growth.  Dense planting of a crop can also act as a natural control.  Bill Curran is a professor of weed science at Penn State, in University Park, Pennsylvania.  He says one of the most common methods for suppressing weeds is dense planting.  He says a dense, competitive crop that quickly shades the soil will help suppress many weeds.  The seeds need light to grow, so blocking the sun will reduce weed growth.  Other controls include turning over the soil, pulling the weeds or covering them with mulch made of shredded wood, garden waste or other material.  But even mulch has its limits.  Natural resource specialists point out that weeds can be transported in mulch.  This is also true of soil, grain, hay and animals.  Yet animals like sheep or goats eat weeds, so they can provide a biological control.  Insects and other organisms can also act as biological controls.  Preventing the spread of weeds is an important part of weed management.  Farm vehicles should be kept out of areas with weeds.  If that is not possible, then clean off the equipment and your shoes when leaving.  Some people burn weeds or bury them deeply or make them into mulch.  Professor Curran says another way to make use of weeds is to compost them.  Heat is produced in the process of making organically rich compost to improve soil.  The heat will kill many, though not all, weed seeds.  The same is true for seeds that pass through animals that graze on weeds. \r\n Tell us about your own fight against weeds.

        "text":" like a story subordinated to some moral which it is meant to teach:\r\nfor æsthetic perfection no part of the whole should be merely a means.\r\n A certain practical spirit, a desire for rapid progress, for conquest\r\n of new realms, is responsible for the undue emphasis upon results\r\n which prevails in mathematical instruction.  The better way is to\r\n propose some theme for consideration—in geometry, a figure having\r\n important properties;  in analysis, a function of which the study is\r\n illuminating, and so on.  Whenever proofs depend upon some only of the\r\n marks by which we define the object to be studied, these marks should\r\n be isolated and investigated on their own account.  For it is a defect,\r\nin an argument, to employ more premisses than the conclusion demands:\r\nwhat mathematicians call elegance results from employing only the\r\n essential principles in virtue of which the thesis is true.  It is a\r\n merit in Euclid that he advances as far as he is able to go without\r\n employing the axiom of parallels—not, as is often said, because this\r\n axiom is inherently objectionable, but because, in mathematics, every\r\n new axiom diminishes the generality of the resulting theorems, and the\r\n greatest possible generality is before all things to be sought.\r\n\r\n Of the effects of mathematics outside its own sphere more has been\r\n written than on the subject of its own proper ideal.  The effect upon\r\n philosophy has, in the past, been most notable, but most varied;  in\r\n the seventeenth century, idealism and rationalism, in the eighteenth,\r\nmaterialism and sensationalism, seemed equally its offspring.  Of the\r\n effect which it is likely to have in the future it would be very rash\r\n to say much;  but in one respect a good result appears probable.\r\n Against that kind of scepticism which abandons the pursuit of ideals\r\n because the road is arduous and the goal not certainly attainable,\r\nmathematics, within its own sphere, is a complete answer.  Too often it\r\n is said that there is no absolute truth, but only opinion and private\r\n judgment;  that each of us is conditioned, in his view of the world, by\r\n his own peculiarities, his own taste and bias;  that there is no\r\n external kingdom of truth to which, by patience and discipline, we may\r\n at last obtain admittance, but only truth for me, for you, for every\r\n separate person.  By this habit of mind one of the chief ends of human\r\n effort is denied, and the supreme virtue of candour, of fearless\r\n acknowledgment of what is, disappears from our moral vision.  Of such\r\n scepticism mathematics is a perpetual reproof;  for its edifice of\r\n truths stands unshakable and inexpungable to all the weapons of\r\n doubting cynicism.\r\n\r\n The effects of mathematics upon practical life, though they should not\r\n be regarded as the motive of our studies, may be used to answer a\r\n doubt to which the solitary student must always be liable.  In a world\r\n so full of evil and suffering, retirement into the cloister of\r\n contemplation, to the enjoyment of delights which, however noble, must\r\n always be for the few only, cannot but appear as a somewhat selfish\r\n refusal to share the burden imposed upon others by accidents in which\r\n justice plays no part.  Have any of us the right, we ask, to withdraw\r\n from present evils, to leave our fellow-men unaided, while we live a\r\n life which, though arduous and austere, is yet plainly good in its own\r\n nature?  When these questions arise, the true answer is, no doubt, that\r\n some must keep alive the sacred fire, some must preserve, in every\r\n generation, the haunting vision which shadows forth the goal of so\r\n much striving.  But when, as must sometimes occur, this answer seems\r\n too cold, when we are almost maddened by the spectacle of sorrows to\r\n which we bring no help, then we may reflect that indirectly the\r\n mathematician often does more for human happiness than any of his more\r\n practically active contemporaries.  The history of science abundantly\r\n proves that a body of abstract propositions—even if, as in the case\r\n of conic sections, it remains two thousand years without effect upon\r\n daily life—may yet, at any moment, be used to cause a revolution in\r\n the habitual thoughts and occupations of every citizen.  The use of\r\n steam and electricity—to take striking instances—is rendered\r\n possible only by mathematics.  In the results of abstract thought the\r\n world possesses a capital of which the employment in enriching the\r\n common round has no hitherto discoverable limits.  Nor does experience\r\n give any means of deciding what parts of mathematics will be found\r\n useful.  Utility, therefore, can be only a consolation in moments of\r\n discouragement, not a guide in directing our studies.\r\n\r\n For the health of the moral life, for ennobling the tone of an age or\r\n a nation, the austerer virtues have a strange power, exceeding the\r\n power of those not informed and purified by thought.  Of these austerer\r\n virtues the love of truth is the chief, and in mathematics, more than\r\n elsewhere, the love of truth may find encouragement for waning faith.\r\n Every great study is not only an end in itself, but also a means of\r\n creating and sustaining a lofty habit of mind;  and this purpose should\r\n be kept always in view throughout the teaching and learning of\r\n mathematics.\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] This passage was pointed out to me by Professor Gilbert Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n V\r\n\r\n MATHEMATICS AND THE METAPHYSICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\n The nineteenth century, which prided itself upon the invention of\r\n steam and evolution, might have derived a more legitimate title to\r\n fame from the discovery of pure mathematics.  This science, like most\r\n others, was baptised long before it was born;  and thus we find writers\r\n before the nineteenth century alluding to what they called pure\r\n mathematics.  But if they had been asked what this subject was, they\r\n would only have been able to say that it consisted of Arithmetic,\r\nAlgebra, Geometry, and so on.  As to what these studies had in common,\r\nand as to what distinguished them from applied mathematics, our\r\n ancestors were completely in the dark.\r\n\r\n Pure mathematics was discovered by Boole, in a work which he called\r\n the _Laws of Thought_ (1854).  This work abounds in asseverations that\r\n it is not mathematical, the fact being that Boole was too modest to\r\n suppose his book the first ever written on mathematics.  He was also\r\n mistaken in supposing that he was dealing with the laws of thought:\r\nthe question how people actually think was quite irrelevant to him,\r\nand if his book had really contained the laws of thought, it was\r\n curious that no one should ever have thought in such a way before.  His\r\n book was in fact concerned with formal logic, and this is the same\r\n thing as mathematics.\r\n\r\n Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions to the effect that,\r\nif such and such a proposition is true of _anything_, then such and\r\n such another proposition is true of that thing.  It is essential not to\r\n discuss whether the first proposition is really true, and not to\r\n mention what the anything is, of which it is supposed to be true.  Both\r\n these points would belong to applied mathematics.  We start, in pure\r\n mathematics, from certain rules of inference, by which we can infer\r\n that _if_ one proposition is true, then so is some other proposition.\r\n These rules of inference constitute the major part of the principles\r\n of formal logic.  We then take any hypothesis that seems amusing, and\r\n deduce its consequences.  _If_ our hypothesis is about _anything_, and\r\n not about some one or more particular things, then our deductions\r\n constitute mathematics.  Thus mathematics may be defined as the subject\r\n in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we\r\n are saying is true.  People who have been puzzled by the beginnings of\r\n mathematics will, I hope, find comfort in this definition, and will\r\n probably agree that it is accurate.\r\n\r\n As one of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics consists in having\r\n discovered what mathematics really is, a few more words on this\r\n subject may not be amiss.  It is common to start any branch of\r\n mathematics—for instance, Geometry—with a certain number of\r\n primitive ideas, supposed incapable of definition, and a certain\r\n number of primitive propositions or axioms, supposed incapable of\r\n proof.  Now the fact is that, though there are indefinables and\r\n indemonstrables in every branch of applied mathematics, there are none\r\n in pure mathematics except such as belong to general logic.  Logic,\r\nbroadly speaking, is distinguished by the fact that its propositions\r\n can be put into a form in which they apply to anything whatever.  All\r\n pure mathematics—Arithmetic, Analysis, and Geometry—is built up by\r\n combinations of the primitive ideas of logic, and its propositions are\r\n deduced from the general axioms of logic, such as the syllogism and\r\n the other rules of inference.  And this is no longer a dream or an\r\n aspiration.  On the contrary, over the greater and more difficult part\r\n of the domain of mathematics, it has been already accomplished;  in the\r\n few remaining cases, there is no special difficulty, and it is now\r\n being rapidly achieved.  Philosophers have disputed for ages whether\r\n such deduction was possible;  mathematicians have sat down and made the\r\n deduction.  For the philosophers there is now nothing left but graceful\r\n acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n The subject of formal logic, which has thus at last shown itself to be\r\n identical with mathematics, was, as every one knows, invented by\r\n Aristotle, and formed the chief study (other than theology) of the\r\n Middle Ages.  But Aristotle never got beyond the syllogism, which is a\r\n very small part of the subject, and the schoolmen never got beyond\r\n Aristotle.  If any proof were required of our superiority to the\r\n mediæval doctors, it might be found in this.  Throughout the Middle\r\n Ages, almost all the best intellects devoted themselves to formal\r\n logic, whereas in the nineteenth century only an infinitesimal\r\n proportion of the world's thought went into this subject.\r\n Nevertheless, in each decade since 1850 more has been done to advance\r\n the subject than in the whole period from Aristotle to Leibniz.  People\r\n have discovered how to make reasoning symbolic, as it is in Algebra,\r\nso that deductions are effected by mathematical rules.  They have\r\n discovered many rules besides the syllogism, and a new branch of\r\n logic, called the Logic of Relatives,[11] has been invented to deal\r\n with topics that wholly surpassed the powers of the old logic, though\r\n they form the chief contents of mathematics.\r\n\r\n It is not easy for the lay mind to realise the importance of symbolism\r\n in discussing the foundations of mathematics, and the explanation may\r\n perhaps seem strangely paradoxical.  The fact is that symbolism is\r\n useful because it makes things difficult.  (This is not true of the\r\n advanced parts of mathematics, but only of the beginnings.)  What we\r\n wish to know is, what can be deduced from what.  Now, in the\r\n beginnings, everything is self-evident;  and it is very hard to see\r\n whether one self-evident proposition follows from another or not.\r\n Obviousness is always the enemy to correctness.  Hence we invent some\r\n new and difficult symbolism, in which nothing seems obvious.  Then we\r\n set up certain rules for operating on the symbols, and the whole thing\r\n becomes mechanical.  In this way we find out what must be taken as\r\n premiss and what can be demonstrated or defined.  For instance, the\r\n whole of Arithmetic and Algebra has been shown to require three\r\n indefinable notions and five indemonstrable propositions.  But without\r\n a symbolism it would have been very hard to find this out.  It is so\r\n obvious that two and two are four, that we can hardly make ourselves\r\n sufficiently sceptical to doubt whether it can be proved.  And the same\r\n holds in other cases where self-evident things are to be proved.\r\n\r\n But the proof of self-evident propositions may seem, to the\r\n uninitiated, a somewhat frivolous occupation.  To this we might reply\r\n that it is often by no means self-evident that one obvious proposition\r\n follows from another obvious proposition;  so that we are really\r\n discovering new truths when we prove what is evident by a method which\r\n is not evident.  But a more interesting retort is, that since people\r\n have tried to prove obvious propositions, they have found that many of\r\n them are false.  Self-evidence is often a mere will-o'-the-wisp, which\r\n is sure to lead us astray if we take it as our guide.  For instance,\r\nnothing is plainer than that a whole always has more terms than a\r\n part, or that a number is increased by adding one to it.  But these\r\n propositions are now known to be usually false.  Most numbers are\r\n infinite, and if a number is infinite you may add ones to it as long\r\n as you like without disturbing it in the least.  One of the merits of a\r\n proof is that it instils a certain doubt as to the result proved;  and\r\n when what is obvious can be proved in some cases, but not in others,\r\nit becomes possible to suppose that in these other cases it is false.\r\n\r\n The great master of the art of formal reasoning, among the men of our\r\n own day, is an Italian, Professor Peano, of the University of\r\n Turin. [12] He has reduced the greater part of mathematics (and he or\r\n his followers will, in time, have reduced the whole) to strict\r\n symbolic form, in which there are no words at all.  In the ordinary\r\n mathematical books, there are no doubt fewer words than most readers\r\n would wish.  Still, little phrases occur, such as _therefore, let us\r\n assume, consider_, or _hence it follows_.  All these, however, are a\r\n concession, and are swept away by Professor Peano.  For instance, if we\r\n wish to learn the whole of Arithmetic, Algebra, the Calculus, and\r\n indeed all that is usually called pure mathematics (except Geometry),\r\nwe must start with a dictionary of three words.  One symbol stands for\r\n _zero_, another for _number_, and a third for _next after_.  What these\r\n ideas mean, it is necessary to know if you wish to become an\r\n arithmetician.  But after symbols have been invented for these three\r\n ideas, not another word is required in the whole development.  All\r\n future symbols are symbolically explained by means of these three.\r\n Even these three can be explained by means of the notions of\r\n _relation_ and _class_;  but this requires the Logic of Relations,\r\nwhich Professor Peano has never taken up.  It must be admitted that\r\n what a mathematician has to know to begin with is not much.  There are\r\n at most a dozen notions out of which all the notions in all pure\r\n mathematics (including Geometry) are compounded.  Professor Peano, who\r\n is assisted by a very able school of young Italian disciples, has\r\n shown how this may be done;  and although the method which he has\r\n invented is capable of being carried a good deal further than he has\r\n carried it, the honour of the pioneer must belong to him.\r\n\r\n Two hundred years ago, Leibniz foresaw the science which Peano has\r\n perfected, and endeavoured to create it.  He was prevented from\r\n succeeding by respect for the authority of Aristotle, whom he could\r\n not believe guilty of definite, formal fallacies;  but the subject\r\n which he desired to create now exists, in spite of the patronising\r\n contempt with which his schemes have been treated by all superior\r\n persons.  From this \"Universal Characteristic,\" as he called it, he\r\n hoped for a solution of all problems, and an end to all disputes.  \"If\r\n controversies were to arise,\" he says, \"there would be no more need of\r\n disputation between two philosophers than between two accountants.  For\r\n it would suffice to take their pens in their hands, to sit down to\r\n their desks, and to say to each other (with a friend as witness, if\r\n they liked), 'Let us calculate.'\"  This optimism has now appeared to be\r\n somewhat excessive;  there still are problems whose solution is\r\n doubtful, and disputes which calculation cannot decide.  But over an\r\n enormous field of what was formerly controversial, Leibniz's dream has\r\n become sober fact.  In the whole philosophy of mathematics, which used\r\n to be at least as full of doubt as any other part of philosophy, order\r\n and certainty have replaced the confusion and hesitation which\r\n formerly reigned.  Philosophers, of course, have not yet discovered\r\n this fact, and continue to write on such subjects in the old way.  But\r\n mathematicians, at least in Italy, have now the power of treating the\r\n principles of mathematics in an exact and masterly manner, by means of\r\n which the certainty of mathematics extends also to mathematical\r\n philosophy.  Hence many of the topics which used to be placed among the\r\n great mysteries—for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity,\r\nof space, time and motion—are now no longer in any degree open to\r\n doubt or discussion.  Those who wish to know the nature of these things\r\n need only read the works of such men as Peano or Georg Cantor;  they\r\n will there find exact and indubitable expositions of all these quondam\r\n mysteries.\r\n\r\n In this capricious world, nothing is more capricious than posthumous\r\n fame.  One of the most notable examples of posterity's lack of judgment\r\n is the Eleatic Zeno.  This man, who may be regarded as the founder of\r\n the philosophy of infinity, appears in Plato's Parmenides in the\r\n privileged position of instructor to Socrates.  He invented four\r\n arguments, all immeasurably subtle and profound, to prove that motion\r\n is impossible, that Achilles can never overtake the tortoise, and that\r\n an arrow in flight is really at rest.  After being refuted by\r\n Aristotle, and by every subsequent philosopher from that day to our\r\n"

        "text":"own, these arguments were reinstated, and made the basis of a\r\n mathematical renaissance, by a German professor, who probably never\r\n dreamed of any connection between himself and Zeno.  Weierstrass,[13]\r\n by strictly banishing from mathematics the use of infinitesimals, has\r\n at last shown that we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow\r\n in its flight is truly at rest.  Zeno's only error lay in inferring (if\r\n he did infer) that, because there is no such thing as a state of\r\n change, therefore the world is in the same state at any one time as at\r\n any other.  This is a consequence which by no means follows;  and in\r\n this respect, the German mathematician is more constructive than the\r\n ingenious Greek.  Weierstrass has been able, by embodying his views in\r\n mathematics, where familiarity with truth eliminates the vulgar\r\n prejudices of common sense, to invest Zeno's paradoxes with the\r\n respectable air of platitudes;  and if the result is less delightful to\r\n the lover of reason than Zeno's bold defiance, it is at any rate more\r\n calculated to appease the mass of academic mankind.\r\n\r\n Zeno was concerned, as a matter of fact, with three problems, each\r\n presented by motion, but each more abstract than motion, and capable\r\n of a purely arithmetical treatment.  These are the problems of the\r\n infinitesimal, the infinite, and continuity.  To state clearly the\r\n difficulties involved, was to accomplish perhaps the hardest part of\r\n the philosopher's task.  This was done by Zeno.  From him to our own\r\n day, the finest intellects of each generation in turn attacked the\r\n problems, but achieved, broadly speaking, nothing.  In our own time,\r\nhowever, three men—Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor—have not merely\r\n advanced the three problems, but have completely solved them.  The\r\n solutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to\r\n leave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty.  This achievement is\r\n probably the greatest of which our age has to boast;  and I know of no\r\n age (except perhaps the golden age of Greece) which has a more\r\n convincing proof to offer of the transcendent genius of its great men.\r\n Of the three problems, that of the infinitesimal was solved by\r\n Weierstrass;  the solution of the other two was begun by Dedekind, and\r\n definitively accomplished by Cantor.\r\n\r\n The infinitesimal played formerly a great part in mathematics.  It was\r\n introduced by the Greeks, who regarded a circle as differing\r\n infinitesimally from a polygon with a very large number of very small\r\n equal sides.  It gradually grew in importance, until, when Leibniz\r\n invented the Infinitesimal Calculus, it seemed to become the\r\n fundamental notion of all higher mathematics.  Carlyle tells, in his\r\n _Frederick the Great_, how Leibniz used to discourse to Queen Sophia\r\n Charlotte of Prussia concerning the infinitely little, and how she\r\n would reply that on that subject she needed no instruction—the\r\n behaviour of courtiers had made her thoroughly familiar with it.  But\r\n philosophers and mathematicians—who for the most part had less\r\n acquaintance with courts—continued to discuss this topic, though\r\n without making any advance.  The Calculus required continuity, and\r\n continuity was supposed to require the infinitely little;  but nobody\r\n could discover what the infinitely little might be.  It was plainly not\r\n quite zero, because a sufficiently large number of infinitesimals,\r\nadded together, were seen to make up a finite whole.  But nobody could\r\n point out any fraction which was not zero, and yet not finite.  Thus\r\n there was a deadlock.  But at last Weierstrass discovered that the\r\n infinitesimal was not needed at all, and that everything could be\r\n accomplished without it.  Thus there was no longer any need to suppose\r\n that there was such a thing.  Nowadays, therefore, mathematicians are\r\n more dignified than Leibniz: instead of talking about the infinitely\r\n small, they talk about the infinitely great—a subject which, however\r\n appropriate to monarchs, seems, unfortunately, to interest them even\r\n less than the infinitely little interested the monarchs to whom\r\n Leibniz discoursed.\r\n\r\n The banishment of the infinitesimal has all sorts of odd consequences,\r\nto which one has to become gradually accustomed.  For example, there is\r\n no such thing as the next moment.  The interval between one moment and\r\n the next would have to be infinitesimal, since, if we take two moments\r\n with a finite interval between them, there are always other moments in\r\n the interval.  Thus if there are to be no infinitesimals, no two\r\n moments are quite consecutive, but there are always other moments\r\n between any two.  Hence there must be an infinite number of moments\r\n between any two;  because if there were a finite number one would be\r\n nearest the first of the two moments, and therefore next to it.  This\r\n might be thought to be a difficulty;  but, as a matter of fact, it is\r\n here that the philosophy of the infinite comes in, and makes all\r\n straight.\r\n\r\n The same sort of thing happens in space.  If any piece of matter be cut\r\n in two, and then each part be halved, and so on, the bits will become\r\n smaller and smaller, and can theoretically be made as small as we\r\n please.  However small they may be, they can still be cut up and made\r\n smaller still.  But they will always have _some_ finite size, however\r\n small they may be.  We never reach the infinitesimal in this way, and\r\n no finite number of divisions will bring us to points.  Nevertheless\r\n there _are_ points, only these are not to be reached by successive\r\n divisions.  Here again, the philosophy of the infinite shows us how\r\n this is possible, and why points are not infinitesimal lengths.\r\n\r\n As regards motion and change, we get similarly curious results.  People\r\n used to think that when a thing changes, it must be in a state of\r\n change, and that when a thing moves, it is in a state of motion.  This\r\n is now known to be a mistake.  When a body moves, all that can be said\r\n is that it is in one place at one time and in another at another.  We\r\n must not say that it will be in a neighbouring place at the next\r\n instant, since there is no next instant.  Philosophers often tell us\r\n that when a body is in motion, it changes its position within the\r\n instant.  To this view Zeno long ago made the fatal retort that every\r\n body always is where it is;  but a retort so simple and brief was not\r\n of the kind to which philosophers are accustomed to give weight, and\r\n they have continued down to our own day to repeat the same phrases\r\n which roused the Eleatic's destructive ardour.  It was only recently\r\n that it became possible to explain motion in detail in accordance with\r\n Zeno's platitude, and in opposition to the philosopher's paradox.  We\r\n may now at last indulge the comfortable belief that a body in motion\r\n is just as truly where it is as a body at rest.  Motion consists merely\r\n in the fact that bodies are sometimes in one place and sometimes in\r\n another, and that they are at intermediate places at intermediate\r\n times.  Only those who have waded through the quagmire of philosophic\r\n speculation on this subject can realise what a liberation from antique\r\n prejudices is involved in this simple and straightforward commonplace.\r\n\r\n The philosophy of the infinitesimal, as we have just seen, is mainly\r\n negative.  People used to believe in it, and now they have found out\r\n their mistake.  The philosophy of the infinite, on the other hand, is\r\n wholly positive.  It was formerly supposed that infinite numbers, and\r\n the mathematical infinite generally, were self-contradictory.  But as\r\n it was obvious that there were infinities—for example, the number of\r\n numbers—the contradictions of infinity seemed unavoidable, and\r\n philosophy seemed to have wandered into a \"cul-de-sac.\"  This\r\n difficulty led to Kant's antinomies, and hence, more or less\r\n indirectly, to much of Hegel's dialectic method.  Almost all current\r\n philosophy is upset by the fact (of which very few philosophers are as\r\n yet aware) that all the ancient and respectable contradictions in the\r\n notion of the infinite have been once for all disposed of.  The method\r\n by which this has been done is most interesting and instructive.  In\r\n the first place, though people had talked glibly about infinity ever\r\n since the beginnings of Greek thought, nobody had ever thought of\r\n asking, What is infinity?  If any philosopher had been asked for a\r\n definition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible\r\n rigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a\r\n definition that had any meaning at all.  Twenty years ago, roughly\r\n speaking, Dedekind and Cantor asked this question, and, what is more\r\n remarkable, they answered it.  They found, that is to say, a perfectly\r\n precise definition of an infinite number or an infinite collection of\r\n things.  This was the first and perhaps the greatest step.  It then\r\n remained to examine the supposed contradictions in this notion.  Here\r\n Cantor proceeded in the only proper way.  He took pairs of\r\n contradictory propositions, in which both sides of the contradiction\r\n would be usually regarded as demonstrable, and he strictly examined\r\n the supposed proofs.  He found that all proofs adverse to infinity\r\n involved a certain principle, at first sight obviously true, but\r\n destructive, in its consequences, of almost all mathematics.  The\r\n proofs favourable to infinity, on the other hand, involved no\r\n principle that had evil consequences.  It thus appeared that common\r\n sense had allowed itself to be taken in by a specious maxim, and that,\r\nwhen once this maxim was rejected, all went well.\r\n\r\n The maxim in question is, that if one collection is part of another,\r\nthe one which is a part has fewer terms than the one of which it is a\r\n part.  This maxim is true of finite numbers.  For example, Englishmen\r\n are only some among Europeans, and there are fewer Englishmen than\r\n Europeans.  But when we come to infinite numbers, this is no longer\r\n true.  This breakdown of the maxim gives us the precise definition of\r\n infinity.  A collection of terms is infinite when it contains as parts\r\n other collections which have just as many terms as it has.  If you can\r\n take away some of the terms of a collection, without diminishing the\r\n number of terms, then there are an infinite number of terms in the\r\n collection.  For example, there are just as many even numbers as there\r\n are numbers altogether, since every number can be doubled.  This may be\r\n seen by putting odd and even numbers together in one row, and even\r\n numbers alone in a row below:—\r\n\r\n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, _ad infinitum_.\r\n 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"My stomach knotted as I watched Tempi take another swallow of whiskey and get to his feet.  The problem was that we were strangers here.  If things got ugly, could I count on the irritated mercenaries to step in and put a stop to things?  Three against one was nothing close to a fair fight, and if it got ugly it would get ugly fast.\r\n Tempi took a mouthful of beer and looked at me calmly.  “Watch my back,” he said, then turned to walk to where the other mercenaries stood.\r\n For a moment I was simply impressed by his good use of Aturan.  Since I’d known him, he’d gone from practically mute to using idiomatic speech.  But that pride quickly faded as I tried to think of something I could do to stop the fight if things got out of control.\r\n I couldn’t think of a blessed thing.  I hadn’t seen this coming, and I had no clever tricks up my sleeve.  For lack of any better options, I drew my knife out of its sheath and held it out of sight below the level of the table.  The last thing I’d want to do is stab someone, but I could at least menace them with it and buy us enough time to get out the door.\r\n Tempi gave the three mercenaries an appraising look.  Tam was inches taller than he, with shoulders like an ox.  There was a bald fellow with a scarred face and a wicked grin.  Last was the blonde woman who stood a full hand taller than Tempi.\r\n “There is only one woman,” Tempi said, looking Tam in the eye.  “Is enough?  You may bring one more.”\r\n The female mercenary bristled.  “You swaggercock,” she spat.  “I’ll show you what a woman can do in a fight.”\r\n Tempi nodded politely.\r\n His continuing lack of concern began to relax me.  I had heard the stories, of course, a single Adem mercenary defeating a dozen regular soldiers.  Could Tempi really fight off these three at the same time?  He certainly seemed to think so. . . .\r\n Tempi looked at them.  “This is my first fight of this sort.  How does begin?”\r\n My palm started to sweat where I gripped the knife.\r\n Tam stepped up so their chests were only inches apart.  He loomed over Tempi.  “We’ll start by whipping you bloody.  Then we’ll give you a kicking.  Then we’ll come round and do it agin to make sure we didn’t miss anything.”  As he said the last, he slammed his forehead down into Tempi’s face.\r\n My breath caught in my chest, and before I could get it back, the fight was over.\r\n When the bearded mercenary snapped his head forward, I had expected to see Tempi reel backward, nose broken and gushing blood.  But Tam was the one who staggered backward, howling and clutching at his face, blood spurting from beneath his hands.\r\n Tempi stepped forward, got his hand on the back of the big man’s neck, and spun him effortlessly into the ground where he landed in a messy tangle of arms and legs.\r\n Without a hint of hesitation, Tempi turned and kicked the blonde woman squarely in the hip, making her stagger.  While she was reeling, Tempi punched her sharply in the side of the head, and she folded bonelessly to the ground.\r\n That’s when the bald man stepped in, arms spread like a wrestler.  Quick as a snake, he got one hand on Tempi’s shoulder and the other on his neck.\r\n I honestly can’t say what happened next.  There was a flurry of movement, and Tempi was left gripping the man’s wrist and shoulder.  The bald man snarled and struggled.  But Tempi simply twisted the man’s arm until he was bent over, staring at the floor.  Then Tempi kicked the man’s leg out from under him, sending him tumbling to the ground.\r\n All in less time than it takes to tell it.  If I hadn’t been so stunned, I would have burst into applause.\r\n Tam and the woman lay with the dead stillness of those deeply unconscious.  But the bald man snarled something and began to make his way unsteadily back to his feet.  Tempi stepped close, struck him in the head with casual precision, then watched the man slump limply to the ground.\r\n It was, I thought idly, the most polite punch I’d ever seen.  It was the careful blow of a skilled carpenter pounding a nail: hard enough to drive it fully home, but not so hard as to bruise the wood around it.\r\n The room was very quiet in the aftermath.  Then the tall man who had refused to fight raised his mug in salute, spilling a little.  “Good on you!”  he said loudly to Tempi, laughing.  “Nobody will think less of you if you show Tam a bit of your boot while he’s down there.  Lord knows he’s done it enough in his day.”\r\n Tempi looked down as if considering it, then shook his head and walked quietly back to our table.  All eyes were still watching him, but the looks weren’t nearly as dark as before.\r\n Tempi came back to the table.  “Did you watch my back?”\r\n I looked up at him blankly, then nodded.\r\n “What did you see?”\r\n Only then did I understand what he really meant.  “Your back was very straight.”\r\n Approval.  “Your back is not straight.”  He held up a flat hand, tilted to one side.  “That is why you stumble in the Ketan.  It is . .  .”  Looking down, he trailed off, having noticed my knife half-concealed in my tatty cloak.  He frowned.  Actually frowned with his face.  It was the first time I’d seen him do it, and it was amazingly intimidating.\r\n “We will speak on this later,” he said.  At his side, he gestured: Vast disapproval.\r\n Feeling more chastised than if I’d spent an hour on the horns, I ducked my head and put the knife away.\r\n\r\n We had been walking quietly for hours, our packs heavy with supplies, when Tempi finally spoke.  “There is a thing I must teach you.”  Serious.\r\n “I am always glad to learn,” I said, making the gesture I hoped meant earnest.\r\n Tempi walked to the side of the road, set down his heavy pack, and sat on the grass.  “We must speak of the Lethani.”\r\n It took all my control to not burst out into a sudden, giddy smile.  I had been wanting to bring up the subject for a long while, as we were much closer than when I’d first asked him.  But I hadn’t wanted to risk offending him again.\r\n I sat quietly for a moment, partly to maintain my composure, but also to let Tempi know I was treating this subject with respect.  “The Lethani,” I repeated carefully.  “You said I must not ask of it.”\r\n “You must not then.  Now perhaps.  I . .  .”  Uncertain.  “I am pulled many ways.  But now asking is.”\r\n I waited for another moment to see if he would continue on his own.  When he didn’t, I asked the obvious question.  “What is the Lethani?”\r\n Serious.  Tempi looked at me for a long moment, then suddenly burst out laughing.  “I do not know.  And I cannot tell you.”  He laughed again.  Understatement.  “Still we must speak of it.”\r\n I hesitated, wondering if this was one of his strange jokes that I could never seem to understand.\r\n “Is complicated,” he said.  “Hard in my own language.  Yours?”  Frustration.  “Tell me what you know of the Lethani.”\r\n I tried to think of how I could describe what I’d heard of the Lethani using only the words he knew.  “I heard the Lethani is a secret thing that makes the Adem strong.”\r\n"

Heaven forbid that we should call them Ten Commandments  —  let us perhaps call them Ten Requests.\r\n Kato Lomb\r\n\r\n I. Spend time tinkering with the language every day  —  if there is no more time available, then at least to the extent of a ten-minute monologue.  Morning hours are especially valuable in this respect: the early bird catches the word!\r\n II.  If your enthusiasm for studying flags too quickly, don’t force the issue but don’t stop altogether either.  Move to some other form of studying, e.g., instead of reading, listen to the radio;  instead of assignment writing, poke about in the dictionary, etc.\r\n\r\n III.  Never learn isolated units of speech, but rather learn words and grammatical elements in context.\r\n\r\n IV.  Write phrases in the margins of your text and use them as ‘prefabricated elements’ in your conversations.\r\n\r\n V.  Even a tired brain finds rest and relaxation in quick, impromptu translations of billboard advertisements flashing by, of numbers over doorways, of snippets of overheard conversations, etc., just for its own amusement.\r\n\r\n VI.  Memorize only that which has been corrected by a teacher.  Do not keep reading texts you have written that have not been proofread and corrected so as to keep mistakes from taking root in your mind.  If you study on your own, each segment to be memorized should be kept to a size that precludes the possibility of errors.\r\n\r\n VII.  Always memorize idiomatic expressions in the first person singular.  For example, ‘I am only pulling your leg.’  Or else: ‘Il m’a pose un lapin’  —  ‘He stood me up.’\r\n\r\n VIII.  A foreign language is a castle.  It is advisable to attack it on all fronts at once: via newspapers, the radio, un-dubbed movies, technical or scientific articles, textbooks, or via a visitor at your neighbor’s.\r\n IX.  Do not let the fear of making mistakes keep you from speaking, but do ask your conversation partner to correct you.  Most importantly, don’t get peeved if he or she actually obliges you  —  a remote possibility, anyway.\r\n X. Be firmly convinced that you are a linguistic genius.  If the facts demonstrate otherwise, heap blame on the pesky language you aim to master, on the dictionaries, or on this little book, not on yourself.”"

        "text":"Supposons, en effet, que la\r\n réalité première soit de nature neutre, et appelons-la par quelque nom\r\n encore ambigu, comme _phénomène_, _donné_, _Vorfindung_.  Moi-même j'en\r\n parle volontiers au pluriel, et je lui donne le nom d'_expériences\r\n pures_.  Ce sera un monisme, si vous voulez, mais un monisme tout à fait\r\n rudimentaire et absolument opposé au soi-disant monisme bilatéral du\r\n positivisme scientifique ou spinoziste.\r\n\r\n Ces expériences pures existent et se succèdent, entrent dans des\r\n rapports infiniment variés les unes avec les autres, rapports qui sont\r\n eux-mêmes des parties essentielles de la trame des expériences.  Il y a\r\n \"Conscience\" de ces rapports au même titre qu'il y a \"Conscience\" de\r\n leurs termes.  Il en résulte que des _groupes_ d'expériences se font\r\n remarquer et distinguer, et qu'une seule et même expérience, vu la\r\n grande variété de ses rapports, peut jouer un rôle dans plusieurs\r\n groupes à la fois.  C'est ainsi que dans un certain contexte de voisins,\r\nelle serait classée comme un phénomène physique, tandis que dans un\r\n autre entourage elle figurerait comme un fait de conscience, à peu près\r\n comme une même particule d'encre peut appartenir simultanément à deux\r\n lignes, l'une verticale, l'autre horizontale, pourvu qu'elle soit située\r\n à leur intersection.\r\n\r\n Prenons, pour fixer nos idées, l'expérience que nous avons à ce moment\r\n du local où nous sommes, de ces murailles, de cette table, de ces\r\n chaises, de cet espace.  Dans cette expérience pleine, concrète et\r\n indivise, telle qu'elle est là, donnée, le monde physique objectif et le\r\n monde intérieur et personnel de chacun de nous se rencontrent et se\r\n fusionnent comme des lignes se fusionnent à leur intersection.  Comme\r\n chose physique, cette salle a des rapports avec tout le reste du\r\n bâtiment, bâtiment que nous autres nous ne connaissons et ne connaîtrons\r\n pas.  Elle doit son existence à toute une histoire de financiers,\r\nd'architectes, d'ouvriers.  Elle pèse sur le sol;  elle durera\r\n indéfiniment dans le temps;  si le feu y éclatait, les chaises et la\r\n table qu'elle contient seraient vite réduites en cendres.\r\n\r\n Comme expérience personnelle, au contraire, comme chose \"rapportée,\"\r\n connue, consciente, cette salle a de tout autres tenants et\r\n aboutissants.  Ses antécédents ne sont pas des ouvriers, ce sont nos\r\n pensées respectives de tout à l'heure.  Bientôt elle ne figurera que\r\n comme un fait fugitif dans nos biographies, associé à d'agréables\r\n souvenirs.  Comme expérience psychique, elle n'a aucun poids, son\r\n ameublement n'est pas combustible.  Elle n'exerce de force physique que\r\n sur nos seuls cerveaux, et beaucoup d'entre nous nient encore cette\r\n influence;  tandis que la salle physique est en rapport d'influence\r\n physique avec tout le reste du monde.\r\n\r\n Et pourtant c'est de la même salle absolument qu'il s'agit dans les deux\r\n cas.  Tant que nous ne faisons pas de physique spéculative, tant que\r\n nous nous plaçons dans le sens commun, c'est la salle vue et sentie qui\r\n est bien la salle physique.  De quoi parlons-nous donc si ce n'est de\r\n _cela_, de cette même partie de la nature matérielle que tous nos\r\n esprits, à ce même moment, embrassent, qui entre telle quelle dans\r\n l'expérience actuelle et intime de chacun de nous, et que notre souvenir\r\n regardera toujours comme une partie intégrante de notre histoire.  C'est\r\n absolument une même étoffe qui figure simultanément, selon le contexte\r\n que l'on considère, comme fait matériel et physique, ou comme fait de\r\n conscience intime.\r\n\r\n Je crois donc qu'on ne saurait traiter conscience et matière comme étant\r\n d'essence disparate.  On n'obtient ni l'une ni l'autre par soustraction,\r\nen négligeant chaque fois l'autre moitié d'une expérience de composition\r\n double.  Les expériences sont au contraire primitivement de nature plutôt\r\n simple.  Elles _deviennent_ conscientes dans leur entier, elles\r\n _deviennent_ physiques dans leur entier;  et c'est _par voie d'addition_\r\n que ce résultat se réalise.  Pour autant que des expériences se\r\n prolongent dans le temps, entrent dans des rapports d'influence\r\n physique, se brisant, se chauffant, s'éclairant, etc., mutuellement,\r\nnous en faisons un groupe à part que nous appelons le monde physique.\r\n Pour autant, au contraire, qu'elles sont fugitives, inertes\r\n physiquement, que leur succession ne suit pas d'ordre déterminé, mais\r\n semble plutôt obéir à des caprices émotifs, nous en faisons un autre\r\n groupe que nous appelons le monde psychique.  C'est en entrant à présent\r\n dans un grand nombre de ces groupes psychiques que cette salle devient\r\n maintenant chose consciente, chose rapportée, chose sue.  En faisant\r\n désormais partie de nos biographies respectives, elle ne sera pas suivie\r\n de cette sotte et monotone répétition d'elle-même dans le temps qui\r\n caractérise son existence physique.  Elle sera suivie, au contraire, par\r\n d'autres expériences qui seront discontinues avec elle, ou qui auront ce\r\n genre tout particulier de continuité que nous appelons souvenir.  Demain,\r\nelle aura eu sa place dans chacun de nos passés;  mais les présents\r\n divers auxquels tous ces passés seront liés demain seront bien\r\n différents du présent dont cette salle jouira demain comme entité\r\n physique.\r\n\r\n Les deux genres de groupes sont formés d'expériences, mais les rapports\r\n des expériences entre elles diffèrent d'un groupe à l'autre.  C'est donc\r\n par addition d'autres phénomènes qu'un phénomène donné devient conscient\r\n ou connu, ce n'est pas par un dédoublement d'essence intérieure.  La\r\n connaissance des choses leur _survient_, elle ne leur est pas immanente.\r\n Ce n'est le fait ni d'un moi transcendental, ni d'une _Bewusstheit_ ou\r\n acte de conscience qui les animerait chacune.  _Elles se connaissent\r\n l'une l'autre_, ou plutôt il y en a qui connaissent les autres;  et le\r\n rapport que nous nommons connaissance n'est lui-même, dans beaucoup de\r\n cas, qu'une suite d'expériences intermédiaires parfaitement susceptibles\r\n d'être décrites en termes concrets.  Il n'est nullement le mystère\r\n transcendant où se sont complus tant de philosophes.\r\n\r\n Mais ceci nous mènerait beaucoup trop loin.  Je ne puis entrer ici dans\r\n tous les replis de la théorie de la connaissance, ou de ce que, vous\r\n autres Italiens, vous appelez la gnoséologie.  Je dois me contenter de\r\n ces remarques écourtées, ou simples suggestions, qui sont, je le crains,\r\nencore bien obscures faute des développements nécessaires.\r\n\r\n Permettez donc que je me résume—trop sommairement, et en style\r\n dogmatique—dans les six thèses suivantes:\r\n\r\n   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n _1^o La Conscience, telle qu'on l'entend ordinairement, n'existe pas,\r\npas plus que la Matière, à laquelle Berkeley a donné le coup de grâce; _\r\n\r\n _2^o Ce qui existe et forme la part de vérité que le mot de \"Conscience\"\r\n recouvre, c'est la susceptibilité que possèdent les parties de\r\n l'expérience d'être rapportées ou connues; _\r\n\r\n"

That's why he bought the most annoying phone he could find.\r\n I'll Get It Paul English and his engineers rush to answer the customer service phone.  In part because the ringer is so irritating.\r\n\r\n Guido Vitti\r\n\r\n I'll Get It Paul English and his engineers rush to answer the customer service phone.  In part because the ringer is so irritating.\r\n 34\r\n inShare\r\n\r\n At a time when many Web companies go out of their way to make it difficult to contact them, Paul English is a customer service fanatic.  When people contact Kayak, the travel search engine English founded with Steve Hafner in 2004, English makes sure they receive personal assistance from real employees.  Given that Kayak has a staff of 100 and that millions of visitors come to the site each month to compare prices for airline tickets, hotel rooms, and rental cars, that's no small commitment.  In his spare time, English, 46, even started a website, gethuman.com,  to help consumers circumvent the Kafkaesque automated phone systems of large corporations.  English, who has founded three other businesses, including an e-commerce software company that he sold to Intuit in 1999, acts as Kayak's chief technology officer, overseeing 60 engineers and product designers in Concord, Massachusetts.  On any given day, you might find him tracking down potential hires, going for a run with his software engineers, or personally answering calls to Kayak's customer hotline.\r\n\r\n I always wake up with a lot of energy and more ideas than I can get done in a day.  I usually meditate for a few minutes to quiet my mind before I get out of bed.  I get up around 6 every morning.  After I check e-mail on my BlackBerry, I go exercise.  I've been practicing yoga for about 10 years.  I built a meditative room in my house.\r\n\r\n After that, I eat breakfast and then drive my son to school.  He's 14, and my daughter is 17 — she has her own car.  Driving my son to school is really important to me.  Sometimes, if I have a business trip, I'll drive him to school, fly to California for the day, and then take the redeye back so I can take him to school the next day.\r\n\r\n About two or three days a week, I have morning meetings — mostly with nonprofits.  I'm involved with a lot of different projects, including Partners in Health and Village Health Works in Burundi.  It sounds sappy, but there are certain fundamental rights that I believe all people should have.  Kids shouldn't be dying of drinking dirty water.\r\n\r\n I usually get to the office around 10 a.m. and check my calendar.  Often, I'll need to go straight into a meeting.  We have offices in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and California.  We started with the first two because my co-founder, Steve Hafner, lives in Connecticut, I live in Boston, and neither one of us wanted to move.  We got a California office when we acquired one of our competitors in 2007.  Steve and I talk every day, either on the phone or by instant message, and we can practically read each other's minds.  If an issue comes up, I know how he's going to weigh in and vice versa.  We trust each other.  If we ever get in a fight over something, whoever feels more strongly about it wins.\r\n\r\n Every week, Steve and a few others from the Connecticut office come here for meetings.  We spend a lot of money buying keywords on Google and Yahoo, so we analyze how those purchases are going.  On a typical day, I might have six or eight meetings.  I have an assistant, and my general rule is that half of my day is scheduled and half is unscheduled.  I like to walk around the office — see what's going on and work on product issues and design strategy.\r\n\r\n We have an open office environment.  I sit out with the product managers.  We hold design meetings at one another's desks throughout the day.  We do design interaction like that, where everyone can hear and anyone can jump in.  If anyone needs to make a private phone call, there are a few private offices, but our general philosophy is that an open environment facilitates intellectual intensity.  Most engineers are introverted.  Here, when people overhear a discussion, we encourage them to walk over and say, \"There's another way to do that.\"\r\n\r\n I get about 400 to 500 e-mails a day, and I probably send about 120.  At any given moment, I'll have only 10 items in my inbox.  When an e-mail comes in, I read it and decide immediately: Delete, reply, or delegate?\r\n Recommended Videos\r\n Leader in Motion: How Choreographer Bill T. Jones Collaborates\r\n Eboo Patel: How to Build an Inspirational Business\r\n How the SBA Can Help You Raise Money\r\n\r\n Customers are a big source of my e-mails.  Anytime anyone contacts us with a question, whether it's by e-mail or telephone, they get a personal reply.  The engineers and I handle customer support.  When I tell people that, they look at me like I'm smoking crack.  They say, \"Why would you pay an engineer $150,000 to answer phones when you could pay someone in Arizona $8 an hour?\"  If you make the engineers answer e-mails and phone calls from the customers, the second or third time they get the same question, they'll actually stop what they're doing and fix the code.  Then we don't have those questions anymore.\r\n\r\n About a year ago, I bought a red telephone with a really loud ringer for the office.  Whenever a customer calls the help number on our website, that phone rings.  The engineers initially complained about it.  They said, \"That's so friggin' annoying!\"  And I'd say, \"There's a really simple solution: Answer the friggin' phone and do whatever it takes to make that customer happy.  Then hang up, unplug the phone, walk it down to the other end of the office, and plug it in down there.\"\r\n\r\n It's like hot potato.  Except I take it seriously.  When the phone rings, I literally jump over the desks just so I can get to the phone before anyone else.  I love talking to customers, even angry ones.  I learn a lot from them about how to make the site easier to use.  When the call's over, I'll say, \"If you have any follow-up questions, my name is Paul English;  I'm the co-founder of the company.\"  I'll give out my personal cell-phone number.  Only one out of 20 people might actually call, but they're blown away when I do that.  We have four monitors in the office where you can see real-time streaming information about the site — how many visitors, how many click throughs.  It also displays the last customer e-mail that came in and the photo of the employee who answered it.  So you're walking by and you see, \"Oh, Dan just answered a question.\"  We developed our own customer support software.  One of the things it does is randomly select an employee response to a customer and send that response out to the entire company and to all of our investors each day.  It keeps us on our toes.\r\n\r\n I keep noon to 2 p.m. open, because I like going out to lunch.  It's also a time for me to socialize.  We have a very active work force.  Some days, a group of seven or eight of us will go out for a run.  Or we'll go out and play basketball, volleyball, or tennis.  I like to encourage that.  We had showers built in our offices.\r\n\r\n I spend a lot of my time on recruiting.  You could ask anyone in my office, \"What are Paul's priorities?\"  and they'll say: \"It's team, No. 1.  Then customer, then profit.\"  I really want to create the ultimate, most exciting dream team that's ever been created in software, and I focus on that every day.  I love to ask people, \"Who's the smartest person you ever met?  The most creative person?  The fastest?\"  Someone might say, \"This guy I met in Ohio 10 years ago, but I think he moved overseas.\"  I'll track him down.\r\n\r\n I once hired a guy because he had an Olympic medal in rowing.  That blew my mind.  I thought, This guy is hard core, and I bet that translates.  I love diversity of success.  But I also like diversity in style, thinking, and language: The engineers here are German, Greek, Russian, Italian, French, Indian.  One of my missions is that we will be able to answer every customer call, in any language.\r\n\r\n When I am hiring, I try to get people to accept the job before I tell them about salary or title.  I promise to make that person dramatically more productive, and that working for Kayak will be the most fun job he's ever had.  I need two things in return: a promise to strive to be the absolute best you can be.  And that you will be an energy amplifier — someone people are excited to work with.\r\n\r\n A lot of companies have the \"no assholes\" rule.  So if the greatest programmer ever is also a jerk, he's fired.  Our rule is \"no neutrals.\"  So when the new guy walks down the hall, is my team drawn to him?  Or do they divert their glance?  If they divert their glance, we fire that person.  I call it the hallway test, but it's more of a conceptual thing.  The idea is when you put superstars together, you can ask, \"What did you do today that excited the people around you and made them better at their jobs?\"  If you can't give examples, I don't want you here.\r\n\r\n I do all of the firing.  At times, I've fired maybe one out of every three people I've hired.  That might make people think I'm bad at hiring, but I think I'm quite good at hiring.  The only way 100 people can ever build a larger company than one that has more than 8,000 people — that's what Expedia has — is by hiring Olympic-quality, unbelievable all stars of technology.  My favorite metric is revenue per employee.\r\n\r\n I travel about once a week, but most of my trips are quick.  So I'm in California meeting with the team there or investors.  I'll help Steve with business development and look at companies we're trying to acquire.  I like to take my kids with me on longer trips.  A while ago, my daughter came with me to a global health conference in Zambia.  We got a week of close one-on-one time.\r\n\r\n We work really hard for 40 to 45 hours a week, but we believe in people having strong personal lives.  Over the past six years, there have been maybe five times I've spoken with Steve before 8 a.m., after 5 p.m., or on the weekend.\r\n Recommended Videos\r\n How the SBA Can Help You Raise Money\r\n Intuit's Scott Cook on Failed Global Expansion: 'We Should've Known Better'\r\n Eboo Patel: How to Build an Inspirational Business\r\n\r\n My drive home is 20 minutes.  Rush-hour traffic doesn't bother me.  When I get to red lights, I like to play this game with myself — I look around me for something extraordinary.  It might be sunlight hitting a building a certain way.  For the last several years, I have been studying Buddhism.  It has taught me to be a better manager and how to deal with things that 10 years ago would make me really angry and frustrated.  I work on trying to be present — in the moment.  It's something you can actually train yourself to do.\r\n\r\n After work, if my kids have a sporting event, I will go to that.  During baseball season, I go see the Red Sox.  When my son was 6, we started going to games together.  He loved it, but for me, it was really an excuse to sit next to him for three hours uninterrupted.  Over the years, though, I got hooked.  Now that he's 14, he wants to hang with his friends more than his dad.  So I invite friends to games.  But my son and I still go down to Fort Myers [Florida] every year for spring training.\r\n\r\n Every Tuesday night, I have an open dinner at my house.  I'm one of seven children, and six of us live nearby.  We're very close.  Anywhere between four and 15 of my relatives will show up for dinner.  I'm not a great cook, but it's fun to have people over.\r\n\r\n I read for an hour every night before going to bed.  I love reading books by Indian authors.  I'll also read books about global health and Africa, as well as a murder mystery now and then.  But I don't like business books.  There are so many things in life that are more interesting than business."

        "text":"characteristic mannerisms, as ‘very English’ or ‘typically English’.  We understand what someone means when they say, ‘In some ways I’m very English, but in other ways I’m not,’ or ‘You’re more English about that than I am’.  We have a concept of ‘degrees’ of Englishness.  I am not introducing anything new or startling here: our everyday use of these terms demonstrates that we all already have a clear grasp of the subtleties of ‘partial’ Englishness, or even ‘piecemeal’ or ‘cherry-picking’ Englishness.  We recognize that we can all, at least to some extent, ‘choose’ \r\n our degree of Englishness.  All I am saying is that these concepts can be applied equally to ethnic minorities. \r\n In fact, I would go so far as to say that Englishness is rather more a matter of choice for the ethnic minorities \r\n in this country than it is for the rest of us.  For those of us without the benefit of early, first-hand influence of \r\n another culture, some aspects of Englishness can be so deeply ingrained that we find it almost impossible to \r\n shake them off, even when it is clearly in our interests to do so (such as, in my case, when trying to conduct \r\n field experiments involving queue jumping).  Immigrants have the advantage of being able to pick and choose more freely, often adopting the more desirable English quirks and habits while carefully steering clear of the more ludicrous ones. \r\n I have some personal experience of such cultural cherry-picking.  My family emigrated to America when I was \r\n five, and we lived there for six years, during which entire time I steadfastly refused to adopt any trace of an \r\n American accent, on the grounds that it was aesthetically unpleasing (‘sounds horrid’ was how I put it at the \r\n time – dreadful little prig that I was), although I happily adapted to most other aspects of the culture.  As an \r\n adolescent, I lived for four years in rural France.  I attended the local state school and became indistinguishable in my speech, behaviour and manners from any other Briançonnaise teenager.  Except that I knew this was a matter of choice, and could judiciously shed those elements of Frenchness that annoyed my mother when I got home from school in the evening – or indeed deliberately exaggerate them to provoke her (some teenage behaviours are universal) – and discard those that proved socially unfavourable on our return to England. \r\n Immigrants can, of course, choose to ‘go native’, and some in this country become ‘more English than the \r\n English’.  Among my own friends, the two I would most readily describe as ‘very English’ are a first-generation \r\n Indian immigrant and a first-generation Polish refugee.  In both cases, their degree of Englishness was initially a conscious choice, and although it has since become second nature, they can still stand back and analyse their behaviour – and explain the rules they have learnt to obey – in a way that most native English find difficult, as we tend to take these things for granted.\r\n My sister had much the same experience when she married a Lebanese man and emigrated to Lebanon (from America) about eight years ago.  She became very quickly, to her Bek’aa Valley family and neighbours, a fully ‘acculturated’ Lebanese village housewife, but can switch back to Englishness (or Americanness, or indeed her teenage Frenchness) as easily as she changes languages – and often does both in mid-sentence.  Her children are American-Arab, with a few hints of Englishness, and equally adept at switching language, manners and mores when it suits them. \r\n Many of those who pontificate about ‘acculturation’ are inclined to underestimate this element of choice.  Such processes are often described in terms suggesting that the ‘dominant’ culture is simply imposed on unwitting, passive minorities, rather than focusing on the extent to which individuals quite consciously, deliberately, cleverly and even mockingly pick and choose among the behaviours and customs of their host culture.  I accept that some degree of acculturation or conformity to English ways is often ‘demanded’ or effectively ‘enforced’ (although this would surely be true of any host culture, unless one enters it as a conquering invader or passing tourist), and the rights and wrongs of specific demands can and should be debated.  But my point is that compliance with such demands is still a conscious process, and not, as some accounts of acculturation imply, a form of brainwashing. \r\n My only way of understanding this process is to assume that every immigrant to this country is at least as \r\n bright and clever as I was when we emigrated to France, just as capable of exercising free will and maintaining a sense of their own cultural identity while complying with the demands, however irrational or unfair, of the local culture.  I could crank up or tone down my Frenchness, by subtle degrees, in an entirely calculated manner.  My sister can choose and calibrate her Arabness, and my immigrant friends can do the same with their Englishness, sometimes for practical social purposes, including the avoidance of exclusion, but also purely for amusement. \r\n Perhaps the earnest researchers studying acculturation just don’t want to see that their ‘subjects’ have got the whole thing sussed, understand our culture better than we do, and are, much of the time, privately laughing at us.\r\n It should be obvious from all of this (but I’ll say it anyway) that when I speak of Englishness I am not putting \r\n a value on it, not holding it up above any other ‘-ness’.  When I say that some immigrants are more English than others, I am not (unlike Norman Tebbit with his infamous ‘Cricket Test’) implying that these individuals are in any way superior, or that their rights or status as citizens should be any different from those who are less English. \r\n And when I say that anyone can – given enough time and effort – ‘learn’ or ‘adopt’ Englishness, I am not \r\n suggesting that they ought to do so. \r\n The degree to which immigrants and ethnic minorities should be expected to adapt to fit in with English culture is a matter for debate.  Where immigrants from former British colonies are concerned, perhaps the degree of acculturation demanded should match that which we achieved as uninvited residents in their cultures.  Of all peoples, the English are surely historically the least qualified to preach about the importance of adapting to host-culture manners and mores.  Our own track-record on this is abysmal.  Wherever we settle in any numbers, we not only create pockets of utterly insular Englishness, but also often attempt to impose our cultural norms and habits on the local population. \r\n But this book is intended to be descriptive, not prescriptive.  I am interested in understanding Englishness as it is, warts and all.  It is not the anthropologist’s job to moralize and pontificate about how the tribe she is studyingought to treat its neighbours or its members.  I may have my opinions on such matters, but they are not relevant to my attempt to discover the rules of Englishness.  I may sometimes state these opinions anyway (it’s my book, so I can do what I like), but I will try to distinguish clearly between opinion and observation.\r\n\r\n BRITISHNESS AND ENGLISHNESS \r\n\r\n While I’m at it, this is a suitable place to apologize to any Scottish or Welsh people who (a) still regard \r\n themselves as British and (b) are wondering why I am writing about Englishness rather than Britishness.  (I am referring here to real, born-and-bred Scots and Welsh, by the way, not English people – like me – who like to boast of their drop of Welsh or Scottish ‘blood’ when it suits them.) \r\n The answer is that I am researching and writing about Englishness rather than Britishness: \r\npartly out of sheer laziness;  partly because England is a nation, and might reasonably be expected to have some sort of coherent and distinctive national culture or character, whereas Britain is a purely political construct, composed of several nations with their own distinctive cultures;  partly because although there may be a great deal of overlap between these cultures, they are clearly not identical and should not be treated as such by being lumped together under ‘Britishness’;  and finally because ‘Britishness’ seems to me to be a rather meaningless term: when people use it, they nearly always really mean ‘Englishness’ – they do not mean that someone is being frightfully Welsh or Scottish. \r\n I only have the time and energy to try to understand one of these cultures, and I have chosen my own, the \r\n English. \r\n I realise that one can, if one is being picky, pick all sorts of holes in these arguments – not least that a \r\n ‘nation’ is surely itself a pretty artificial construct – and Cornish ‘nationalists’ and even fervent regionalists from other parts of England (Yorkshire and Norfolk spring to mind) will no doubt insist that they too have their own separate identity and should not be bundled together with the rest of the English.\r\n The trouble is that virtually all nations have a number of regions, each of which invariably regards itself as \r\n different from, and superior to, all the others.  This applies in France, Italy, the US, Russia, Mexico, Spain, \r\nScotland, Australia – and more or less anywhere else you care to mention.  People from St Petersburg talk about Muscovites as though they were members of a different species;  East-coast and Mid-western Americans might as well be from different planets, ditto Tuscans and Neapolitans, Northern and Southern Mexicans, etc.;  even cities such as Melbourne and Sydney see themselves as having radically different characters – and let’s not start on Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Regionalism is hardly a peculiarly English phenomenon.  In all of these cases, however, the people of these admittedly highly individual regions and towns nevertheless have enough in common to make them recognizably Italian, American, Russian, Scottish, etc.  I am interested in those commonalities. \r\n\r\n STEREOTYPES AND CULTURAL GENOMICS \r\n\r\n ‘Well, I hope you’re going to get beyond the usual stereotypes’ was another common response when I told people I was doing research for a book on Englishness.  This comment seemed to reflect an assumption that a stereotype is almost by definition ‘not true’, that the truth lies somewhere else – wherever ‘beyond’ might be.  I find this rather strange, as I would naturally assume that, although not necessarily ‘the truth, the whole truth and nothing but’, stereotypes about English national character probably contain at least a grain or two of truth.  They do not, after all, just come out of thin air, but must have germinated and grown from something. \r\n So my standard reply was to say that, no, I was not going to get beyond the stereotypes, I was going to try \r\n to get inside them.  I would not specifically seek them out, but would keep an open mind;  and if my research \r\n showed that certain English behaviour patterns corresponded to a given stereotype, I would put that stereotype in my Petri-dish, stick it under my microscope, dissect it, tease it apart, subject its component bits to various tests, unravel its DNA and, er, generally poke away and puzzle over it until I found those grains (or genes) of truth.\r\n OK, there are probably some mixed metaphors in there, not to mention a somewhat hazy notion of what \r\n proper scientists actually do in their labs, but you get the idea.  Most things look rather different when you put \r\n them under a microscope, and sure enough, I found that stereotypes such as English ‘reserve’, ‘politeness’, \r\n‘weather-talk’, ‘hooliganism’, ‘hypocrisy’, ‘privacy’, ‘anti-intellectualism’, ‘queuing’, ‘compromise’, ‘fair play’, \r\n‘humour’, ‘class-consciousness’, ‘eccentricity’ and so on were not quite what they seemed – and they all had \r\n complex layers of rules and codes that were not visible to the naked eye.  Without getting too carried away by \r\n these lab-analogies, I suppose another way of describing my Englishness project would be as an attempt to \r\n sequence (or map, I’m never sure which is which) the English cultural genome – to identify the cultural ‘codes’ that make us who we are. \r\n Hmm, yes, Sequencing the English Cultural Genome – that sounds like a big, serious, ambitious and \r\n impressively scientific project.  The sort of thing that might well take three times longer than the period originally agreed in the publisher’s contract, especially if you allow for all the tea-breaks.\r\n 1.  A term coined by my father, the anthropologist Robin Fox, meaning blindness to underlying similarities between human groups and cultures because one is dazzled by the more highly visible surface differences. \r\n 2.  Such as the social psychologist Michael Argyle, who studied happiness, and the anthropologist Lionel Tiger, who has written books on optimism and pleasure, and teaches a course entitled ‘The Anthropology of Fun and Games’. \r\n 3.  We do, in fact, have some rules prohibiting behaviours which, while not inconceivable, are unlikely or even unnatural – see Robin Fox’s work on the incest taboo, for example – cases where a factual ‘it isn’t done’ becomes formalized as a proscriptive ‘thou shalt not do it’ (despite the claims of philosophers who hold that it is logically impossible to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’), but these tend to be universal rules, rather than the culture-specific rules that concern us here. \r\n 4.  Although I was recently given a rather charming book, published in 1931, entitled ‘The English: Are They Human?’  The question is rhetorical, as one might expect.  The author (G.J. Renier) ‘came to the conclusion that the world is inhabited by two species of human beings: mankind and the English.’ \r\n 5. "

        "text":" Reality must pre-exist to every assertion for which truth is\r\n claimed.  And, not content with this overuse of one particular type of\r\n judgment, our critics claim its monopoly.  They appear to wish to cut off\r\n Humanism from its rights to any retrospection at all.\r\n\r\n Humanism says that satisfactoriness is what distinguishes the true from\r\n the false.  But satisfactoriness is both a subjective quality, and a\r\n present one.  _Ergo_ (the critics appear to reason) an object, _quâ_\r\n true, must always for humanism be both present and subjective, and a\r\n humanist's belief can never be in anything that lives outside of the\r\n belief itself or ante-dates it.  Why so preposterous a charge should be\r\n so current, I find it hard to say.  Nothing is more obvious than the fact\r\n that both the objective and the past existence of the object may be the\r\n very things about it that most seem satisfactory, and that most invite\r\n us to believe them.  The past tense can figure in the humanist's world,\r\nas well of belief as of representation, quite as harmoniously as in the\r\n world of any one else.\r\n\r\n Mr. Joseph gives a special turn to this accusation.  He charges me[133]\r\n with being self-contradictory when I say that the main categories of\r\n thought were evolved in the course of experience itself.  For I use these\r\n very categories to define the course of experience by.  Experience, as I\r\n talk about it, is a product of their use;  and yet I take it as true\r\n anteriorly to them.  This seems to Mr. Joseph to be an absurdity.  I hope\r\n it does not seem such to his readers;  for if experiences can suggest\r\n hypotheses at all (and they notoriously do so) I can see no absurdity\r\n whatever in the notion of a retrospective hypothesis having for its\r\n object the very train of experiences by which its own being, along with\r\n that of other things, has been brought about.  If the hypothesis is\r\n 'satisfactory' we must, of course, believe it to have been true\r\n anteriorly to its formulation by ourselves.  Every explanation of a\r\n present by a past seems to involve this kind of circle, which is not a\r\n vicious circle.  The past is _causa existendi_ of the present, which in\r\n turn is _causa cognoscendi_ of the past.  If the present were treated as\r\n _causa existendi_ of the past, the circle might indeed be vicious.\r\n\r\n Closely connected with this pseudo-difficulty is another one of wider\r\n scope and greater complication—more excusable therefore. [134]\r\n Humanism, namely, asking how truth in point of fact is reached, and\r\n seeing that it is by ever substituting more satisfactory for less\r\n satisfactory opinions, is thereby led into a vague historic sketch of\r\n truth's development.  The earliest 'opinions,' it thinks, must have been\r\n dim, unconnected 'feelings,' and only little by little did more and more\r\n orderly views of things replace them.  Our own retrospective view of this\r\n whole evolution is now, let us say, the latest candidate for 'truth' as\r\n yet reached in the process.  To be a satisfactory candidate, it must give\r\n some definite sort of a picture of what forces keep the process going.\r\n On the subjective side we have a fairly definite picture—sensation,\r\nassociation, interest, hypothesis, these account in a general way for\r\n the growth into a cosmos of the relative chaos with which the mind\r\n began.\r\n\r\n But on the side of the object, so to call it roughly, our view is much\r\n less satisfactory.  Of which of our many objects are we to believe that\r\n it truly _was_ there and at work before the human mind began?  Time,\r\nspace, kind, number, serial order, cause, consciousness, are hard things\r\n not to objectify—even transcendental idealism leaves them standing as\r\n 'empirically real.'  Substance, matter, force, fall down more easily\r\n before criticism, and secondary qualities make almost no resistance at\r\n all.  Nevertheless, when we survey the field of speculation, from\r\n Scholasticism through Kantism to Spencerism, we find an ever-recurring\r\n tendency to convert the pre-human into a merely logical object, an\r\n unknowable _ding-an-sich_, that but starts the process, or a vague\r\n _materia prima_ that but receives our forms. [135]\r\n\r\n The reasons for this are not so much logical as they are material.  We\r\n can postulate an extra-mental _that_ freely enough (though some\r\n idealists have denied us the privilege), but when we have done so, the\r\n _what_ of it is hard to determine satisfactorily, because of the\r\n oppositions and entanglements of the variously proposed _whats_ with one\r\n another and with the history of the human mind.  The literature of\r\n speculative cosmology bears witness to this difficulty.  Humanism suffers\r\n from it no more than any other philosophy suffers, but it makes all our\r\n cosmogonic theories so unsatisfactory that some thinkers seek relief in\r\n the denial of any primal dualism.  Absolute Thought or 'pure experience'\r\n is postulated, and endowed with attributes calculated to justify the\r\n belief that it may 'run itself.'  Both these truth-claiming hypotheses\r\n are non-dualistic in the old mind-and-matter sense;  but the one is\r\n monistic and the other pluralistic as to the world process itself.  Some\r\n humanists are non-dualists of this sort—I myself am one _und zwar_ of\r\n the pluralistic brand.  But doubtless dualistic humanists also exist, as\r\n well as non-dualistic ones of the monistic wing.\r\n\r\n Mr. Joseph pins these general philosophic difficulties on humanism\r\n alone, or possibly on me alone.  My article spoke vaguely of a 'most\r\n chaotic pure experience' coming first, and building up the mind. [136]\r\n But how can two structureless things interact so as to produce a\r\n structure?  my critic triumphantly asks.  Of course they can't, as purely\r\n so-named entities.  We must make additional hypotheses.  We must beg a\r\n minimum of structure for them.  The _kind_ of minimum that _might_ have\r\n tended to increase towards what we now find actually developed is the\r\n philosophical desideratum here.  The question is that of the most\r\n materially satisfactory hypothesis.  Mr. Joseph handles it by formal\r\n logic purely, as if he had no acquaintance with the logic of hypothesis\r\n at all.\r\n\r\n Mr. Joseph again is much bewildered as to what a humanist can mean when\r\n he uses the word knowledge.  He tries to convict me[137] of vaguely\r\n identifying it with any kind of good.  Knowledge is a difficult thing to\r\n define briefly, and Mr. Joseph shows his own constructive hand here even\r\n less than in the rest of his article.  I have myself put forth on\r\n several occasions a radically pragmatist account of knowledge,[138] the\r\n existence of which account my critic probably does not know of—so\r\n perhaps I had better not say anything about knowledge until he reads and\r\n attacks that.  I will say, however, that whatever the relation called\r\n knowing may itself prove to consist in, I can think of no conceivable\r\n kind of _object_ which may not become an object of knowledge on\r\n humanistic principles as well as on the principles of any other\r\n philosophy. [139]\r\n\r\n I confess that I am pretty steadily hampered by the habit, on the part\r\n of humanism's critics, of assuming that they have truer ideas than mine\r\n of truth and knowledge, the nature of which I must know of and can not\r\n need to have re-defined.  I have consequently to reconstruct these ideas\r\n in order to carry on the discussion (I have e.g. had to do so in some\r\n parts of this article) and I thereby expose myself to charges of\r\n caricature.  In one part of Mr. Joseph's attack, however, I rejoice that\r\n we are free from this embarrassment.  It is an important point and covers\r\n probably a genuine difficulty, so I take it up last.\r\n\r\n When, following Schiller and Dewey, I define the true as that which\r\n gives the maximal combination of satisfactions, and say that\r\n satisfaction is a many-dimensional term that can be realized in various\r\n ways, Mr. Joseph replies, rightly enough, that the chief satisfaction of\r\n a rational creature must always be his thought that what he believes is\r\n _true_, whether the truth brings him the satisfaction of collateral\r\n profits or not.  This would seem, however, to make of truth the prior\r\n concept, and to relegate satisfaction to a secondary place.\r\n\r\n Again, if to be satisfactory is what is meant by being true, _whose_\r\n satisfactions, and _which_ of his satisfactions, are to count?\r\n Discriminations notoriously have to be made;  and the upshot is that only\r\n rational candidates and intellectual satisfactions stand the test.  We\r\n are then driven to a purely theoretic notion of truth, and get out of\r\n the pragmatic atmosphere altogether.  And with this Mr. Joseph leaves\r\n us—truth is truth, and there is an end of the matter.  But he makes a\r\n very pretty show of convicting me of self-stultification in according to\r\n our purely theoretic satisfactions any place in the humanistic scheme.\r\n They crowd the collateral satisfactions out of house and home, he\r\n thinks, and pragmatism has to go into bankruptcy if she recognizes them\r\n at all.\r\n\r\n There is no room for disagreement about the facts here;  but the\r\n destructive force of the reasoning disappears as soon as we talk\r\n concretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in our quality of good\r\n pragmatists, just what the famous theoretic needs are known as and in\r\n what the intellectual satisfactions consist.  Mr. Joseph, faithful to the\r\n habits of his party, makes no attempt at characterizing them, but\r\n assumes that their nature is self-evident to all.\r\n\r\n Are they not all mere matters of _consistency_—and emphatically _not_\r\n of consistency between an Absolute Reality and the mind's copies of it,\r\nbut of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and manners\r\n of reacting, in the mind?  And are not both our need of such consistency\r\n and our pleasure in it conceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that\r\n we are beings that develop mental _habits_—habit itself proving\r\n adaptively beneficial in an environment where the same objects, or the\r\n same kinds of objects, recur and follow 'law'?  If this were so, what\r\n would have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit,\r\nand the theoretic life would have grown up in aid of these.  In point of\r\n fact this seems to have been the probable case.  At life's origin, any\r\n present perception may have been 'true'—if such a word could then be\r\n applicable.  Later, when reactions became organized, the reactions became\r\n 'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them.  Otherwise they were\r\n 'false' or 'mistaken' reactions.  But the same class of objects needs the\r\n same kind of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently must\r\n"

Welcome to daily English vocabulary, episode nine. \r\n\r\n Today's new phrase is May I take your.  Let's find out what it means and how to use this phrase in your daily\r\n conversation.\r\n\r\n May I take your, so what it means?  Let's take an example.\r\n\r\n May i take your name?  or what is your name?  - which one is correct?  Well, both sentences are correct, but may i take your name sounds more polite informal.  So, May I take your means more polite or formal way of asking for something.\r\n\r\n May is also used in asking and giving permissions.  Now if you said \"what is your name?\"  is correct when you are writing somebody's name, but it's not really polite or formal in a business situation.  You can use this phrase when you were are going to write down the person's name for other details.\r\n\r\n Well, if you meet somebody on the street or the restaurant, you wouldn't say \"may i take your name\".  This phrase is more applicable in office setting or customer service department.  Whether operator has to write down the details of the customer, it sounds more formal. \r\n\r\n Now let's look at some example sentences, those you hear when you call the customer service department.\r\n\r\n Example one\r\n You call to computer service company and want to speak to John, a hardware engineer to explain your problem.  The receptionist would say: May I take your name, please?  She meanes she wants to make a note of your name.\r\n\r\n Example two\r\n In continuation to your conversation with the receptionist.  She tells you that John isn't there, at her desk.  She will take down your phone number and ask John to call you back.  Listen how she will say.  John isn't there at his desk.  May I take your phone number and ask John to call you back later?\r\n\r\n Example three\r\n Your computer is in the computer company for repairs, and you want to use your neighbors computer.  How will you ask for the same in a polite way?  My computer is on the repair, may i use your computer until next monday?  Yes, you may."
