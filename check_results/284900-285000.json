        "text":" ABSTRACT\r\n The use of the polymeric composite materials has been increasing but these materials have environmental problems related to the discard.  To reduce the discard deleterious effect, coconuts, sisal, as well as sugar cane pulp natural based fiber have been studied to replace the synthetic ones.  These fibers embedded in a polymeric matrix plays a similar role as the synthetic ones, in terms of mechanical and thermal properties.  The natural fibers are environmentally friendly, easy to recycle and biodegradable.  The aim of this work is the study of ionizing radiation effects on the properties of recycled polypropylene composites, reinforced with 10%, 15% and 20% of the coconut fibers, using as coupling agent a substance based on maleic anhydride (MAPP) graphitized polypropylene.  The samples were molded by injection, irradiated and submitted to thermal and mechanical tests.  The mechanical properties (hardness, impact strength and tensile strength), temperature of thermal distortion (HDT) and Vicat softening temperature of the non irradiated and irradiated composites were determined.  The irradiation doses were of 30, 50 and 100kGy in a gamma cell.  Regarding the thermal and mechanical properties of non-irradiated samples, the incorporation of coconut fibers to polypropylene resulted in a decrease of impact strength, tensile strength and Vicat softening temperature as well as in an increase in hardness and HDT.  This result indicates that the coconut fibers do not act like a reinforcement agent but as biodegradable filler.  In the irradiated samples, it was observed a decrease in the impact strength, tensile strength, HDT, and thermal distortion temperature and an increase in the hardness and tensile strength.  The Vicat softening temperature shows no change. \r\n 1.  INTRODUCTION\r\n Industrial components produced from plastics have been increasing since the middle of the 1950.  The project evolution due to the new environmental law promotes plastic based materials with extraordinary chemical and physical properties.  They have been introduced in many applications, as for example in the aeronautical industry, were they can be considered as new materials.  The combination of two or more materials leads to a new material class named as composite materials, with higher properties, that can not be achieved by the individual parts [1].  One of the more studied and used polymeric matrixes for obtain loaded or reinforced polymers is the polypropylene (PP), therefore, due its properties and low cost presents good conditions of commercialization [2-3].  Currently, the more used reinforcements in the industry are the synthetic fibers, mainly the glass fiber, due its good physical and chemical properties.  On the other hand, these materials, have problems related to the discarding, therefore they are not biodegradable being, therefore, harmful to the environment.  Ahead this, due to the increasing appeal for ambient and social questions, natural materials capable to substitute those aggressive ones to the nature has been studied.  In this direction, many researches deals with the substitution of synthetic fibers by the natural fibers, as coconut, sisal, bamboo, among others, beyond the use of recyclables polymeric matrixes and already the recycled ones [4-6].  The natural fibers are increasing in application as reinforcement in thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, due to properties as good mechanical resistance and low density.  The synthetic fiber substitution, as the glass fibers, by the natural ones, have being studied, and they offer some advantages: are renewed resources and available in great amount, are biodegradable, presents lower abrasive nature, can be recycled, although it still presents high cost.  The availability of great amounts of such fibers with mechanical properties well defined is generally prerequisite for the successful use of these materials [5-7].\r\n The PP matrix already is used in many industrial applications, mainly in the automobile industry, in the manufacture of components as the covering of panels, lateral of doors of trucks, as well as other internal covering parts of automobiles.  Moreover, toy industries have invested in research in this area, being utilized the PP with wood flour filler [8].  In the mix process of polymeric matrix with the dispersed phase, due the different nature of materials can occur problems of linking in the interface.  For a perfect combination between the matrix and the dispersed phase are used additive that have the function of to act as coupling agents.  They act as molecular bridges in the interface of the two phases [7-8].  The grafting maleic anhydride polypropylene compound (MAPP) is one of the types of coupling agents more used in polymeric materials [9].  In the present work were used the MAPP and barium titanate of will be used as coupling agent.  The ionizing radiation is a process capable to modify the properties of a material and can be used as an alternative in the development of new polymeric materials [10].  The main effects caused in polymers by the ionizing radiation are the main chain scission and appearance of crosslinking [11].  When the crosslinking predominance forming three-dimensional nets.  The process occurs by the recombination of radicals formed by irradiation of polymer.  In the crossed linking, the polymeric chains connect themselves through covalent joining generated by chemical joining or by radiation.  During the crosslinking, there is an increase of the molecular weight, mechanical resistance, and three-dimensional nets of the system, viscosity and the reduction of the solubility of the irradiated polymer and a change in the temperature of the transition glass in amorphous phase of the irradiated polymer.  This mechanism also depends on the dose, dose rate, concentration, irradiation atmosphere among others.  However, the polymer sensibility to parameter changes depends on the type and size of the chains, as well as the polymer morphology [12-13].  The aim of this work is to study the effects of ionizing radiation on the properties of recycled polypropylene composites, reinforced with coconut fibers.\r\n 2.  EXPERIMENTAL\r\n 2.1.  Materials\r\n In this work were used the following materials:\r\n- Virgin polypropylene: PP Prolen TM 6100, supplied by Quattor Indústria Petroquímica S.A., with density of 0.95 g/cm3;\r\n - Recycled polypropylene: polypropylene collected in the campus of Presbyterian Mackenzie University;\r\n - Coconut Fiber: supplied by POEMATEC;\r\n - Barium titanate: supplied by Certonic Ind. e Com.  Ltda.;\r\n - MAPP: OREVAC CA, grafting maleic anhydride polypropylene, supplied by Atofina.\r\n 2.2.  Methods\r\n Were studied 5 types of samples composites: virgin PP, pure recycle PP and recycle PP with addiction of 10, 15 and 20% of coconut fiber.\r\n - Treatment of coconut fiber: The fibers were treat during 30minutes with 1% of the one solution containing 5% of ethanol in water, with pH 4.5-5.5, correct with ethanoic acid, where 2% the barium titanate (TiBa) coupling agent were dissolved.  After this time, the fibers were washed with ethanol and to follow were dried in oven, for 2hours, approximately 40°C.\r\n - Components Mix: the mix of the coconut fiber with recycled polypropylene contends 0.5% of MAPP was carried through in the calender in a temperature of approximately 180°C.  The calendered composition was perforated through a mill of knives.  After the samples were developed in a Torque Rheometer Haake, model Rheocord 90.  It was connected to a simple extrusion screw with the following temperatures in the heating zones: 160ºC, 165ºC, 170ºC, 170ºC, using an internal mixer Rheomix 600 as accessory.  It was connected to a simple extrusion screw with the following temperatures in the heating zones: 170ºC, 175ºC, 190ºC, 200ºC.  The samples based on pure virgin PP and pure recycled PP also were processed by\r\n calendaring and extrusion.\r\n - Samples molding: after extrusion the pure PP, the pure recycled PP and recycled PP contain 10, 15 and 20% of Samples irradiation: The samples were exposed to gamma rays from Cobalto-60 at doses: 30, 50 and 100kGy.  The samples were characterized by: tensile strength (ASTM D-638-94);  impact Izod strength\r\n (ASTM D-256);  thermal distortion temperature-HDT (ASTM D-648) and soften Vicat point (ASTM D-1525-81).\r\n The comportment of the composites was determined by thermal analysis by differential scanning-calorimetry (DSC).  It was carried through in the band of temperature between 40 and 250oC, in a reason of heating of 10oCmin-1 and nitrogen atmosphere.  To calculate the cristalinity degree of the samples was used the reference value to fusion enthalpy of the polypropylene (210 Jg-1) [14].\r\n 3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\r\n 3.1.  Tensile Strength\r\n The tensile strength was determined for composites of pure virgin PP, pure recycled PP and PP reinforced with 10, 15 and 20% of coconut fibers to irradiated and non irradiated samples.  Fig. 1 and 2 present the results of tensile strength for studied composites.  The results show that: \r\n- Due to degradation during the recycling the pure recycled presents tensile strength values smaller than the pure virgin PP;\r\n - The tensile strength of the pure recycled PP is significantly higher that the tensile strength of the recycled PP reinforced with coconut fiber;\r\n - The fiber addition decreases the elongation of composites.  The decrease is proportional to the fiber concentration;\r\n - The coconut fiber addition hardens the material, diminishing its elasticity;\r\n - The tensile strength and elongation decrease with the irradiation due to its effect on the polymeric matrix degradation;\r\n - To samples contend the same coconut fiber concentration irradiated at 30 and 50kGy the tensile strength is practically the same;\r\n - To samples contend coconut fiber present the same elongation. \r\n 3.2.  Impact Strength Izod\r\n Fig. 3 presents the results impact strength for PP/coconut fiber samples.\r\n The results show that:\r\n- The impact strength values decrease with the fiber concentration in the composite;\r\n - The impact strength decrease with the irradiation due to its effect on the polymeric matrix degradation.\r\n - To samples contend 15 and 20% of the coconut fiber the impact strength is practically the same.\r\n 3.3.  Thermal Distortion Temperature-HDT\r\n Fig. 4 presents the results of HDT tests for samples obtained.\r\n Analyzing the values of Figure 4, it can be observed that:\r\n- The presence of the coconut fiber increases the HDT;\r\n - The ionizing radiation decreases the HDT of the samples, probably due to the degradation effect on the polymeric matrix;\r\n - The HDT increase with the dose irradiation for the same coconut fiber concentration;\r\n - The reinforced samples present HDT values higher than pure virgin PP;\r\n - The addition of fiber reinforcement increases the HDT values in accordance with the fiber\r\n concentration, in the range studied in this work;\r\n - The fiber introduced in the composite increase the thermal stability of composites.\r\n The results show that:\r\n- The addiction of fiber reinforcement decreases the soften Vicat point of the samples.  The reduction for all concentrations studied was the same.  Probably, the degradation are not related to the fiber contend;  support."

        "text":"Steger got in his objection at this point, and created a considerable diversion from the main theme, because Stener kept saying he \"thought\" or he \"believed.\"\r\n\r\n \"Object!\"  shouted Steger, repeatedly.  \"I move that that be stricken from the record as incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial.  The witness is not allowed to say what he thinks, and the prosecution knows it very well.\"\r\n\r\n \"Your honor,\" insisted Shannon, \"I am doing the best I can to have the witness tell a plain, straightforward story, and I think that it is obvious that he is doing so.\"\r\n\r\n \"Object!\"  reiterated Steger, vociferously.  \"Your honor, I insist that the district attorney has no right to prejudice the minds of the jury by flattering estimates of the sincerity of the witness.  What he thinks of the witness and his sincerity is of no importance in this case.  I must ask that your honor caution him plainly in this matter.\"\r\n\r\n \"Objection sustained,\" declared Judge Payderson, \"the prosecution will please be more explicit\";  and Shannon went on with his case.\r\n\r\n Stener's testimony, in one respect, was most important, for it made plain what Cowperwood did not want brought out—namely, that he and Stener had had a dispute before this;  that Stener had distinctly told Cowperwood that he would not loan him any more money;  that Cowperwood had told Stener, on the day before he secured this check, and again on that very day, that he was in a very desperate situation financially, and that if he were not assisted to the extent of three hundred thousand dollars he would fail, and that then both he and Stener would be ruined.  On the morning of this day, according to Stener, he had sent Cowperwood a letter ordering him to cease purchasing city loan certificates for the sinking-fund.  It was after their conversation on the same afternoon that Cowperwood surreptitiously secured the check for sixty thousand dollars from Albert Stires without his (Stener's) knowledge;  and it was subsequent to this latter again that Stener, sending Albert to demand the return of the check, was refused, though the next day at five o'clock in the afternoon Cowperwood made an assignment.  And the certificates for which the check had been purloined were not in the sinking-fund as they should have been.  This was dark testimony for Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n If any one imagines that all this was done without many vehement objections and exceptions made and taken by Steger, and subsequently when he was cross-examining Stener, by Shannon, he errs greatly.  At times the chamber was coruscating with these two gentlemen's bitter wrangles, and his honor was compelled to hammer his desk with his gavel, and to threaten both with contempt of court, in order to bring them to a sense of order.  Indeed while Payderson was highly incensed, the jury was amused and interested.\r\n\r\n \"You gentlemen will have to stop this, or I tell you now that you will both be heavily fined.  This is a court of law, not a bar-room.  Mr. Steger, I expect you to apologize to me and your colleague at once.  Mr. Shannon, I must ask that you use less aggressive methods.  Your manner is offensive to me.  It is not becoming to a court of law.  I will not caution either of you again.\"\r\n\r\n Both lawyers apologized as lawyers do on such occasions, but it really made but little difference.  Their individual attitudes and moods continued about as before.\r\n\r\n \"What did he say to you,\" asked Shannon of Stener, after one of these troublesome interruptions, \"on that occasion, October 9th last, when he came to you and demanded the loan of an additional three hundred thousand dollars?  Give his words as near as you can remember—exactly, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n \"Object!\"  interposed Steger, vigorously.  \"His exact words are not recorded anywhere except in Mr. Stener's memory, and his memory of them cannot be admitted in this case.  The witness has testified to the general facts.\"\r\n\r\n Judge Payderson smiled grimly.  \"Objection overruled,\" he returned.\r\n\r\n \"Exception!\"  shouted Steger.\r\n\r\n \"He said, as near as I can remember,\" replied Stener, drumming on the arms of the witness-chair in a nervous way, \"that if I didn't give him three hundred thousand dollars he was going to fail, and I would be poor and go to the penitentiary.\"\r\n\r\n \"Object!\"  shouted Stager, leaping to his feet.  \"Your honor, I object to the whole manner in which this examination is being conducted by the prosecution.  The evidence which the district attorney is here trying to extract from the uncertain memory of the witness is in defiance of all law and precedent, and has no definite bearing on the facts of the case, and could not disprove or substantiate whether Mr. Cowperwood thought or did not think that he was going to fail.  Mr. Stener might give one version of this conversation or any conversation that took place at this time, and Mr. Cowperwood another.  As a matter of fact, their versions are different.  I see no point in Mr. Shannon's line of inquiry, unless it is to prejudice the jury's minds towards accepting certain allegations which the prosecution is pleased to make and which it cannot possibly substantiate.  I think you ought to caution the witness to testify only in regard to things that he recalls exactly, not to what he thinks he remembers;  and for my part I think that all that has been testified to in the last five minutes might be well stricken out.\"\r\n\r\n \"Objection overruled,\" replied Judge Payderson, rather indifferently;  and Steger who had been talking merely to overcome the weight of Stener's testimony in the minds of the jury, sat down.\r\n\r\n Shannon once more approached Stener.\r\n\r\n \"Now, as near as you can remember, Mr. Stener, I wish you would tell the jury what else it was that Mr. Cowperwood said on that occasion.  He certainly didn't stop with the remark that you would be ruined and go to the penitentiary.  Wasn't there other language that was employed on that occasion?\"\r\n\r\n \"He said, as far as I can remember,\" replied Stener, \"that there were a lot of political schemers who were trying to frighten me, that if I didn't give him three hundred thousand dollars we would both be ruined, and that I might as well be tried for stealing a sheep as a lamb.\"\r\n\r\n \"Ha!\"  yelled Shannon.  \"He said that, did he?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir;  he did,\" said Stener.\r\n\r\n \"How did he say it, exactly?  What were his exact words?\"  Shannon demanded, emphatically, pointing a forceful forefinger at Stener in order to key him up to a clear memory of what had transpired.\r\n\r\n \"Well, as near as I can remember, he said just that,\" replied Stener, vaguely.  \"You might as well be tried for stealing a sheep as a lamb.\"\r\n\r\n \"Exactly!\"  exclaimed Shannon, whirling around past the jury to look at Cowperwood.  \"I thought so.\"\r\n\r\n \"Pure pyrotechnics, your honor,\" said Steger, rising to his feet on the instant.  \"All intended to prejudice the minds of the jury.  Acting.  I wish you would caution the counsel for the prosecution to confine himself to the evidence in hand, and not act for the benefit of his case.\"\r\n\r\n The spectators smiled;  and Judge Payderson, noting it, frowned severely.  \"Do you make that as an objection, Mr. Steger?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"I certainly do, your honor,\" insisted Steger, resourcefully.\r\n\r\n \"Objection overruled.  Neither counsel for the prosecution nor for the defense is limited to a peculiar routine of expression.\"\r\n\r\n Steger himself was ready to smile, but he did not dare to.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood fearing the force of such testimony and regretting it, still looked at Stener, pityingly.  The feebleness of the man;  the weakness of the man;  the pass to which his cowardice had brought them both!\r\n\r\n When Shannon was through bringing out this unsatisfactory data, Steger took Stener in hand;  but he could not make as much out of him as he hoped.  In so far as this particular situation was concerned, Stener was telling the exact truth;  and it is hard to weaken the effect of the exact truth by any subtlety of interpretation, though it can, sometimes, be done.  With painstaking care Steger went over all the ground of Stener's long relationship with Cowperwood, and tried to make it appear that Cowperwood was invariably the disinterested agent—not the ringleader in a subtle, really criminal adventure.  It was hard to do, but he made a fine impression.  Still the jury listened with skeptical minds.  It might not be fair to punish Cowperwood for seizing with avidity upon a splendid chance to get rich quick, they thought;  but it certainly was not worth while to throw a veil of innocence over such palpable human cupidity.  Finally, both lawyers were through with Stener for the time being, anyhow, and then Albert Stires was called to the stand.\r\n\r\n He was the same thin, pleasant, alert, rather agreeable soul that he had been in the heyday of his clerkly prosperity—a little paler now, but not otherwise changed.  His small property had been saved for him by Cowperwood, who had advised Steger to inform the Municipal Reform Association that Stires' bondsmen were attempting to sequestrate it for their own benefit, when actually it should go to the city if there were any real claim against him—which there was not.  That watchful organization had issued one of its numerous reports covering this point, and Albert had had the pleasure of seeing Strobik and the others withdraw in haste.  Naturally he was grateful to Cowperwood, even though once he had been compelled to cry in vain in his presence.  He was anxious now to do anything he could to help the banker, but his naturally truthful disposition prevented him from telling anything except the plain facts, which were partly beneficial and partly not.\r\n\r\n Stires testified that he recalled Cowperwood's saying that he had purchased the certificates, that he was entitled to the money, that Stener was unduly frightened, and that no harm would come to him, Albert.  He identified certain memoranda in the city treasurer's books, which were produced, as being accurate, and others in Cowperwood's books, which were also produced, as being corroborative.  His testimony as to Stener's astonishment on discovering that his chief clerk had given Cowperwood a check was against the latter;  but Cowperwood hoped to overcome the effect of this by his own testimony later.\r\n\r\n Up to now both Steger and Cowperwood felt that they were doing fairly well, and that they need not be surprised if they won their case. \r\n\r\n Chapter XLII\r\n\r\n The trial moved on.

        "text":" and then you have such a spectacle as was described here this afternoon in the witness-chair by Mr. Stener—that is, you have a vicious, greedy, unmerciful financial wolf standing over a cowering, unsophisticated commercial lamb, and saying to him, his white, shiny teeth glittering all the while, 'If you don't advance me the money I ask for—the three hundred thousand dollars I now demand—you will be a convict, your children will be thrown in the street, you and your wife and your family will be in poverty again, and there will be no one to turn a hand for you.'  That is what Mr. Stener says Mr. Cowperwood said to him.  I, for my part, haven't a doubt in the world that he did.  Mr. Steger, in his very guarded references to his client, describes him as a nice, kind, gentlemanly agent, a broker merely on whom was practically forced the use of five hundred thousand dollars at two and a half per cent.  when money was bringing from ten to fifteen per cent.  in Third Street on call loans, and even more.  But I for one don't choose to believe it.  The thing that strikes me as strange in all of this is that if he was so nice and kind and gentle and remote—a mere hired and therefore subservient agent—how is it that he could have gone to Mr. Stener's office two or three days before the matter of this sixty-thousand-dollar check came up and say to him, as Mr. Stener testifies under oath that he did say to him, 'If you don't give me three hundred thousand dollars' worth more of the city's money at once, to-day, I will fail, and you will be a convict.  You will go to the penitentiary.' ?  That's what he said to him.  ' I will fail and you will be a convict.  They can't touch me, but they will arrest you.  I am an agent merely.'  Does that sound like a nice, mild, innocent, well-mannered agent, a hired broker, or doesn't it sound like a hard, defiant, contemptuous master—a man in control and ready to rule and win by fair means or foul?\r\n\r\n \"Gentlemen, I hold no brief for George W. Stener.  In my judgment he is as guilty as his smug co-partner in crime—if not more so— this oily financier who came smiling and in sheep's clothing, pointing out subtle ways by which the city's money could be made profitable for both;  but when I hear Mr. Cowperwood described as I have just heard him described, as a nice, mild, innocent agent, my gorge rises.  Why, gentlemen, if you want to get a right point of view on this whole proposition you will have to go back about ten or twelve years and see Mr. George W. Stener as he was then, a rather poverty-stricken beginner in politics, and before this very subtle and capable broker and agent came along and pointed out ways and means by which the city's money could be made profitable;  George W. Stener wasn't very much of a personage then, and neither was Frank A. Cowperwood when he found Stener newly elected to the office of city treasurer.  Can't you see him arriving at that time nice and fresh and young and well dressed, as shrewd as a fox, and saying: 'Come to me.  Let me handle city loan.  Loan me the city's money at two per cent.  or less.'  Can't you hear him suggesting this?  Can't you see him?\r\n\r\n \"George W. Stener was a poor man, comparatively a very poor man, when he first became city treasurer.  All he had was a small real-estate and insurance business which brought him in, say, twenty-five hundred dollars a year.  He had a wife and four children to support, and he had never had the slightest taste of what for him might be called luxury or comfort. "

        "text":"[Neil]: Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and joining me in this programme to talk about dangerous holiday activities is Rob.  Hi there Rob.\r\n [Rob]: Hello Neil.\r\n [Neil]: So tell me Rob, I know that you've done a fair amount of travelling in your time.  You must have come across a few situations or signed up for some activities which you look back on now and think... hmmm, that was really dangerous.\r\n [Rob]: Yes, I went white water rafting in Indonesia a few years ago and that was quite scary, particularly because of the size of the boat they brought along – it was the sort of boat you get at the seaside, almost like a toy that you'd go out on the sea on.  So what about you, Neil?  What's the most dangerous thing you've done on holiday?\r\n [Neil]: Well, I was backpacking in South America with a friend of mine a few years ago and I saw a sign advertising 'The most dangerous bike ride in the world', so we thought... ooh that sounds interesting.\r\n [Rob]: What a challenge!  But how was it?\r\n [Neil]: It was insanely dangerous, I have to say!  It started at an altitude of almost 5,000 metres, so for a start it was very difficult to breathe.  Then there was this descent of over 3,500 metres down into the jungle.  And as if that wasn't enough, part of the ride was along a road that was so dangerous, it's actually known as 'the road of death'!  And on one side of this road there's a sheer drop of over a kilometre.  So it was pretty hair-raising stuff!\r\n [Rob]: I bet!\r\n [Neil]: I have a question for you, Rob.  We're talking about danger, so I would like to know which of these three countries the British government advises against all travel to.  Is it:\r\na) Iraq\r\n b) Somalia\r\n c) Afghanistan\r\n [Rob]: That's a tricky one, because all those countries have their problems, don't they.  I'm going to go for the middle one, a bit of a guess, Somalia.\r\n [Neil]: OK, well, we'll see at the end of the programme.  We have a story for you today which combines dangerous places with dangerous activities.  It's the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Can you tell us Rob what's going on there at the moment?\r\n [Rob]: Yes, elections are planned in the volatile country.  There are fears violence will break out as the country's been ravaged by decades of civil war.  It has amongst the lowest living standards in the world and has been described as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman because of the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.\r\n [Neil]: But despite its troubled history, it is actually a very beautiful country with amazing scenery and rich mineral resources.  And right now a very unusual - and possibly dangerous - tourist attraction has come into being.\r\n [Rob]: Oh really, what's that then?\r\n [Neil]: An erupting volcano.  Here's the BBC World Service reporter Chakuchanya Harawa.\r\n\r\n [Chakuchanya Harawa, BBC]\r\n Nature at its most violent often keeps tourists away.  But this volcano eruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo is proving an exception.  Since Nyamulagira began spewing out lava on 6 November rangers in Virunga National Park have set up a tented camp.  Hikers can safely watch the 300 m fountains of molten rock from a safe distance of 1.5 km.\r\n\r\n [Neil]: It sounds spectacular, doesn't it?\r\n [Rob]: It does.  The reporter said that lava was spewing out.\r\n [Neil]: People are apparently flocking to see this volcano.  You can get as close as 1.5 km away and watch it spew out fountains of molten rock which reach 300 metres in height.\r\n [Rob]: But surely it's at least a little bit dangerous to watch a live volcano from such close proximity?\r\n [Neil]: Yes, you'd think so, wouldn't you!  Well, in 2002 another volcano in the region destroyed parts of the city of Goma and forced 350,000 people to flee.  Here's the BBC's Chakuchanya Harawa again talking about how safe this volcano is.\r\n\r\n [Chakuchanya Harawa, BBC]\r\n It's a 3-4 hour hike to the camp, and a visit costs $300 per person.  Experts say the volcano doesn't currently pose a threat to tourists, the local population or the area's endangered mountain gorillas.  Rangers have, however, worked for years to protect the park from poachers, rebel groups, illegal miners and land invasions.\r\n\r\n [Neil]: So, according to the experts, the volcano doesn't pose a threat to tourists.\r\n [Rob]: Hmm, I wonder who these so-called experts are?!  The reporter said that the local population needn't worry and the endangered mountain gorillas are safe too.\r\n [Neil]: The gorillas are actually a major tourist attraction in themselves.  The area had no tourists in 2008 but the tourism industry's now growing so fast it expects to make $1million this year for the very first time.  But it's the volcano which is making some money.  As we've heard, $300 per person to see it.  Do you think you'd be tempted, Rob?\r\n [Rob]: Absolutely!  It's been my dream to get close to an erupting volcano – I'd go like a shot!\r\n [Neil]: Right, well, book a flight!\r\n [Rob]: OK, I will!\r\n [Neil]: Let's go back to the question at the beginning of the programme.  I asked which of these three countries the British government advises against all travel to.  Is it:\r\na) Iraq\r\n b) Somalia\r\n c) Afghanistan\r\n [Rob]: And I said Somalia.  So was I right?\r\n [Neil]: You were right, actually.  Did you know that answer, or was it just a guess?\r\n [Rob]: Well, I had heard that it was a lawless country, so I suspected that you shouldn't really go there at the moment.\r\n [Neil]: Well, yes, you were right.  Well, that's all we have time for in today's programme.  But do join us again for more 6 Minute English from bbclearningenglish.com.  Goodbye.\r\n [Rob]: Bye.\r\n\r\n Vocabulary and definitions\r\n —————————————\r\n\r\n sheer - completely vertical\r\n hair-raising - something so scary your hair stands up!\r\n volatile - something that can change suddenly and unexpectedly\r\n ravaged - harmed or damaged, nearly destroyed\r\n mineral resources - things that are found naturally in the earth, such as tin, salt, coal\r\n erupting volcano - a type of mountain which has hot melted rock, steam and ash bursting out of the top\r\n lava - the hot liquid rock which comes out of a volcano and becomes solid as it cools\r\n spewing out - pouring out quickly and in large quantities\r\n proximity - closeness\r\n to flee - to run away\r\n endangered - a person, animal or place that is in danger of being harmed or destroyed\r\n"

        "text":" He would win his liberty.  This jury was all wrong.  A higher court would say so.  It would reverse their verdict, and he knew it.  He turned to Steger, where the latter was having the clerk poll the jury, in the hope that some one juror had been over-persuaded, made to vote against his will.\r\n\r\n \"Is that your verdict?\"  he heard the clerk ask of Philip Moultrie, juror No. 1.\r\n\r\n \"It is,\" replied that worthy, solemnly.\r\n\r\n \"Is that your verdict?\"  The clerk was pointing to Simon Glassberg.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is that your verdict?\"  He pointed to Fletcher Norton.\r\n\r\n \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n So it went through the whole jury.  All the men answered firmly and clearly, though Steger thought it might barely be possible that one would have changed his mind.  The judge thanked them and told them that in view of their long services this night, they were dismissed for the term.  The only thing remaining to be done now was for Steger to persuade Judge Payderson to grant a stay of sentence pending the hearing of a motion by the State Supreme Court for a new trial.\r\n\r\n The Judge looked at Cowperwood very curiously as Steger made this request in proper form, and owing to the importance of the case and the feeling he had that the Supreme Court might very readily grant a certificate of reasonable doubt in this case, he agreed.  There was nothing left, therefore, but for Cowperwood to return at this late hour with the deputy sheriff to the county jail, where he must now remain for five days at least—possibly longer.\r\n\r\n The jail in question, which was known locally as Moyamensing Prison, was located at Tenth and Reed Streets, and from an architectural and artistic point of view was not actually displeasing to the eye.  It consisted of a central portion—prison, residence for the sheriff or what you will—three stories high, with a battlemented cornice and a round battlemented tower about one-third as high as the central portion itself, and two wings, each two stories high, with battlemented turrets at either end, giving it a highly castellated and consequently, from the American point of view, a very prison-like appearance.  The facade of the prison, which was not more than thirty-five feet high for the central portion, nor more than twenty-five feet for the wings, was set back at least a hundred feet from the street, and was continued at either end, from the wings to the end of the street block, by a stone wall all of twenty feet high.  The structure was not severely prison-like, for the central portion was pierced by rather large, unbarred apertures hung on the two upper stories with curtains, and giving the whole front a rather pleasant and residential air.  The wing to the right, as one stood looking in from the street, was the section known as the county jail proper, and was devoted to the care of prisoners serving short-term sentences on some judicial order.  The wing to the left was devoted exclusively to the care and control of untried prisoners.  The whole building was built of a smooth, light-colored stone, which on a snowy night like this, with the few lamps that were used in it glowing feebly in the dark, presented an eery, fantastic, almost supernatural appearance.\r\n\r\n It was a rough and blowy night when Cowperwood started for this institution under duress.  The wind was driving the snow before it in curious, interesting whirls.  Eddie Zanders, the sheriff's deputy on guard at the court of Quarter Sessions, accompanied him and his father and Steger.  Zanders was a little man, dark, with a short, stubby mustache, and a shrewd though not highly intelligent eye.  He was anxious first to uphold his dignity as a deputy sheriff, which was a very important position in his estimation, and next to turn an honest penny if he could.  He knew little save the details of his small world, which consisted of accompanying prisoners to and from the courts and the jails, and seeing that they did not get away.  He was not unfriendly to a particular type of prisoner—the well-to-do or moderately prosperous—for he had long since learned that it paid to be so.  To-night he offered a few sociable suggestions—viz., that it was rather rough, that the jail was not so far but that they could walk, and that Sheriff Jaspers would, in all likelihood, be around or could be aroused.  Cowperwood scarcely heard.  He was thinking of his mother and his wife and of Aileen.\r\n\r\n When the jail was reached he was led to the central portion, as it was here that the sheriff, Adlai Jaspers, had his private office.  Jaspers had recently been elected to office, and was inclined to conform to all outward appearances, in so far as the proper conduct of his office was concerned, without in reality inwardly conforming.  Thus it was generally known among the politicians that one way he had of fattening his rather lean salary was to rent private rooms and grant special privileges to prisoners who had the money to pay for the same.  Other sheriffs had done it before him.  In fact, when Jaspers was inducted into office, several prisoners were already enjoying these privileges, and it was not a part of his scheme of things to disturb them.  The rooms that he let to the \"right parties,\" as he invariably put it, were in the central portion of the jail, where were his own private living quarters.  They were unbarred, and not at all cell-like.  There was no particular danger of escape, for a guard stood always at his private door instructed \"to keep an eye\" on the general movements of all the inmates.  A prisoner so accommodated was in many respects quite a free person.  His meals were served to him in his room, if he wished.  He could read or play cards, or receive guests;  and if he had any favorite musical instrument, that was not denied him.  There was just one rule that had to be complied with.  If he were a public character, and any newspaper men called, he had to be brought down-stairs into the private interviewing room in order that they might not know that he was not confined in a cell like any other prisoner.\r\n\r\n Nearly all of these facts had been brought to Cowperwood's attention beforehand by Steger;  but for all that, when he crossed the threshold of the jail a peculiar sensation of strangeness and defeat came over him.  He and his party were conducted to a little office to the left of the entrance, where were only a desk and a chair, dimly lighted by a low-burning gas-jet.  Sheriff Jaspers, rotund and ruddy, met them, greeting them in quite a friendly way.  Zanders was dismissed, and went briskly about his affairs.\r\n\r\n \"A bad night, isn't it?\"  observed Jaspers, turning up the gas and preparing to go through the routine of registering his prisoner.  Steger came over and held a short, private conversation with him in his corner, over his desk which resulted presently in the sheriff's face lighting up.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, certainly, certainly!  That's all right, Mr. Steger, to be sure!  Why, certainly!\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood, eyeing the fat sheriff from his position, understood what it was all about.  He had regained completely his critical attitude, his cool, intellectual poise.  So this was the jail, and this was the fat mediocrity of a sheriff who was to take care of him.  Very good.  He would make the best of it.  He wondered whether he was to be searched—prisoners usually were—but he soon discovered that he was not to be.\r\n\r\n \"That's all right, Mr. Cowperwood,\" said Jaspers, getting up.  \"I guess I can make you comfortable, after a fashion.  We're not running a hotel here, as you know\"—he chuckled to himself—\"but I guess I can make you comfortable.  John,\" he called to a sleepy factotum, who appeared from another room, rubbing his eyes, \"is the key to Number Six down here?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n \"Let me have it.\"\r\n\r\n John disappeared and returned, while Steger explained to Cowperwood that anything he wanted in the way of clothing, etc., could be brought in.  Steger himself would stop round next morning and confer with him, as would any of the members of Cowperwood's family whom he wished to see.  Cowperwood immediately explained to his father his desire for as little of this as possible.  Joseph or Edward might come in the morning and bring a grip full of underwear, etc.;  but as for the others, let them wait until he got out or had to remain permanently.  He did think of writing Aileen, cautioning her to do nothing;  but the sheriff now beckoned, and he quietly followed.  Accompanied by his father and Steger, he ascended to his new room.\r\n\r\n It was a simple, white-walled chamber fifteen by twenty feet in size, rather high-ceiled, supplied with a high-backed, yellow wooden bed, a yellow bureau, a small imitation-cherry table, three very ordinary cane-seated chairs with carved hickory-rod backs, cherry-stained also, and a wash-stand of yellow-stained wood to match the bed, containing a washbasin, a pitcher, a soap-dish, uncovered, and a small, cheap, pink-flowered tooth and shaving brush mug, which did not match the other ware and which probably cost ten cents.  The value of this room to Sheriff Jaspers was what he could get for it in cases like this—twenty-five to thirty-five dollars a week.  Cowperwood would pay thirty-five.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood walked briskly to the window, which gave out on the lawn in front, now embedded in snow, and said he thought this was all right.  Both his father and Steger were willing and anxious to confer with him for hours, if he wished;  but there was nothing to say.  He did not wish to talk.\r\n\r\n \"Let Ed bring in some fresh linen in the morning and a couple of suits of clothes, and I will be all right.  George can get my things together.\"  He was referring to a family servant who acted as valet and in other capacities.  \"Tell Lillian not to worry.  I'm all right.  I'd rather she would not come here so long as I'm going to be out in five days.  If I'm not, it will be time enough then.  Kiss the kids for me.\"  And he smiled good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n After his unfulfilled predictions in regard to the result of this preliminary trial Steger was almost afraid to suggest confidently what the State Supreme Court would or would not do;  but he had to say something.\r\n\r\n \"I don't think you need worry about what the outcome of my appeal will be, Frank.  I'll get a certificate of reasonable doubt, and that's as good as a stay of two months, perhaps longer.  I don't suppose the bail will be more than thirty thousand dollars at the outside.  You'll be out again in five or six days, whatever happens.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood said that he hoped so, and suggested that they drop matters for the night.  After a few fruitless parleys his father and Steger finally said good night, leaving him to his own private reflections.  He was tired, however, and throwing off his clothes, tucked himself in his mediocre bed, and was soon fast asleep. \r\n\r\n Chapter XLV\r\n\r\n Say what one will about prison life in general, modify it ever so much by special chambers, obsequious turnkeys, a general tendency to make one as comfortable as possible, a jail is a jail, and there is no getting away from that.  Cowperwood, in a room which was not in any way inferior to that of the ordinary boarding-house, was nevertheless conscious of the character of that section of this real prison which was not yet his portion.  He knew that there were cells there, probably greasy and smelly and vermin-infested, and that they were enclosed by heavy iron bars, which would have as readily clanked on him as on those who were now therein incarcerated if he had not had the price to pay for something better.  So much for the alleged equality of man, he thought, which gave to one man, even within the grim confines of the machinery of justice, such personal liberty as he himself was now enjoying, and to another, because he chanced to lack wit or presence or friends or wealth, denied the more comfortable things which money would buy.\r\n\r\n The morning after the trial, on waking, he stirred curiously, and then it suddenly came to him that he was no longer in the free and comfortable atmosphere of his own bedroom, but in a jail-cell, or rather its very comfortable substitute, a sheriff's rented bedroom.  He got up and looked out the window.  The ground outside and Passayunk Avenue were white with snow.  Some wagons were silently lumbering by.  A few Philadelphians were visible here and there, going to and fro on morning errands.  He began to think at once what he must do, how he must act to carry on his buiness, to rehabilitate himself;  and as he did so he dressed and pulled the bell-cord, which had been indicated to him, and which would bring him an attendant who would build him a fire and later bring him something to eat.  A shabby prison attendant in a blue uniform, conscious of Cowperwood's superiority because of the room he occupied, laid wood and coal in the grate and started a fire, and later brought him his breakfast, which was anything but prison fare, though poor enough at that.\r\n\r\n After that he was compelled to wait in patience several hours, in spite of the sheriff's assumption of solicitous interest, before his brother Edward was admitted with his clothes.  An attendant, for a consideration, brought him the morning papers, and these, except for the financial news, he read indifferently.  Late in the afternoon Steger arrived, saying he had been busy having certain proceedings postponed, but that he had arranged with the sheriff for Cowperwood to be permitted to see such of those as had important business with him.\r\n\r\n By this time, Cowperwood had written Aileen under no circumstances to try to see him, as he would be out by the tenth, and that either that day, or shortly after, they would meet.  As he knew, she wanted greatly to see him, but he had reason to believe she was under surveillance by detectives employed by her father.  This was not true, but it was preying on her fancy, and combined with some derogatory remarks dropped by Owen and Callum at the dinner table recently, had proved almost too much for her fiery disposition.

        "text":"Santorini (officially Thira), is an island located in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast from Greece's mainland.  It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera.  It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 sq.  km (28 sq mi) and a 2001 census population of 13,670.  The municipality of Santorini comprises the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia and the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi, and Christiana.  The total land area is 90.623 sq.  km (34.990 sq mi).  Santorini is part of the Santorini peripheral unit.\r\n\r\n Santorini is essentially what remains after an enormous volcanic explosion that destroyed the earliest settlements, on a formerly single island, and created the current geological caldera.  A giant central, rectangular lagoon, which measures about 12 by 7 km (7.5 by 4.3 mi), is surrounded by 300 m (980 ft) high, steep cliffs on three sides.  The main island slopes downward to the Aegean Sea.  On the fourth side, the lagoon is separated from the sea by another much smaller island called Therasia;  the lagoon is connected to the sea in two places, in the northwest and southwest.  The water in the center of the lagoon is nearly 400 m (1,300 ft) deep, thus making it a safe harbor for all kinds of shipping.  The island's harbors all lie in the lagoon, and there are no ports on the perimeter of the island;  the capital, Fira, clings to the top of the cliff looking down on the lagoon.  The volcanic rocks present from the prior eruptions feature olivine and have a notably small presence of hornblende.\r\n\r\n It is the most active volcanic center in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, though what remains today is chiefly a water-filled caldera.  The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (310 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide.  The region first became volcanically active around 3–4 million years ago, though volcanism on Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around the Akrotiri.\r\n The island is the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which occurred some 3600 years ago at the height of the Minoan civilization.  The eruption left a large caldera surrounded by volcanic ash deposits hundreds of feet deep and may have led indirectly to the collapse of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete, 110 km (68 mi) to the south, through a gigantic tsunami.  This theory is not, however, supported by chronology, in that the collapse of the Minoan civilization did not occur at the date of the tsunami, but some 90 years later.  Another popular theory holds that the Thera eruption is the source of the legend of Atlantis.\r\n\r\n Santorini was named by the Latin Empire in the thirteenth century, and is a reference to Saint Irene, from the name of the old cathedal in the village of Perissa.  The name Thera was revived in the nineteenth century as the official name of the island and its main city, but the colloquial name Santorini is still in popular use.  During the Ottoman Empire's domination of the Aegean Sea, the Turkish exonym for the island was \"Santurin\" or \"Santoron\".\r\n"

This story is about Emmeline and it all happend a long time ago in a town that doesn't exist, at least, not anymore.\r\n  Emmeline was  three, the only child of a curator and soprano.  She had everything a child could want but there was one problem.  Emmeline had been forgotten by absolutely everyone.  Mummy and Daddy were always preoccupied with the business of the day.  The servants complaind that she was underfoot.  Even the postman, who brought letters that often made Daddy frown, never brought any letters for little Emmeline.  There were no hugs, no bedtime stories.  Anly a growing mountain of cold lifeless toys who could not scare away the closet monsters or admire her drawings or, most importantly, love her back.  Emmeline tried her best to be a good little girl.  Then she tried very hard to be not so good little girl.  Either way no one was paying attention.  There was nothing she could do.\r\n  One night Emmeline picked out of her bedroom window and saw a beautiful star!  It twinkled and glowed so brilliantly that Emmeline wondered if it was even a star at all and not an angel who was up past his bedtime.   She remembered a rhyme about such stars and how they could grant wishes.  And if anybody had a wish, it was Emmeline.  Emmeline closed her eyes and wished.  Wished.  Wished....with all her might.  She wished for a friend.  A friend who could play with her anf help her reach tall things and protect her from the creatures in the shadow and never ever ever leave... Stars don't grant wished for everyone, mind you, but few children ever wished for anything so dearly as little Emmeline.\r\n - Please.....-  She begged.\r\n - Pleeeeeease!\r\n And at the exact stroke of midnight, or perhaps a few second before, depending upon the clock, Emmeline's wish came true.\r\n\r\n   Oh, he was a delightful friend!  They drew pretty pictures together and made up stories.  They even had tea parties and built pillow forts.  Emmeline named him Mister Creazil.  Because it sounded right.  And he was her special secret. \r\n   Mister Creazil was great fun for a while, but after a time, it seemed there was something missing.  He was certainly the best friend she'd ever had but only because she wanted him to be.  He did everything she asked but nothing more.  He couldn't even love her on his own.  This thought made Emmeline very sad. \r\n  Then came the cound of cheering from the parlor, and soon after the news. \r\n - Oh, isn't it wonderful, Emmeline!?  - said one of those maids who never usually said anything to her. \r\n - You mother is going to have a baby!  You'll have a baby sister one day, won't that be nice?  - With that the maid was gone as quickly as she had come. \r\n Emmeline turned to Mister Creazil  who, after considering the proper answer, chose to frown.  No, this was not wonderful.  Not at all.  This was the final straw and Emmeline would not stand for it\r\n With her fists clenched at her sides and her face scarlet with rage she opend her mouth and screamed.  How DARE they replace her with a new child!  How DARE they love another little girl!  Emmeline screamed and screamed and couldn't stop screaming.  And as she screamed Mister Creazil absorbed her wrath and began to grow.  The more Emmeline screamed the bigger and uglier he becameuntil he outgrew the entire house!\r\n  With a terrifying roar Mister Creazil carried out the revenge Emmeline wanted more than ever. \r\n - Crack!

This gave her courage to do what she had long wanted to do, and that was to teach her father that she could get along without him and that he could not make her do anything she did not want to do.  She still had the two hundred dollars Cowperwood had given her and some additional cash of her own—perhaps three hundred and fifty dollars in all.  This she thought would be sufficient to see her to the end of her adventure, or at least until she could make some other arrangement for her personal well-being.  From what she knew of the feeling of her family for her, she felt that the agony would all be on their side, not hers.  Perhaps when her father saw how determined she was he would decide to let her alone and make peace with her.  She was determined to try it, anyhow, and immediately sent word to Cowperwood that she was going to the Calligans and would welcome him to freedom.\r\n\r\n In a way, Cowperwood was rather gratified by Aileen's message, for he felt that his present plight, bitter as it was, was largely due to Butler's opposition and he felt no compunction in striking him through his daughter.  His former feeling as to the wisdom of not enraging Butler had proved rather futile, he thought, and since the old man could not be placated it might be just as well to have Aileen demonstrate to him that she was not without resources of her own and could live without him.  She might force him to change his attitude toward her and possibly even to modify some of his political machinations against him, Cowperwood.  Any port in a storm—and besides, he had now really nothing to lose, and instinct told him that her move was likely to prove more favorable than otherwise—so he did nothing to prevent it.\r\n\r\n She took her jewels, some underwear, a couple of dresses which she thought would be serviceable, and a few other things, and packed them in the most capacious portmanteau she had.  Shoes and stockings came into consideration, and, despite her efforts, she found that she could not get in all that she wished.  Her nicest hat, which she was determined to take, had to be carried outside.  She made a separate bundle of it, which was not pleasant to contemplate.  Still she decided to take it.  She rummaged in a little drawer where she kept her money and jewels, and found the three hundred and fifty dollars and put it in her purse.  It wasn't much, as Aileen could herself see, but Cowperwood would help her.  If he did not arrange to take care of her, and her father would not relent, she would have to get something to do.  Little she knew of the steely face the world presents to those who have not been practically trained and are not economically efficient.  She did not understand the bitter reaches of life at all.  She waited, humming for effect, until she heard her father go downstairs to dinner on this tenth day of December, then leaned over the upper balustrade to make sure that Owen, Callum, Norah, and her mother were at the table, and that Katy, the housemaid, was not anywhere in sight.  Then she slipped into her father's den, and, taking a note from inside her dress, laid it on his desk, and went out.  It was addressed to \"Father,\" and read:\r\n\r\n Dear Father,—I just cannot do what you want me to.  I have made up my mind that I love Mr. Cowperwood too much, so I am going away.  Don't look for me with him.  You won't find me where you think.  I am not going to him;  I will not be there.  I am going to try to get along by myself for a while, until he wants me and can marry me.  I'm terribly sorry;  but I just can't do what you want.  I can't ever forgive you for the way you acted to me.  Tell mama and Norah and the boys good-by for me.  Aileen\r\n\r\n To insure its discovery, she picked up Butler's heavy-rimmed spectacles which he employed always when reading, and laid them on it.  For a moment she felt very strange, somewhat like a thief— a new sensation for her.  She even felt a momentary sense of ingratitude coupled with pain.  Perhaps she was doing wrong.  Her father had been very good to her.  Her mother would feel so very bad.  Norah would be sorry, and Callum and Owen.  Still, they did not understand her any more.  She was resentful of her father's attitude.  He might have seen what the point was;  but no, he was too old, too hidebound in religion and conventional ideas—he never would.  He might never let her come back.  Very well, she would get along somehow.  She would show him.  She might get a place as a school-teacher, and live with the Calligans a long while, if necessary, or teach music.\r\n\r\n She stole downstairs and out into the vestibule, opening the outer door and looking out into the street.  The lamps were already flaring in the dark, and a cool wind was blowing.  Her portmanteau was heavy, but she was quite strong.  She walked briskly to the corner, which was some fifty feet away, and turned south, walking rather nervously and irritably, for this was a new experience for her, and it all seemed so undignified, so unlike anything she was accustomed to doing.  She put her bag down on a street corner, finally, to rest.  A boy whistling in the distance attracted her attention, and as he drew near she called to him: \"Boy!  Oh, boy!\"\r\n\r\n He came over, looking at her curiously.\r\n\r\n \"Do you want to earn some money?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, ma'am,\" he replied politely, adjusting a frowsy cap over one ear.\r\n\r\n \"Carry this bag for me,\" said Aileen, and he picked it up and marched off.\r\n\r\n In due time she arrived at the Calligans', and amid much excitement was installed in the bosom of her new home.  She took her situation with much nonchalance, once she was properly placed, distributing her toilet articles and those of personal wear with quiet care.  The fact that she was no longer to have the services of Kathleen, the maid who had served her and her mother and Norah jointly, was odd, though not trying.  She scarcely felt that she had parted from these luxuries permanently, and so made herself comfortable.\r\n\r\n Mamie Calligan and her mother were adoring slaveys, so she was not entirely out of the atmosphere which she craved and to which she was accustomed. \r\n\r\n Chapter XLVI\r\n\r\n Meanwhile, in the Butler home the family was assembling for dinner.  Mrs. Butler was sitting in rotund complacency at the foot of the table, her gray hair combed straight back from her round, shiny forehead.  She had on a dark-gray silk dress, trimmed with gray-and-white striped ribbon.  It suited her florid temperament admirably.  Aileen had dictated her mother's choice, and had seen that it had been properly made.  Norah was refreshingly youthful in a pale-green dress, with red-velvet cuffs and collar.  She looked young, slender, gay.  Her eyes, complexion and hair were fresh and healthy.  She was trifling with a string of coral beads which her mother had just given her.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, look, Callum,\" she said to her brother opposite her, who was drumming idly on the table with his knife and fork.  \"Aren't they lovely?  Mama gave them to me.\"\r\n\r\n \"Mama does more for you than I would.  You know what you'd get from me, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n \"What?\"\r\n\r\n He looked at her teasingly.  For answer Norah made a face at him.  Just then Owen came in and took his place at the table.  Mrs. Butler saw Norah's grimace.\r\n\r\n \"Well, that'll win no love from your brother, ye can depend on that,\" she commented.\r\n\r\n \"Lord, what a day!\"  observed Owen, wearily, unfolding his napkin.  \"I've had my fill of work for once.\"\r\n\r\n \"What's the trouble?\"  queried his mother, feelingly.\r\n\r\n \"No real trouble, mother,\" he replied.  \"Just everything—ducks and drakes, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, ye must ate a good, hearty meal now, and that'll refresh ye,\" observed his mother, genially and feelingly.  \"Thompson\"—she was referring to the family grocer—\"brought us the last of his beans.  You must have some of those.\"\r\n\r\n \"Sure, beans'll fix it, whatever it is, Owen,\" joked Callum.  \"Mother's got the answer.\"\r\n\r\n \"They're fine, I'd have ye know,\" replied Mrs. Butler, quite unconscious of the joke.\r\n\r\n \"No doubt of it, mother,\" replied Callum.  \"Real brain-food.  Let's feed some to Norah.\"\r\n\r\n \"You'd better eat some yourself, smarty.  My, but you're gay!  I suppose you're going out to see somebody.  That's why.\"\r\n\r\n \"Right you are, Norah.  Smart girl, you.  Five or six.  Ten to fifteen minutes each.  I'd call on you if you were nicer.\"\r\n\r\n \"You would if you got the chance,\" mocked Norah.  \"I'd have you know I wouldn't let you.  I'd feel very bad if I couldn't get somebody better than you.\"\r\n\r\n \"As good as, you mean,\" corrected Callum.\r\n\r\n \"Children, children!\"  interpolated Mrs. Butler, calmly, looking about for old John, the servant.  \"You'll be losin' your tempers in a minute.  Hush now.  Here comes your father.  Where's Aileen?\"\r\n\r\n Butler walked heavily in and took his seat.\r\n\r\n John, the servant, appeared bearing a platter of beans among other things, and Mrs. Butler asked him to send some one to call Aileen.\r\n\r\n \"It's gettin' colder, I'm thinkin',\" said Butler, by way of conversation, and eyeing Aileen's empty chair.  She would come soon now—his heavy problem.  He had been very tactful these last two months—avoiding any reference to Cowperwood in so far as he could help in her presence.\r\n\r\n \"It's colder,\" remarked Owen, \"much colder.  We'll soon see real winter now.\"\r\n\r\n Old John began to offer the various dishes in order;  but when all had been served Aileen had not yet come.\r\n\r\n \"See where Aileen is, John,\" observed Mrs. Butler, interestedly.  \"The meal will be gettin' cold.\"\r\n\r\n Old John returned with the news that Aileen was not in her room.\r\n\r\n \"Sure she must be somewhere,\" commented Mrs. Butler, only slightly perplexed.  \"She'll be comin', though, never mind, if she wants to.  She knows it's meal-time.\"\r\n\r\n The conversation drifted from a new water-works that was being planned to the new city hall, then nearing completion;  Cowperwood's financial and social troubles, and the state of the stock market generally;  a new gold-mine in Arizona;  the departure of Mrs. Mollenhauer the following Tuesday for Europe, with appropriate comments by Norah and Callum;  and a Christmas ball that was going to be given for charity.\r\n\r\n \"Aileen'll be wantin' to go to that,\" commented Mrs. Butler.\r\n\r\n \"I'm going, you bet,\" put in Norah.\r\n\r\n \"Who's going to take you?\" "

        "text":" Although it was nearly eleven o'clock when he arrived at the Calligans', Aileen was not yet in bed.  In her bedroom upstairs she was confiding to Mamie and Mrs. Calligan some of her social experiences when the bell rang, and Mrs. Calligan went down and opened the door to Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n \"Miss Butler is here, I believe,\" he said.  \"Will you tell her that there is some one here from her father?\"  Although Aileen had instructed that her presence here was not to be divulged even to the members of her family the force of Cowperwood's presence and the mention of Butler's name cost Mrs.  Calligan her presence of mind.  \"Wait a moment,\" she said;  \"I'll see.\"\r\n\r\n She stepped back, and Cowperwood promptly stepped in, taking off his hat with the air of one who was satisfied that Aileen was there.  \"Say to her that I only want to speak to her for a few moments,\" he called, as Mrs. Calligan went up-stairs, raising his voice in the hope that Aileen might hear.  She did, and came down promptly.  She was very much astonished to think that he should come so soon, and fancied, in her vanity, that there must be great excitement in her home.  She would have greatly grieved if there had not been.\r\n\r\n The Calligans would have been pleased to hear, but Cowperwood was cautious.  As she came down the stairs he put his finger to his lips in sign for silence, and said, \"This is Miss Butler, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" replied Aileen, with a secret smile.  Her one desire was to kiss him.  \"What's the trouble darling?\"  she asked, softly.\r\n\r\n \"You'll have to go back, dear, I'm afraid,\" whispered Cowperwood.  \"You'll have everything in a turmoil if you don't.  Your mother doesn't know yet, it seems, and your father is over at my place now, waiting for you.  It may be a good deal of help to me if you do.  Let me tell you—\" He went off into a complete description of his conversation with Butler and his own views in the matter.  Aileen's expression changed from time to time as the various phases of the matter were put before her;  but, persuaded by the clearness with which he put the matter, and by his assurance that they could continue their relations as before uninterrupted, once this was settled, she decided to return.  In a way, her father's surrender was a great triumph.  She made her farewells to the Calligans, saying, with a smile, that they could not do without her at home, and that she would send for her belongings later, and returned with Cowperwood to his own door.  There he asked her to wait in the runabout while he sent her father down.\r\n\r\n \"Well?\"  said Butler, turning on him when he opened the door, and not seeing Aileen.\r\n\r\n \"You'll find her outside in my runabout,\" observed Cowperwood.  \"You may use that if you choose.  I will send my man for it.\"\r\n\r\n \"No, thank you;  we'll walk,\" said Butler.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood called his servant to take charge of the vehicle, and Butler stalked solemnly out.\r\n\r\n He had to admit to himself that the influence of Cowperwood over his daughter was deadly, and probably permanent.  The best he could do would be to keep her within the precincts of the home, where she might still, possibly, be brought to her senses.  He held a very guarded conversation with her on his way home, for fear that she would take additional offense.  Argument was out of the question.\r\n\r\n \"Ye might have talked with me once more, Aileen,\" he said, \"before ye left.  Yer mother would be in a terrible state if she knew ye were gone.  She doesn't know yet.  Ye'll have to say ye stayed somewhere to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n \"I was at the Calligans,\" replied Aileen.  \"That's easy enough.  Mama won't think anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n \"It's a sore heart I have, Aileen.  I hope ye'll think over your ways and do better.  I'll not say anythin' more now.\"\r\n\r\n Aileen returned to her room, decidedly triumphant in her mood for the moment, and things went on apparently in the Butler household as before.  But those who imagine that this defeat permanently altered the attitude of Butler toward Cowperwood are mistaken.\r\n\r\n In the meanwhile between the day of his temporary release and the hearing of his appeal which was two months off, Cowperwood was going on doing his best to repair his shattered forces.  He took up his work where he left off;  but the possibility of reorganizing his business was distinctly modified since his conviction.  Because of his action in trying to protect his largest creditors at the time of his failure, he fancied that once he was free again, if ever he got free, his credit, other things being equal, would be good with those who could help him most—say, Cooke & Co., Clark & Co., Drexel & Co., and the Girard National Bank—providing his personal reputation had not been too badly injured by his sentence.  Fortunately for his own hopefulness of mind, he failed fully to realize what a depressing effect a legal decision of this character, sound or otherwise, had on the minds of even his most enthusiastic supporters.\r\n\r\n His best friends in the financial world were by now convinced that his was a sinking ship.  A student of finance once observed that nothing is so sensitive as money, and the financial mind partakes largely of the quality of the thing in which it deals.  There was no use trying to do much for a man who might be going to prison for a term of years.  Something might be done for him possibly in connection with the governor, providing he lost his case before the Supreme Court and was actually sentenced to prison;  but that was two months off, or more, and they could not tell what the outcome of that would be.  So Cowperwood's repeated appeals for assistance, extension of credit, or the acceptance of some plan he had for his general rehabilitation, were met with the kindly evasions of those who were doubtful.  They would think it over.  They would see about it.  Certain things were standing in the way.  And so on, and so forth, through all the endless excuses of those who do not care to act.  In these days he went about the money world in his customary jaunty way, greeting all those whom he had known there many years and pretending, when asked, to be very hopeful, to be doing very well;  but they did not believe him, and he really did not care whether they did or not.  His business was to persuade or over-persuade any one who could really be of assistance to him, and at this task he worked untiringly, ignoring all others.\r\n\r\n \"Why, hello, Frank,\" his friends would call, on seeing him.  \"How are you getting on?\"\r\n\r\n \"Fine!  Fine!\"  he would reply, cheerfully.  \"Never better,\" and he would explain in a general way how his affairs were being handled.  He conveyed much of his own optimism to all those who knew him and were interested in his welfare, but of course there were many who were not.\r\n\r\n In these days also, he and Steger were constantly to be met with in courts of law, for he was constantly being reexamined in some petition in bankruptcy.  They were heartbreaking days, but he did not flinch.  He wanted to stay in Philadelphia and fight the thing to a finish—putting himself where he had been before the fire;  rehabilitating himself in the eyes of the public.  He felt that he could do it, too, if he were not actually sent to prison for a long term;  and even then, so naturally optimistic was his mood, when he got out again.  But, in so far as Philadelphia was concerned, distinctly he was dreaming vain dreams.\r\n\r\n One of the things militating against him was the continued opposition of Butler and the politicians.  Somehow—no one could have said exactly why—the general political feeling was that the financier and the former city treasurer would lose their appeals and eventually be sentenced together.  Stener, in spite of his original intention to plead guilty and take his punishment without comment, had been persuaded by some of his political friends that it would be better for his future's sake to plead not guilty and claim that his offense had been due to custom, rather than to admit his guilt outright and so seem not to have had any justification whatsoever.  This he did, but he was convicted nevertheless.  For the sake of appearances, a trumped-up appeal was made which was now before the State Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n Then, too, due to one whisper and another, and these originating with the girl who had written Butler and Cowperwood's wife, there was at this time a growing volume of gossip relating to the alleged relations of Cowperwood with Butler's daughter, Aileen.  There had been a house in Tenth Street.  It had been maintained by Cowperwood for her.  No wonder Butler was so vindictive.  This, indeed, explained much.  And even in the practical, financial world, criticism was now rather against Cowperwood than his enemies.  For, was it not a fact, that at the inception of his career, he had been befriended by Butler?  And what a way to reward that friendship!  His oldest and firmest admirers wagged their heads.  For they sensed clearly that this was another illustration of that innate \"I satisfy myself\" attitude which so regulated Cowperwood's conduct.  He was a strong man, surely—and a brilliant one.  Never had Third Street seen a more pyrotechnic, and yet fascinating and financially aggressive, and at the same time, conservative person.  Yet might one not fairly tempt Nemesis by a too great daring and egotism?  Like Death, it loves a shining mark.  He should not, perhaps, have seduced Butler's daughter;  unquestionably he should not have so boldly taken that check, especially after his quarrel and break with Stener.  He was a little too aggressive.  Was it not questionable whether—with such a record—he could be restored to his former place here?  The bankers and business men who were closest to him were decidedly dubious.\r\n\r\n But in so far as Cowperwood and his own attitude toward life was concerned, at this time—the feeling he had—\"to satisfy myself\"— when combined with his love of beauty and love and women, still made him ruthless and thoughtless.  Even now, the beauty and delight of a girl like Aileen Butler were far more important to him than the good-will of fifty million people, if he could evade the necessity of having their good-will.  Previous to the Chicago fire and the panic, his star had been so rapidly ascending that in the helter-skelter of great and favorable events he had scarcely taken thought of the social significance of the thing he was doing.  Youth and the joy of life were in his blood.  He felt so young, so vigorous, so like new grass looks and feels.  The freshness of spring evenings was in him, and he did not care. "
