        "text":" In fact, Amanda was a highly illogical and socially inappropriate choice for the heir to the House of Surak.\r\n\r\n The fact that Sarek, who is fully Vulcan, was not more strong-willed than him fails to make him feel better about the situation.  Unlike him, Sarek had thirty years to spend with his bondmate.\r\n\r\n Spock thinks of thirty years with Kirk and feels a strong surge of longing.  He thinks about arguing with Kirk during sex, about falling in sleep with Kirk in his arms and waking up to the sight of him.  He thinks of Kirk's looping their legs together under the table and winking at him.  He thinks of Kirk's speaking with his mouth full, which now it seems almost endearing rather than disgusting.  He wants all of this, and thirty years are not enough for him.\r\n\r\n But wishing is illogical.\r\n\r\n Applying several meditating techniques to bring order to his mind, Spock turns around toward his meditation rug when an object in his peripheral vision catches his eyes.  He turns back and freezes upon seeing the Cup of Eridae on his desk.\r\n\r\n He stares at it for six seconds, and slowly proceeds forward, not daring to look away.\r\n\r\n \"Bravo,\" says a familiar voice, and Spock's gaze snaps to Queen Helena, who is eyeing with interest Spock's collection of Vulcan artifacts and weapons.  \"It took you less time than I expected  —  and certainly less time than the other champions  —  to finish the third task.\"\r\n\r\n Spock knows he should be angry and irritated, but his relief and joy overwhelms his other emotions.  The tournament was not the fruit of his imagination.  Kirk was not the fruit of his imagination.  \"Less time, Your Highness?  It has been forty-two days.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, not at all, young man.  In the real world it has been merely\"  —  the queen glances at her pocket watch  —  \"fourteen minutes.  Time passes differently in here.”  She pauses.  “Quite a fascinating collection you have, Commander.\"\r\n\r\n Spock presses his lips into a thin line to prevent himself from saying what he thinks of Atenians.  \"Would you explain to me the meaning of this?  I had to spend forty-two days here, and for what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n The elderly woman examines Spock's lirpa.  \"You did not have to spend forty-two days here, Spock.  If you resolved the problem that was on your mind immediately after your arrival here, you would have been returned to the real world at once.  However, you are quite fortunate that it did not take you longer.  People were known to spend dozens of years in the Eridae's Maze.\"\r\n\r\n \"I do not understand.  What is the nature of the third task?\"\r\n\r\n The queen shifts her gray eyes to him.  \"Do you remember what I said about the Eridae?  We use it for more than tournaments.  The Cup of Eridae is semi-sentient.  It can read individuals' minds and souls and can help unravel their problems.  At the moment, we are not actually on your ship;  we are in the Eridae's Maze.  The surroundings and the people were created using your memories and emotions.  The purpose of the third task is for the champions to resolve the matter troubling them as quickly as possible.  As you were informed,  for every champion the task differs greatly.  For you, that was the test of courage  —  you had to find the courage to face your emotions.\"\r\n\r\n Spock raises an eyebrow, attempting to reign his temper in.  \"Your Highness, are you telling me that all of the champions have something troubling them?  I find it difficult to believe.\"\r\n\r\n The Queen's eyes acquire a distant expression.  \"All of us have our demons, Spock;  some of us simply are not aware of them.  Did you know that Captain Harris has a wife and a daughter on Earth?  He left them for the sake of a years-long exploration mission, and it was the hardest decision he ever made in his life.  He is plagued by doubt.  At the moment, he is exploring what might have been if he had resigned from Starfleet and stayed with them.  Perhaps he would have come to regret it, but perhaps not.  When he makes the final decision about his future  —  the decision based on the acquired knowledge  —  he will also leave the Maze.\"\r\n\r\n \"Indeed?\"  Spock says.  \"What about Captains Flinn and O'Mala?  They do not have families on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n She eyes him thoughtfully.  \"I see you are angry and are not convinced of the importance of the task.”  She sighs.  “Very well – I will tell you about the others, though those are not my secrets to tell.  Two years ago, Captain Flinn made the decision to leave a young woman from his crew to her death, and it haunts him to this very day.  The Eridae is making him relive that disastrous mission over and over and try to find another solution other than leaving her behind.  So far, Captain Flinn hasn't given up trying.  When he admits to himself that there really wasn't any other solution and comes to peace with his decision, he will leave the Maze, too.  His task is to learn to forgive himself.\r\n\r\n \"Captain O'Mala is from a very religious Irish family.  Because of his background, he is in deep denial about his homosexuality.  The day he admits the truth to himself and comes to peace with it, he will leave the Maze.\"  She looks at Spock.  \"Your problem was, in some ways, similar to Captain O'Mala's.  You had trouble admitting that you feel at all, much less feel love towards an individual you consider unsuitable for you.  Considering that you honor the Vulcan way of suppressing emotions, I am somewhat surprised that you were the first to finish the third task.”  She smiles.  “Congratulations, Spock.\"\r\n\r\n Spock stares at her, unable to believe her audacity.  He cannot believe that Atenians would have made him live in this imaginary world for years – suffer seeing McCoy's hands all over Kirk for years.\r\n\r\n Never before has he been more tempted to use one particular human expression.\r\n\r\n \"Live long and prosper, Your Highness,\" Spock says instead, and taking the cup, drinks the liquid in one gulp.\r\n\r\n When the world ceases whirling around him, he is standing on the pitch, surrounded by the crowd of cheering people.  Blinking through his feeling of surrealism, Spock searches the Enterprise's stands and feels a pang of doubt upon not seeing Kirk there.  Is this another test?\r\n\r\n \"Spock!\"\r\n\r\n He whirls around, and there is Kirk, bouncing in excitement by the exit of the pitch.  He is grinning from ear to ear.  Spock stares at him for a moment, taking him in, then strides toward him.\r\n\r\n \"And Commander Spock of the Enterprise wins the tournament!\"  the commentator announces.  The Enterprise's stands explode in an uproar, but Spock is not paying attention, because there is Kirk, who is his, only his, and if McCoy or anyone else ever shows even a slightest inclination of wishing to take Kirk away from him, Spock will snap that person’s neck.\r\n\r\n Kirk's eyes widen as he realizes what Spock is about to do, but he does not push him away when Spock pulls him close and kisses him greedily, thinking mine, mine, only mine.  Let them all see.\r\n\r\n Vaguely, he is aware that the crowd falls silent before going wild again, but it matters not, because Kirk is kissing him back, laughing and attempting to say something. "

        "text":"Alleg gave a mock snarl.  “Don’t help him bargain, boy.  I have the feeling this is going to be hard enough as it is.”\r\n I gave it a little thought.  “I suppose I could stay. . .  .”  I let myself trail off uncertainly.\r\n Alleg gave a knowing smile.  “But . .  .”\r\n “But I would ask for three things.”\r\n “Hmm, three things.”  He looked me up and down.  “Just like in one of the stories.”\r\n “It only seems right,” I urged.\r\n He gave a hesitant nod.  “I suppose it does.  And how long would you travel with us?”\r\n “Until no one objects to my leaving.”\r\n “Does anyone have any problem with this?”  Alleg looked around.\r\n “What if he asks for one of the wagons?”  Tim asked.  His voice startled me, harsh and rasping like two bricks grating together.\r\n “It won’t matter, as he’ll be traveling with us,” Alleg argued.  “They belong to all of us anyway.  And since he can’t leave unless we say so. . .  .”\r\n There were no objections.  Alleg and I shook hands and there was a small cheer.\r\n Kete held up her mug.  “To Kvothe and his songs!”  she said.  “I have a feeling he’ll be worth whatever he costs us.”\r\n Everyone drank, and I held up my own glass.  “I swear on my mother’s milk, none of you will ever make a better deal than the one you made with me tonight.”  This evoked a more enthusiastic cheer and everyone drank again.\r\n Wiping his mouth, Alleg looked me in the eye.  “So, what is the first thing you want from us?”\r\n I lowered my head.  “It’s a little thing really.  I don’t have a tent of my own.  If I’m going to be traveling with my family . .  .”\r\n “Say no more!”  Alleg waved his wooden mug like a king granting a boon.  “You’ll have my own tent, piled with furs and blankets a foot deep!”  He made a gesture over the fire to where Fren and Josh sat.  “Go set it up for him.”\r\n “That’s all right,” I protested.  “I can manage it myself.”\r\n “Hush, it’s good for them.  Makes them feel useful.  Speaking of which . .  .”  He made another gesture at Tim.  “Bring them out, would you?”\r\n Tim stood and pressed a hand to his stomach.  “I’ll do it in a quick minute.  I’ll be right back.”  He turned to walk off into the woods.  “I don’t feel very good.”\r\n “That’s what you get for eatin’ like you’re at a trough!”  Otto called after him.  He turned back to the rest of us.  “Someday he’ll realize he can’t eat more’n me and not feel sick afterward.”\r\n “Since Tim’s busy painting a tree, I’ll go get them,” Laren said with thinly veiled eagerness.\r\n “I’m on guard tonight,” Otto said.  “I’ll do it.”\r\n “I’ll get them,” Kete said, exasperated.  She stared the other two back into their seats and walked behind the wagon on my left.\r\n Josh and Fren came out of the other wagon with a tent, ropes, and stakes.  “Where do you want it?”  Josh asked.\r\n “That’s not a question you usually have to ask a man, is it, Josh?”  Fren joked, nudging his friend with an elbow.\r\n “I tend to snore,” I warned them.  “You’ll probably want me a little away from everyone else.”  I pointed.  “Over between those two trees would be fine.”\r\n “I mean, with a man, you normally know where they want it, don’t you, Josh?”  Fren continued as they wandered off and began to string up the tent.\r\n Kete returned a minute later, leading a pair of lovely young girls.  One had a lean body and face, with straight, black hair cut short like a boy’s.  The other was more generously rounded, with curling golden hair.  Both wore hopeless expressions and looked to be about sixteen.\r\n “Meet Krin and Ellie,” Kete said, gesturing to the girls.\r\n Alleg smiled.  “They are one of the ways in which Levinshir was generous to us.  Tonight, one of them will be keeping you warm.  My gift to you, as the new member in our family.”  He made a show of looking them over.  “Which one would you like?”\r\n I looked from one to the other.  “That’s a hard choice.  Let me think on it a little while.”\r\n Kete sat them near the edge of the fire and put a bowl of stew in each of their hands.  The girl with the golden hair, Ellie, ate woodenly for a few bites, then slowed to a stop like a toy winding down.  Her eyes looked almost blind, as if she were watching something none of us could see.  Krin’s eyes, on the other hand, were focused fiercely into the fire.  She sat stiffly with her bowl in her lap.\r\n “Girls,” Alleg chided.  “Don’t you know that things will get better as soon as you start cooperating?”  Ellie took another slow bite, then stopped.  Krin stared into the fire, her back stiff, her expression hard.\r\n From where she sat by the fire, Anne prodded at them with her wooden spoon.  “Eat!”  The response was the same as before.  One slow bite.  One tense rebellion.  Scowling, Anne leaned closer and gripped the dark-haired girl firmly by the chin, her other hand reaching for the bowl of stew.\r\n “Don’t,” I urged.  “They’ll eat when they get hungry enough.”  Alleg looked up at me curiously.  “I know what I’m talking about.  Give them something to drink instead.”\r\n The old woman looked for a moment as if she might continue anyway, then shrugged and let go of Krin’s jaw.  “Fine.  I’m sick of force-feeding this one anyway.  She’s been nothing but trouble.”\r\n Kete sniffed in agreement.  “Little bitch came at me when I untied her for her bath,” she said, brushing her hair away from the side of her face to reveal scratch marks.  “Almost took out my damn eye.”\r\n “Did a runner, too,” Anne said, still scowling.  “I’ve had to start doping her at night.”  She made a disgusted gesture.  “Let her starve if she wants.”\r\n Laren came back to the fire with two mugs, setting them in the girl’s unresisting hands.\r\n “Water?”  I asked.\r\n “Ale,” he said.  “It’ll be better for them if they aren’t eating.”\r\n I stifled my protest.  Ellie drank in the same vacant manner in which she had eaten.  Krin moved her eyes from the fire, to the cup, to me.  I felt an almost physical shock at her resemblance to Denna.  Still looking at me, she drank.  Her hard eyes gave away nothing of what was happening inside her head.\r\n “Bring them over to sit by me,” I said.  “It might help me to make up my mind.”\r\n Kete brought them over.  Ellie was docile.  Krin was stiff.\r\n “Be careful with this one,” Kete said, nodding to the dark-haired girl.  “She’s a scratcher.”\r\n Tim came back looking a little pale.  He sat by the fire where Otto nudged him with an elbow.  “Want some more stew?”  he asked maliciously.\r\n “Sod off,” Tim rasped weakly.\r\n “A little ale might settle your stomach,” I advised.\r\n He nodded, seeming eager for anything that might help him.  Kete fetched him a fresh mugful.\r\n By this time the girls were sitting on either side of me, facing the fire.  Closer, I saw things I had missed before.  There was a dark bruise on the back of Krin’s neck. "

I want you to do your job.\r\n Dr. House: Ah, yes, but as the philosopher Jagger once said, 'You can't always get what you want.'\r\n\r\n Dr. House: I'm angry!  You're risking a patient's life.\r\n Dr. Cuddy: I assume those are two separate points.\r\n\r\n Dr. House: You see that?  They all assume I'm a patient because of this cane.\r\n Dr. Wilson: Then why don't you put on a white coat like the rest of us?\r\n Dr. House: I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.\r\n\r\n Dr. House: Everybody lies.\r\n Dr. Cameron: Dr. House doesn't like dealing with patients.\r\n Dr. Foreman: Isn't treating patients why we became doctors?\r\n Dr. House: No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors.  Treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.\r\n\r\n Rebecca Adler: I just want to die with a little dignity.\r\n Dr. House: There's no such thing!  Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're even born, but it always happens and there's never any dignity in it.  I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass.  It's always ugly - always!  We can live with dignity - we can't die with it. \r\n\r\n Paternity (1.02)\r\n\r\n Dr. Chase: It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad.  If we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.\r\n Dr. House: Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.\r\n\r\n Dr. House: Thirty percent of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.\r\n Dr. Foreman: From what I've read false paternity is more like ten percent.\r\n Dr. House: That's what our moms would like us to believe.\r\n Dr. Cameron: Who cares?  If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?\r\n Dr. House: Fifty bucks says I'm right.\r\n Dr. Foreman: I'll take your money.\r\n Dr. House: Hit a nerve?  Don't worry, Foreman, I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.\r\n Dr. Foreman: Make that a hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n Dr. Cuddy: [leaving the hospital wearing a tennis outfit with a very short skirt] What are you doing back here?  A patient?\r\n Dr. House: No, a hooker.  Went to my office instead of my home.\r\n\r\n Dr. House: [talking to Wilson about a patient and quickly changing the subject as he sees Dr. Cuddy coming]  — the cutest little tennis outfit!  My God, I thought I was going to have a heart attack!  Oh my!  I didn't see you there - That is so embarrassing...\r\n Dr. Cuddy: How's your hooker doing?\r\n Dr. House: Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.\r\n\r\n Patient's Mother: How can you just sit there?\r\n Dr. House: If I eat standing up, I spill.\r\n\r\n Occam's Razor (1.03)\r\n\r\n Dr. House: [to the crowd in the walk-in clinic's waiting area] Hello, sick people and their loved ones!  In the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot of boring chitchat later, I'm Doctor Gregory House;  you can call me \"Greg.\"  I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.\r\n Dr. Cuddy: Short, sweet, grab a file.\r\n Dr. House: This ray of sunshine is Doctor Lisa Cuddy.  Doctor Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so unfortunately she's much too busy to deal with you.  I am a board [emphasized to sound like \"bored\"] ...certified diagnostician with a double specialty in infectious disease and nephrology.  I am also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is forced to be here against his will.\r\n [House turns to face Dr. Cuddy.]\r\n Dr. House: That is true, isn't it?\r\n [He turns back to the crowd.]\r\n Dr. House: But not to worry, because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.  Speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this.  [House reaches into his jacket and pulls out a pharmaceutical bottle.]  This is Vicodin.  It's mine.  You can't have any.  And no, I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem.  But who knows?  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.  So, who wants me?  [nobody moves] And who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?\r\n [Everybody raises their hands]\r\n Dr. House: Okay.  Well, I'll be in Exam Room One if you change your mind.\r\n\r\n Dr. House: What would you prefer - a doctor who holds your hand while you die or one who ignores you while you get better?  I suppose it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.\r\n\r\n Dr. Cameron: I'm uncomfortable about sex.\r\n Dr. Chase: Well, we don't have to talk about this...\r\n Dr. Cameron: Sex could kill you.  Do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex?  Pupils dilate, arteries constrict, core temperature rises, heart races, blood pressure skyrockets, respiration becomes rapid and shallow, the brain fires bursts of electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere, and secretions spit out of every gland, and the muscles tense and spasm like you're lifting three times your body weight.  It's violent, it's ugly and it's messy, and if God hadn't made it unbelievably fun, the human race would have died out eons ago.  [pause to breathe deep and stare at each other] Men are lucky they can only have one orgasm.  Do you know that women can have an hour long orgasm?\r\n [Foreman enters]\r\n Dr. Cameron: [grabs an apple and heads back to her seat] Hey, Foreman.\r\n\r\n Dr. Foreman: Occam's razor.  The simplest explanation is always the best.\r\n Dr. House: And you think one is simpler than two?\r\n Dr. Cameron: I'm pretty sure it is, yeah.\r\n Dr. House: Baby shows up.  Chase tells you that two people exchange fluids to create this being.  I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper.  Are you going to go with the two or the one?\r\n Dr. Foreman: I think your argument is specious.\r\n Dr. House: I think your tie is ugly.\r\n\r\n Patient's father: (to his wife about House) You're the one HE hasn't met.  (To House) How can you treat someone without meeting them?\r\n Dr. House: It's easy, when you don't give a crap about him.  *pauses* That's a good thing."

You jump off a bridge and you fall and fall, and then, just before you hit the ground or water, an elastic rope pulls you back.  In skysurfing you jump out of aeroplane and use a board to \"surf\" the air, doing gymnastics in mid-air!  And extreme sports on land can be just as dangerous.\r\n\r\n Winter sports have always an element of danger.  For example snowboarding, which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow, is more dangerous even than skiing.  Probably the most dangerous of all the new winter sports is snowrafting.  You sit in a rubber boat and sail down a mountain at great speed - and you can`t control the boat!\r\n\r\n Of course, water sports have always been fun.  Ice diving, for those people who are absolutely crasy.  You put on diving equipment and dive under a frosen lake.  And, if that`s not enough, you try to walk upside down on the ice!  I feel cold just thinking about it.\r\n\r\n A lot of people are not fit nowadays.  It`s a big problem today.  If you want to feel fit you'd better go in for one kind of sport or another.  I think that everyone must do all he can to be healthy.  Good health is better than the best medicine.  All kinds of physical exercises are very useful to make our bodies strong and to keep ourselves fit and healthy.  To tell the truth I don't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life.  In the morning I do some exercises just to awake.  In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful lake with pure water where my Granny lives.  In winter I swim in the swimming pool.  I like to ride the bike.  I shouldn't call myself a sports fan.  Of course, I like to watch sports competitions on TV, like hockey or football.  Also I admire skiing championships , biathlon, swimming.\r\n\r\n Doing sports a man become strong, healthy and gay.

This grips onto the road like a terrified toddler grips on to its mother's hand.  So, Lewis Hamilton, watch and learn.\r\n This is how you pass a Ferrari... without crashing into it.\r\n Oh, yes!\r\n\r\n One of the reasons the McLaren is so fast is its traction control system.  A system that really comes into its own in the rain.  It lets you drive hard, but it won't let you kill yourself.  And that is just the tip of a technological iceberg.\r\n There's a flap on the back which raises when you brake hard, so you can't see what's about to crash into the back of you. \r\n And then we get to the suspension.  A computer has replaced the anti-roll bars, so all four wheels are truly independent of one other.  This gives you better cornering and, more importantly, a better ride.\r\n\r\n Over the years, we've seen the Stig cutting this corner, putting two wheels on the grass to get the best possible lap times.  But if you ride a bump like that in the sort of hunkered-down, firmed-up cars that he drives... the jolt is horrific.  It's like being dipped in liquid nitrogen and then hit with a hammer.  You just sort of shatter.\r\n\r\n In the McLaren, though, it's a very different experience.\r\n\r\n There we go, two wheels off the track.\r\n You'd get more of a jolt if you drove a Rolls-Royce over a Jaffa cake.\r\n\r\n I've never driven a supercar that's even half as comfortable as this. \r\n Or as well-trimmed.\r\n It's all exquisite leather and stitching and beautiful graphics.\r\n It's a simple, elegant, a truly lovely place to sit.\r\n\r\n So, yes, in every scientific and mathematical way, this is better than a Ferrari 458.\r\n It'll even do 30 miles to the gallon.  But there's something missing, something that can't be measured, something you can't really put your finger on.\r\n There's no... zing.\r\n\r\n This is the factory where the McLaren is made.  'It's like a laboratory.  It's quiet, ordered, a magnesium and titanium Trappist world where perfection isn't quite good enough.\r\n It's very nice.\r\n But you can't imagine anyone here has ever put a whoopee cushion on the managing director's chair. \r\n\r\n You sense this lack of joy when you're behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n When you drive a Lamborghini, it's like you're operating a horse with some mustard\r\n stuck up its bottom, but when you drive this, it's like you're operating the sort of machine they use, I imagine, in ophthalmic surgery.\r\n\r\n We see the same problem with the way the McLaren looks.\r\n There's nothing wrong with it, but there's no art.  You get the sense it was styled by software and shaped by science.  Which it probably was.\r\n\r\n I'll give you another example.  You can turn the traction control off, but it'd be easier to launch the missiles from a nuclear submarine.  You have to push that button and hold it down for 10 seconds, then you push those two simultaneously, and I said to one of the engineers, \"Why does it have to be so complicated?\"  He said, \"Why would you want to turn the traction control off?\"\r\n I said, \"Well, it'd be fun.\"  And you could see him thinking, \"Hmm, fun?  I must look that up\r\n in a dictionary.\"\r\n\r\n 'The McLaren, then, is like a pair of tights.  Very practical and very sensible.\r\n 'The Ferrari, though, that is a pair of stockings.\r\n\r\n [DIALOGUE]\r\n\r\n [May] - What are you on about?\r\n\r\n [Clarkson] - Well, tights and stockings are designed to do exactly the same job.  But they don't.\r\n\r\n [May] - I don't know, I only wear socks, Jeremy.\r\n\r\n [Hammond] - Can we just move on from the hosiery, chaps, back to the car?  Is the ride really that good?\r\n\r\n [Clarkson] - Like a Rolls-Royce.  Unbelievably smooth.\r\n\r\n [May] - And do you know why?  Wasn't developed at the Nurburgring.\r\n\r\n [Hammond] - Oh, God, he's off again.\r\n\r\n [Clarkson] - True fact, it was developed, actually, at the Top Gear test track, this car was, so it should be able to set a blisteringly fast lap time.  Of course, to find out we have to give it to our racing driver.  Some say that he refuses to acknowledge the existence of Nottinghamshire.  And that he recently received a very strong e-mail from his fiancee's mother saying it's bad manners to sit at the dinner table in a helmet.  All we know is he's called the Stig!\r\n\r\n And it's off.\r\n MP4-12C may sound like a fax machine, 'but this car is fast, no doubt about that.\r\n Double clutch gearbox shifting seamlessly, going through the first corner, no dramas whatsoever, Stig listening to ABBA in Spanish, very weird.  Almost as weird as the way it takes Chicago, strangely calm, that.  Squirrelly under-braking into Hammerhead.  Now the meat of the corner,\r\nand it's regained its composure completely.  McLaren have actually been fiddling with the car since I drove it, so the ones you buy will have a sharper throttle.  And more noise.  OK, follow-through, a chance to really open up the twin-turbo V8.  How much is he going to clip the corner?  A lot, but he won't have felt a thing.  Just two corners to go now, air brake helping out there, tyres squealing, only Gambon left.  Millimetrically perfect, and there he is, across the line!\r\n\r\n Now...OK.\r\n\r\n Here is the Ferrari 458, 1.19.1.\r\n The Ferrari Enzo 1.90.\r\n The MP4-12C, 1.16.2.\r\n\r\n It is the second fastest car we've ever had here!"

        "text":"Blyad\r\n\r\n literally, “whore.”  This word is usually encountered in its contracted form “blya,” a particle used mainly for emphasis, adding a touch of lurid color at the end of absolutely any phrase.  “Ty chyo, blya?”  (What the fuck are you doing/saying?)  could be an act of friendly raillery or the verbal prelude to a headbutt.  The B-word is also a common cri-de-coeur: you stub your toe  —  “Blya!”  Some people are so addicted that they use the word to season even the most banal utterance.  Eg.  “A on, blya, mne skazal, blya, chto ya, blya...” This is the meat in the dumpling of Russian mat  —  it’s impossible to imagine a conversation with a taxi driver without it.\r\n\r\n Khui\r\n\r\n literally, “cock.”  The first thing after “hello” that people learn how to say in a foreign language is “fuck off,” and some manage to get by thereafter on these two phrases alone.  “Idi na khui!”  is the Russian equivalent, literally meaning “Go to the penis!”  Yes, I know it sounds silly in translation.  But what makes the system of Russian mat so interesting are the derivatives.  “Okhuyet” is to be extremely surprised, like when you see your friend Vasya puking in the gutter.  He would then report to be feeling “khuyovo.”  Also worth remembering are “Ni khuya sebe!”   —  “No fucking way!”  and the derivative “khuinya”  —  bollocks, bullshit.\r\n\r\n Pizda\r\n\r\n literally, “cunt.”  If you’re tired of sending people to the penis, you can send them “v pizdu” for the sake of variety.  Derivatives abound from this particularly crude item: your new mobile you might describe as “pizdaty,” or if you doubt the truth of a statement, you could say “Chyo ty pizdish?”   —  “Why are you talking through your...?”  Well, you know what.  Perhaps the most useful incarnation of this word is “pizdets,” meaning a “total fuck up.”  The phrase “Eto prosto pizdets!”  expresses the sublime degree of misery, a predicament where things can get no worse.  Anyone been to Kaluga?\r\n\r\n Mudak\r\n\r\n literally, “testicle.”  This word is never used in its original meaning, but has come into common currency to mean an “asshole” or “dickhead,” i.e. a man you find disagreeable.  This word is at the softcore end of the mat spectrum, but a phrase like “on polny mudak,” is still a dire condemnation of anyone it is used to denote.  When a shapka-wearing Volga driver cuts you off on the Garden Ring, “mudak!”  is what you shout out of your window at him.  A younger “mudak” could be tenderly referred to as a “mudachok,” while an adult male could also be termed a “mudilo”  —  a particularly unpleasant subspecies of the “mudak.”\r\n\r\n Yebat\r\n\r\n literally, “to fuck.”  This verb has all the primary meanings you’d expect it to have, with a couple of juicy extras unknown to English.  “Zaebat” means to exhaust, to make sick of.  “On menya zaebal!”  means “I’m sick to fucking death of him.”  For the virtuoso mat-user, “vyebyvatsya” means to show off in some crass or reprehensible way, and for me always conjures up the image of elitny hairdresser Sergey Zveryev.  To fuck someone up is “otyebat,” and the reflexive form “otyebis!”  means “get the fuck away from me!”  Also, “zayebis!”  is a nice mat variant of “khorosho” or “kruto.”  For example, “Vsyo zayebis!”   —  “Everything’s fucking great!”\r\n\r\n Srat\r\n\r\n literally, “to shit.”  This word has spawned a mass of colorful derivatives.  An enduring favorite is “zasranets”  —  a pest, often used affectionately.  “Obosratsya” literally means to shit oneself, but is most often employed to mean “to fuck up” i.e. “to make an embarassing mistake.”  To criticize something savagely is “obsirat”  —  to shit all over it.  “Chto ty nashu stranu obsirayesh?”  is a phrase heard by any foreigner who has ever tried to argue with a Russian nationalist.  The verb “prosrat’” is an obscene version of “to lose.”  “Opyat nashi prosrali” is what people say after seeing the Russian football team play.\r\n\r\n A combination of the above.\r\n\r\n The ur-text of Russian mat is, needless to say, the lyrics of Leningrad.  The song “Den Rozhdeniya” from the album “Dachniki” culminates in the impressive riff, “Vse zayebalo!  Pizdets na khui blyad!”  roughly translatable as “Fuck it all!  Fucking load of bullshit!”  In the song, this phrase is the mournful outburst of a man so weary of life that he doesn’t even want to celebrate his birthday.  Other permutations like “Idi v pizdu, blya, mudak” are also possible.  Warning: if English swearing is like beer, Russian mat is like vodka  —  it’s effect is stronger and foreigners should be wary when using it.  Take your lead from your interlocutor: if they use mat, then you can too."

Besides, you can’t possibly. . .  .”\r\n I gave him a frank look.\r\n “Well,” he hedged, “Even if you can, it . .  .”\r\n “This is the second thing I ask for,” I said formally.  “Both of them.”\r\n Otto made a cry of protest that was echoed in the expressions of Gaskin and Laren.\r\n I smiled reassuringly at them.  “Only for tonight.”\r\n Fren and Josh came back from setting up my tent.  “Be thankful he didn’t ask for you, Otto,” Fren said to the big man.  “That’s what Josh would have asked for, isn’t it Josh?”\r\n “Shut your hole, Fren,” Otto said, exasperated.  “Now I feel ill.”\r\n I stood and slung my lute over one shoulder.  Then I led both lovely girls, one golden and one dark, toward my tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-ONE Black by Moonlight\r\n Fren and Josh had done a good job with the tent.  It was tall enough to stand in the center, but still crowded with me and both girls standing.  I gave the golden-haired one, Ellie, a gentle push toward the bed of thick blankets.  “Sit down,” I said gently.\r\n When she didn’t respond, I took her by the shoulders and eased her into a sitting position.  She let herself be moved, but her blue eyes were wide and vacant.  I checked her head for any signs of a wound.  Not finding any, I guessed she was in deep shock.\r\n I took a moment and dug through my travel sack, then shook some powdered leaf into my traveling cup and added some water from my waterskin.  I set the cup into Ellie’s hands, and she took hold of it absently.  “Drink it,” I encouraged, trying to capture the tone of voice Felurian had used to gain my thoughtless compliance from time to time.\r\n It may have worked, or perhaps she was just thirsty.  Whatever the reason, Ellie drained the cup to the bottom.  Her eyes still held the same faraway look they had before.\r\n I shook another measure of the powdered leaf into the cup, refilled it with water, and held it out for the dark-haired girl to drink.\r\n We stayed there for several minutes, my arm outstretched, her arms motionless at her sides.  Finally she blinked, her eyes focusing on me.  “What did you give her?”  she asked.\r\n “Crushed velia,” I said gently.  “It’s a countertoxin.  There was poison in the stew.”\r\n Her eyes told me she didn’t believe me.  “I didn’t eat any of the stew.”\r\n “It was in the ale too.  I saw you drink that.”\r\n “Good,” she said.  “I want to die.”\r\n I gave a deep sigh.  “It won’t kill you.  It’ll just make you miserable.  You’ll throw up and be weak with muscle cramps for a day or two.”  I raised the cup, offering it to her.\r\n “Why do you care if they kill me?”  she asked tonelessly.  “If they don’t do it now they’ll do it later.  I’d rather die. . .  .”  She clenched her teeth before she finished the sentence.\r\n “They didn’t poison you.  I poisoned them and you happened to get some of it.  I’m sorry, but this will help you over the worst of it.”\r\n Krin’s gaze wavered for a second, then became iron hard again.  She looked at the cup, then fixed her gaze on me.  “If it’s harmless, you drink it.”\r\n “I can’t,” I explained.  “It would put me to sleep, and I have things to do tonight.”\r\n Krin’s eyes darted to the bed of furs laid out on the floor of the tent.\r\n I smiled my gentlest, saddest smile.  “Not those sorts of things.”\r\n She still didn’t move.  We stood there for a long while.  I heard a muted retching sound from off in the woods.  I sighed and lowered the cup.  Looking down, I saw Ellie had already curled up and gone to sleep.  Her face looked almost peaceful.\r\n I took a deep breath and looked back up at Krin.  “You don’t have any reason to trust me,” I said, looking straight into her eyes.  “Not after what has happened to you.  But I hope you will.”  I held out the cup again.\r\n She met my eyes without blinking, then reached for the cup.  She drank it off in one swallow, choked a little, and sat down.  Her eyes stayed hard as marble as she stared at the wall of the tent.  I sat down, slightly apart from her.\r\n In fifteen minutes she was asleep.  I covered the two of them with a blanket and watched their faces.  In sleep they were even more beautiful than before.  I reached out to brush a strand of hair from Krin’s cheek.  To my surprise, she opened her eyes and stared at me.  Not the marble stare she had given me before, she looked at me with the dark eyes of a young Denna.\r\n I froze with my hand on her cheek.  We watched each other for a second.  Then her eyes drew closed again.  I couldn’t tell if it was the drug pulling her under, or her own will surrendering to sleep.\r\n I settled myself at the entrance of the tent and lay Caesura across my knees.  I felt rage like a fire inside me, and the sight of the two sleeping girls was like a wind fanning the coals.  I set my teeth and forced myself to think of what had happened here, letting the fire burn fiercely, letting the heat of it fill me.  I drew deep breaths, tempering myself for what was to come.\r\n\r\n I waited for three hours, listening to the sounds of the camp.  Muted conversation drifted toward me, shapes of sentences with no individual words.  They faded, mixing with cursing and sounds of people being ill.  I took long, slow breaths as Vashet had shown me, relaxing my body, slowly counting my exhalations.\r\n Then, opening my eyes, I looked at the stars and judged the time to be right.  I slowly unfolded myself from my sitting position and made a long, slow stretch.  There was a solid crescent of moon hanging in the sky, and everything seemed very bright.\r\n I approached the campfire slowly.  It had fallen to sullen coals that did little to light the space between the two wagons.  Otto was there, his huge body slumped against one of the wheels.  I smelled vomit.  “Is that you, Kvothe?”  he asked blurrily.\r\n “Yes,” I continued my slow walk toward him.\r\n “That bitch Anne didn’t let the lamb cook through,” he moaned.  “I swear to holy God I’ve never been this sick before.”  He looked up at me.  “Are you all right?”\r\n Caesura leapt, caught the moonlight briefly on her blade, and tore his throat.  He staggered to one knee, then toppled to his side, his hands staining black as they clutched his neck.  I left him bleeding darkly in the moonlight, unable to cry out, dying but not dead.\r\n I tossed a piece of brittle iron into the coals of the fire and headed toward the other tents.\r\n Laren startled me as I came around the wagon.  He made a surprised noise as he saw me walk around the corner with my naked sword.  But the poison had made him sluggish, and he had barely managed to raise his hands before Caesura took him in the chest.  He choked a scream as he fell backward, writhing on the ground.\r\n None of them had been sleeping soundly due to the poison, so Laren’s cry set them pouring from the wagons and tents, staggering and looking around wildly.  Two indistinct shapes that I knew must be Josh and Fren leapt from the open back of the wagon closest to me.  I struck one in the eye before he hit the ground and tore the belly from the other.\r\n Everyone saw, and now there were screams in earnest.  Most of them began to run drunkenly into the trees, some falling as they went.  But the tall shape of Tim hurled itself at me.  The heavy sword he had been sharpening all evening glinted silver in the moonlight.\r\n But I was ready.  I slid a second long, brittle piece of sword-iron into my hand and muttered a binding.  Then, just as he came close enough to strike I snapped the iron sharply between my fingers.  His sword shattered with the sound of a broken bell, and the pieces tumbled and disappeared in the dark grass.\r\n Tim was more experienced than me, stronger, and with longer reach.  Even poisoned and with half a sword he made a good showing of himself.  It took me nearly half a minute before I snuck past his guard with Lover Out the Window and severed his hand at the wrist.\r\n He fell to his knees, letting out a raspy howl and clutching at the stump.  I struck him high in the chest and headed for the trees.  The fight hadn’t taken long, but every second was vital, as the others were already scattering into the woods.\r\n I hurried in the direction I’d seen one of the dark shapes stagger.  I was careless, so when Alleg threw himself on me from the shadow of a tree he caught me unaware.  He didn’t have a sword, only a small knife flashing in the moonlight as he dove for me.  But a knife is enough to kill a man.  He stabbed me in the stomach as we rolled to the ground.  I struck the side of my head against a root and tasted blood.\r\n I fought my way to my feet before he did and cut the hamstring on his leg.  Then I stabbed him in the stomach and left him cursing on the ground as I went to hunt the others.  I held one hand tight across my stomach.  I knew the pain would hit me soon, and after that I might not have long to live.\r\n\r\n It was a long night, and I will not trouble you with any further details.  I found all the rest of them as they made their way through the forest.  Anne had broken her leg in her reckless flight, and Tim made it nearly half a mile despite the loss of his hand and the wound in his chest.  They shouted and cursed and begged for mercy as I stalked them through the forest, but nothing they said could appease me.\r\n It was a terrible night, but I found them all.  There was no honor to it, no glory.  But there was justice of a sort, and blood, and in the end I brought their bodies back.\r\n\r\n I came back to my tent as the sky was beginning to color to a familiar blue.  A sharp, hot line of pain burned a few inches below my navel, and I could tell from the unpleasant tugging when I moved that dried blood had matted my shirt to the wound. "

        "text":"Map\r\n Maps are a kind of associative container that stores elements formed by the combination of a key value and a mapped value.\r\n\r\n In a map, the key value is generally used to uniquely identify the element, while the mapped value is some sort of value associated to this key.  Types of key and mapped value may differ.  For example, a typical example of a map is a telephone guide where the name is the key and the telephone number is the mapped value.\r\n\r\n Internally, the elements in the map are sorted from lower to higher key value following a specific strict weak ordering criterion set on construction.\r\n\r\n As associative containers, they are especially designed to be efficient accessing its elements by their key (unlike sequence containers, which are more efficient accessing elements by their relative or absolute position). \r\n\r\n Therefore, the main characteristics of a map as an associative container are:\r\nUnique key values: no two elements in the map have keys that compare equal to each other.  For a similar associative container allowing for multiple elements with equivalent keys, see multimap.\r\n Each element is composed of a key and a mapped value.  For a simpler associative container where the element value itself is its key, see set.\r\n Elements follow a strict weak ordering at all times.  Unordered associative arrays, like unordered_map, are available in implementations following TR1.\r\n\r\n Maps are also unique among associative containers in that they implement the direct access operator (operator[]) which allows for direct access of the mapped value.\r\n\r\n In their implementation in the C++ Standard Template Library, map containers take four template parameters:\r\n1 template < class Key, class T, class Compare = less,\r\n2 class Allocator = allocator > class map;\r\n\r\n Where the template parameters have the following meanings:\r\nKey: Type of the key values.  Each element in a map is uniquely identified by its key value.\r\n T: Type of the mapped value.  Each element in a map is used to store some data as its mapped value.\r\n Compare: Comparison class: A class that takes two arguments of the key type and returns a bool.  The expression comp(a,b), where comp is an object of this comparison class and a and b are key values, shall return true if a is to be placed at an earlier position than b in a strict weak ordering operation.  This can either be a class implementing a function call operator or a pointer to a function (see constructor for an example).  This defaults to less, which returns the same as applying the less-than operator (a or [] can be used, for example:\r\n\r\n1 it->first;    // same as (*it). first (the key value)\r\n 2 it->second;   // same as (*it). second  (the mapped value)"

        "text":"Phil Inkley has fled civilisation to escape electromagnetic fields, which he believes cause nosebleeds, headaches, convulsions and blackouts.  Laura Page meets him and investigates the condition known as 'electromagnetic hypersensitivity'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n It takes me seven phone calls and five attempts on Skype before I manage to hold a conversation with Phil Inkley.  When I visit him a week later I see that the wire from his laptop dangles precariously through his caravan window and over a few metres of wet woodland to a dongle concealed in a box in the far corner of the land.  Sometimes it works.\r\n\r\n After our conversations are repeatedly abandoned because of interference and delays, Phil cycles six miles to the nearest phone box.  It is out of order.  The next box contains no phone.  Phil texts from a mobile phone he seldom dares to use to tell me the situation and adds: \"You can see I'm not just physically isolated from people, it's very difficult to speak to them remotely too.\"\r\n\r\n For Phil, it is this isolation which is one of the most difficult aspects of suffering from self-diagnosed electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS).  Daily symptoms include nosebleeds, headaches, heart palpitations, lethargy and tinnitus.  Electro-hypersensitive people attribute such symptoms to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) such as those emitted by Wi-Fi, mobile phones, DECT phones and certain light sources, and say symptoms worsen with close proximity.\r\n\r\n Phil's illness is totally dominating his life.  He now lives in a caravan in the woods in Hampshire in an attempt to distance himself from EMFs.  He is constantly worried that he will be asked to move on.  When symptoms have been really bad he has retreated further into the forest, at one point living in an abandoned children's den and cooking on an open fire.\r\n\r\n \"I've been through hellishly desperate times with this,\" he says.  \"People don't believe that EMFs are the cause of EHS and it gets you in such a state.  You're battling for your existence and people think it's all in your head.\"  He breaks down in tears, not for the last time during our interview.  The strain of his situation is taking its toll.\r\n\r\n Solitary as Phil's suffering seems, he is not alone.  Estimates of the prevalence of EHS in the developed world vary, but most surveys indicate somewhere between 2% and 5%.  The best-known sufferer is Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway, medical doctor and former director general of the World Health Organisation.  She brought EHS into the mainstream when she said she was sensitive to radio waves from mobile phones in 2002.  She was accused by some of scaremongering, and there is debate over whether she jumped or was pushed from the WHO.  Either way, to the consternation of campaign groups, she has now gone quiet on the subject.\r\n\r\n Phil says he first experienced symptoms around the time that Wi-Fi came along.  He had been working as a sound technician and, being from a \"techy\" background, regularly fixed computers for family and friends.  After a day working around strong Wi-Fi he would feel pressure at his temples and fluttering pains in his chest.\r\n\r\n It was when he encountered the very same symptoms tuning in a hands-free phone kit for his dad that he began searching for an explanation.  \"I looked online at some reports about EHS from independent scientists.  I didn't like what I was reading so tried to leave it [EMFs] alone,\" he says.\r\n\r\n While EHS is not very well understood, the probability of any serious health risks from EMFs have been widely rebutted by the WHO, national radiation authorities, the mobile phone industry and the majority of researchers.\r\n\r\n There have been a number of studies testing the role of EMFs in causing EHS.  Sufferers were exposed to EMFs similar to those that they attributed to the cause of their symptoms under single- or double-blind conditions.  Most of these studies indicated that EHS individuals could not detect EMF exposure any more accurately than non-EHS individuals.  A 2005 review of 31 of the experiments stated that EHS is unrelated to the presence of EMFs, but said that more research was required.\r\n\r\n Some researchers have postulated that one possibility for the results is that subjects expected a negative effect and so experienced one, and that this can be expanded to explain why EHS sufferers feel symptoms when near to EMFs more generally.  Another theory is that there are some other physical causes such as flickering lights or problems with visual display units (VDUs).\r\n\r\n However, the methodology and analysis of the studies have been questioned by EHS sufferers, campaigners and some scientists.  There have been claims that the studies were influenced by the huge political and financial implications of a link being found, a view backed by Prof Andrew Marino at Louisiana State University, whose own research does suggest links between mobile phone radiation and illness.  He criticised the studies, saying they were sponsored by the communications companies Telenor and NetCom.  Researchers have denied they were influenced in any way.\r\n\r\n Phil is in firm agreement with those who believe that politics are at play.  When I express doubt over the conspiracy theories, he reminds me that the tobacco industry managed to cover up the dangers of smoking for 40 years with apparent backing from the establishment.\r\n\r\n He also compares current feelings about EHS to those about ME and Gulf war syndrome in the past - illnesses that were said not to really exist or be purely psychological and that, while still not fully understood, are now taken much more seriously.\r\n\r\n ask him if he has considered that his symptoms could have a psychological cause.\r\n\r\n \"I wanted to believe I was going mad.  It would have been easier,\" he says.  \"But I knew I wasn't.  I hoped for a while that the gas boiler was leaking carbon monoxide and giving me headaches and that I was imagining the rest.  But it wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n After Phil's illness started to worsen to include convulsions and blackouts he began to ask for help, but does not feel he has received any.\r\n\r\n \"I was getting really scared about what was happening to me but I thought, 'This is England.  I'll just get in touch with the authorities and explain and they'll sort it out.'  That's how naive I was.\"\r\n\r\n Phil's GP simply informed him that there was no convincing evidence that electromagnetic radiation has any detrimental health effects.  He then contacted the Health Protection Agency, leaving several messages, but no one ever got back to him - until he received a voicemail telling him not to call again.\r\n\r\n In 2005 the HPA reported that considering only whether electromagnetic radiation was a causative factor was not meeting the needs of sufferers, although continued research in this area was essential.  Whatever the cause, EHS symptoms are real and they can be severe and extremely disabling.  Sufferers are not getting the support they need.\r\n\r\n Phil describes his condition as \"living in a nuclear war\".  He asks: \"Can you imagine what it's like when your environment becomes so aggressive to your health?\"  His voice trembles and he looks desperate.\r\n\r\n Phil could certainly do with moral support and financial help to stop him slipping further towards the edge of society.  But what he really wants is for people to believe he is right about the causes of EHS.  He'd like more independent studies to be undertaken and seriously considered.\r\n\r\n It is not clear whether more studies will be conducted in the near future.  It's even less clear that they will ever yield the results he is looking for."

        "text":"Saint-Petersburg is often called a northern capital of Russia.  And it is recognized as a city of special importance by The Russian Constitution.  There are only two cities of special importance in Russia – Saint-Petersburg and of course Moscow.  No doubt Saint-Petersburg deserves such a status.\r\n\r\n The name of the city changed several times.  At first the city was called Saint-Petersburg but it was renamed to Petrograd in 1914.  Then in 1924 just after the death of Lenin the city was given the name Leningrad.  In 1991 the old name Saint-Petersburg was given back to the city.\r\n\r\n The city was founded by Peter I in 1703.  Its foundation started with building of The Fortress of Peter and Pavel which is now called Petropavlovskaya fortress.  But the fortress was never used in military aims.  It is more famous as the main prison of Peter’s times.  They guide some excursions inside the fortress now and you have an opportunity to see the prison cells of the eighteenth century.  The history of the city's foundation is connected with lots of victims.  Thousands of people gave their lives building Saint-Petersburg.  The city was built very quickly and the building was complicated with local area peculiarities.  In fact Petersburg is situated on water.  Some people even compare it with Venice but such a comparison is not very right.\r\n\r\n The city consists of forty four islands connected to each other with beautiful bridges.  Multiple channels give Saint-Petersburg its own charm.  If you are walking in Petersburg at night be accurate.  About two o’clock at night bridges start opening.  It’s necessary for big ships to have the opportunity to cross Saint-Petersburg.  So you’d better get some information about the regime of bridge opening in advance and look at this exciting show.\r\n\r\n In the cultural capital Saint-Petersburg you’ll find a lot of museums, monuments and cathedrals.  The most famous museum of world importance is of course the Hermitage.  The works of arts collection of the Hermitage was started with Ekaterina’s (Cathrine) purchase of 225 pictures made by masters from Western Europe.  Today the museum has about three million exhibits.  Just imagine!  You’ll need 15 years to see all the exhibits of the Hermitage having a minute looking at each of them and spending 8 hours a day on that.  Besides each hall itself is a work of art.  Malachite, George and Peter halls are very popular among tourists.\r\n\r\n In front of The Winter Palace – the Hermitage building there’s a Palace square.  You can have a nice walk on it.  But don’t stay here for long because there are lots of other places which are worth visiting in Saint-Petersburg.  But I think that each tourist must leave some time just for walking on the streets of the cultural capital, feeling the city atmosphere, diving to its rich history.  You can also walk in beautiful gardens and parks, for example to go to the quiet and mysterious Summer garden.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, pay attention to the churches and cathedrals which decorate Petersburg.  The Kazan cathedral, the Isaac cathedral, the Spas-na-krovi cathedral they are completely different.  You can relax on the benches or even on the grass if you want near The Kazan cathedral.  You have an opportunity to get to the top of the Isaac cathedral and to enjoy the view from the height of a bird’s flight.  By the way the Isaac cathedral is the biggest temple in Russia.  The Spas-na-krovi cathedral excites with the beauty of its domes.  And you must go inside to any of these cathedrals. "

        "text":"I ignored the feeling as best I could, knowing I could do nothing for myself with my hands shaking and no decent light to see by.  I’d have to wait for dawn to see how badly I was hurt.\r\n I tried not to dwell on what I knew from my work in the Medica.  Any deep wound to the gut promises a long, painful trip to the grave.  A skilled physicker with the right equipment could make a difference, but I couldn’t be farther from civilization.  I might as well wish for a piece of the moon.\r\n I wiped my sword, sat in the wet grass in front of the tent, and began to think.\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO The Broken Circle\r\n I had been busy for more than an hour when the sun finally peered over the tops of the trees and began to burn the dew from the grass.  I had found a flat rock and was using it as a makeshift anvil to hammer a spare horseshoe into a different shape.  Above the fire a pot of oats was boiling.\r\n I was just putting the finishing touches on the horseshoe when I saw a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye.  It was Krin peeking around the corner of the wagon.  I guessed I’d woken her with the sound of hammering iron.\r\n “Oh my God.”  Her hand went to her mouth and she took a couple stunned steps out from behind the wagon.  “You killed them.”\r\n “Yes,” I said simply, my voice sounding dead in my ears.\r\n Krin’s eyes ran up and down my body, staring at my torn and bloody shirt.  “Are . .  .”  Her voice caught in her throat, and she swallowed.  “Are you alright?”\r\n I nodded silently.  When I’d finally worked up the courage to examine my wound, I’d discovered that Felurian’s cloak had saved my life.  Instead of spilling open my guts, Alleg’s knife had merely given me a long, shallow cut across my belly.  He had also ruined a perfectly good shirt, but I had a hard time feeling bad about that, all things considered.\r\n I examined the horseshoe, then used a damp leather strap to tie it firmly to one end of a long, straight branch.  I pulled the kettle of oats off the fire and thrust the horseshoe into the coals.\r\n Seeming to recover from some of her shock, Krin slowly approached, eyeing the row of bodies on the other side of the fire.  I had done nothing other than lay them out in a rough line.  It wasn’t tidy.  Blood stained the bodies, and their wounds gaped openly.  Krin stared as if she were afraid they might start to move again.\r\n “What are you doing?”  she asked finally.\r\n In answer, I pulled the now-hot horseshoe from the coals of the fire and approached the nearest body.  It was Tim.  I pressed the hot iron against the back of his remaining hand.  The skin smoked and hissed and stuck to the metal.  After a moment I pulled it away, leaving a black burn against his white skin.  A broken circle.  I moved back to the fire and began to heat the iron again.\r\n Krin stood mutely, too stunned to react normally.  Not that there could be a normal way to react in a situation like this, I suppose.  But she didn’t scream or run off as I thought she might.  She simply looked at the broken circle and repeated, “What are you doing?”\r\n When I finally spoke, my voice sounded strange to my own ears.  “All of the Edema Ruh are one family,” I explained.  “Like a closed circle.  It doesn’t matter if some of us are strangers to others, we are still family, still close.  We have to be this way, because we are always strangers wherever we go.  We are scattered, and people hate us.\r\n “We have laws.  Rules we follow. "

        "text":"\"Well, I saw Tim Marcia this morning when I was getting my coffee.  He told me you two had talked recently.\"\r\n \"Yeah, yesterday.  Is this about that three-year deal he told me about?\"\r\n \"It certainly is, Harry.  Have you thought about it?\"\r\n \"I just heard about it yesterday.  I haven't had time to think about it.\"\r\n \"I think you should, Harry.  We need you back here.\"\r\n \"That's nice to hear, especially from you, Kiz.  I thought I was PNG with you.\"\r\n \"What does that mean?\"\r\n \"Persona non grata.\"\r\n \"Come on now.  It was nothing a cooling-off period couldn't cure.  Seriously, though, we could use you back here.  You could probably work with Tim's unit if you wanted.\"\r\n \"If I wanted?  Kiz, you make it sound like all I have to do is waltz in there and sign on the dotted line.  What do you think, everybody in that building is going to be there to welcome me back?  Are they going to be lined up in the hallway on the sixth floor, throwing rice or something while I walk to the chief's office?\"\r\n \"You talking about Irving?  Irving got downsized.  He's running the department of future planning.  I'm calling to tell you, Harry, that if you want to come back, then you are back.  It's that simple.  After I talked to Tim I went up to six and had my usual nine a.m. with the chief.  He knows of you.  He knows your work.\"\r\n \"I wonder how that could be, since I was gone before he was brought over from New York or Boston or wherever it was they got him from.\"\r\n \"He knows because I told him, Harry.  Look, let's not get into an argument over this.  Okay?  Everything is cool.  All I'm saying is that you should think about it.  The clock is ticking on it and you ought to think about it.  You could help us and the city and maybe even help yourself, depending on where you're at in the world.\"\r\n That last part raised a good question.  Where was I in the world?  I thought about it for a long moment before speaking.\r\n \"Yeah, okay.  Kiz, I appreciate it.  And thanks for putting in the word with the man.  Tell me something, when did Irving get dumped?  I hadn't heard about that.\"\r\n \"That happened a few months ago.  I think the chief thought he had his finger in too many pies.  He put him to the side.\"  I couldn't help but smile.  Not because Deputy Chief Irvin Irving had always had me under his heel, but because I knew a man like Irving wouldn't let anyone put him to the side, as Kiz had said.\r\n \"The man carries all the secrets,\" I said.\r\n \"I know.  We're waiting for his move.  We'll be ready.\"\r\n \"Then good luck to you.\"\r\n \"Thanks.  So what's it going to be, Harry?\"\r\n \"What, you want my answer now?  I thought you just told me to think about it.\"\r\n \"A guy like you, I already think you know the answer.\"\r\n I smiled again but didn't answer.  She was wasting her time in administration.  She should be back in homicide.  She knew how to read people better than anyone I had ever worked with.\r\n \"Harry, you remember the thing you told me when I first got assigned as your partner?\"\r\n \"Urn, chew your food, brush after every meal?\"\r\n \"I'm serious.\"\r\n \"I don't know, what?\"\r\n \"Everybody counts or nobody counts.\"\r\n I nodded and was quiet for a moment.\r\n \"Do you remember?\"\r\n \"Yeah.  I remember.\"\r\n \"Words to live by.\"\r\n \"I guess so.\"\r\n \"Well, think about that while you're thinking about coming back.\"\r\n \"If I come back, I'm going to need a partner.\"\r\n \"What, Harry?  You're breaking up.\"\r\n \"I'm going to need a partner.\"  There was a pause and I think now she was smiling, too.\r\n \"That's a possibility.  You-\"\r\n She cut out on me.  I think I knew what she was going to say.\r\n"

And magnificent furniture will take you back to the times of Peter I and Ekaterina II.\r\n\r\n The interesting sightseeing to visit are cruiser Aurora and the monument Cooper horseman.  Cruiser Aurora is situated near the building of Nahimov naval school.  The volley signing the start of Bolshevist’s Revolution was given here.  Cooper horseman is a monument erected by the order of Ekaterina II in glory of Peter I.Now you can read on the monument “To Peter I. Ekaterina II” in Russian from one side of it and in Latin from the other.  Its uniqueness is caused by the fact that the monument has only two points of support.\r\n\r\n Of course it’s not all you can see in Saint-Petersburg.  You can visit Kunstkamera, Russian Museum, monuments of Peter the Great, Ekaterina II, Nikolai I,The Smolny cathedral, numerous palaces etc.  It’s worth visiting the neighbourhood of Saint-Petersburg.  These are Petergof, Tzarskoye Selo, Pavlovsk, Oranienbaum.  The history of these towns plays a very important role for all the country.  For example, the family of Nikolay II had been kept locked up in Tzarskoye Selo before the start of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n You can fall in love with Saint-Petersburg.  Having come to this city once you want to come back here again and again.  You'll especially like it if you visit Saint-Petersburg at the end of May or at the start of June.  It’s right the time of white night here.  That means it’s not dark at night.  Such a geographical singularity.  And besides the weather here is very warm and sunny in this period of time."
