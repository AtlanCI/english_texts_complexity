        "text":" they’ll be fine, whereas smokers won’t.  They’ll start eating your\r\n tablecloths, and if you object, you’ll be on the receiving end of what\r\n I now believe is known as ‘a Prescott’.\r\n\r\n After an hour on the phone it looked like we’d have to give up and\r\n eat in a pub which, as I’m sure you know, is slightly less appealing\r\n than eating the pub itself.  The only thing I can say about ‘pub grub’\r\n is that it tastes like I cooked it.  And I am the only person in the world\r\n who can make cauliflower taste like the back of a fridge freezer.\r\n Eventually, we found a rather nice smoker-friendly fish restaurant\r\n called Dexters in Deddington, which is a local place for local people,\r\nall of whom were not celebrating their wedding anniversaries, or\r\n indeed anything.  That’s why they were at home and we were the\r\n only people in there.\r\n\r\n So, one has to presume, it will eventually close or ban smoking and\r\n then that’ll be it.  We’ll have to start eating the millstone grit\r\n outcrops.\r\n\r\n I’m not kidding.  I live in the Cotswolds, one of the most affluent,\r\nsought-after areas in the whole country – a six-bedroom manor\r\n house round here costs more than a whole book of stamps – and\r\n yet there is only one worthwhile restaurant within a half-hour’s drive.\r\n One.  And it’s empty.\r\n\r\n However, before everyone in London splits in half with mirth I should\r\n point out that the three worst meals I’ve ever eaten were all at well-\r\n known restaurants in Notting Hill.  Last week.\r\n In one we were told by a waiter, who looked like his house had just\r\n burnt down, that the chef had messed up the food and that most of\r\n it was off.  We never saw the wine we ordered, my crab starter was\r\n covered in wallpaper paste and after two hours the main course still\r\n hadn’t turned up at all.\r\n\r\n And I’m not alone.  Everyone I’ve talked to recently is saying that\r\n their favourite restaurant is starting to deliver what tastes like\r\n hamster droppings to table 9 at 10 p.m., when it should have gone\r\n to table 14 at 7 p.m.\r\n\r\n But this was inevitable because while the countryside has no\r\n restaurants at all, London has far too many.  Take West End Lane in\r\n Hampstead.  It used to be a shopping street but all they can offer\r\n now, apart from a haircut and a bijou flat for the price of\r\n Gloucestershire, is a plate of spaghetti that should have gone to\r\n table 8 last week.\r\n\r\n A year ago the situation was so bad that restaurateurs were\r\n reduced to trawling Paris for waiting staff.  Some reports suggested\r\n that as many as 10,000 surly, off-hand Pierres had migrated to\r\n London.  And that was then.\r\n\r\n Now, with more and more new restaurants opening every day, I’m\r\n surprised Marco Pierre White isn’t to be found at the traffic lights\r\n offering jobs to passing motorists.  Hell, I’m surprised he isn’t offering\r\n them to the Albanian window washers.\r\n\r\n You see, it’s all very well employing the best chef in the world, but\r\n what’s the point if you can’t find someone to take it from the kitchen\r\n to the dining room?  Well, someone with a sense of direction and a\r\n basic grasp of English anyway.\r\n\r\n I was disappointed the other day when my six-yearold daughter said\r\n she wanted to be a waitress when she grew up.  The way things are\r\n she wanted to be a waitress when she grew up.  The way things are\r\n going she could get a job now.  Unfortunately though, there aren’t\r\n any openings round here.  Indeed, the only place where you can get\r\n a decent steak is called a pyre.\r\n\r\n Sunday 20 May 2001"

        "text":"Cutting Lawns is the Last Word in Civilisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Having seen Emmanuelle in Bangkok, I thought I knew what a\r\n massage would be like.  Well it isn’t.\r\n\r\n The first disappointment comes when you find that there will only be\r\n one masseuse, and the second when you discover that his name is\r\n Bill.\r\n\r\n Then things really start to go pear-shaped.  After asking you to\r\n undress and lie face-down on the bed, he’ll tell you that you’re\r\n tense.  And you’ll want to reply that this is not surprising because\r\n you were not expecting someone who learnt all about body\r\n pressure points while serving as a Spetsnaz assassin.  But all you’ll\r\n manage is a muffled ‘Aaaaaaaargh’.\r\n\r\n Be assured, a proper massage gives you some idea of what it would\r\n be like to fall down a mountain while locked in a fridge freezer.  It\r\n would be more relaxing to have your fingernails torn out while being\r\n force-fed with used engine oil.\r\n\r\n I have discovered that the best way of soothing away the stresses\r\n and strains of the working week is to mow the lawn.  Sitting there,\r\nwith the sun on your back, concentrating on nothing but going in a\r\n straight line and not running over the flowers, you can actually feel\r\n your muscles turning to jelly and your teeth unclenching.\r\n\r\n And then, when you’ve finished, you can stand back with your\r\n hands on your hips and admire the sheer geometric perfection of\r\n that verdant test card, that subtle blend of absolute straightness in\r\n a curved and wild world.  You have taken on nature and, with\r\n nothing more than a Honda Lawnmaster, brought civilisation and\r\n order to the unruly forces of nature.  Well done.  You are now a lawn\r\n bore.\r\n\r\n You will start shouting at your children if they ride their bicycles on\r\n your immaculate conception.  You will tut when you find discarded\r\n cigarette butts.  You will stand for hours in the garden centre eying\r\n up trowels, and you will talk about Roundup with your friends in the\r\n pub.\r\n\r\n I am now such a lawn bore that when I discovered a thistle that had\r\n dared to show its hideous, ugly face in my perfect turf I shot it.\r\n And while I like having a fighter plane in the garden – it’s better than\r\n a water feature because the children can’t drown in it – I was\r\n inconsolable when I saw the damage that had been done while it\r\n was being towed into position.  There were three grooves, each a\r\n foot deep, stretching all the way from the broken electric gates to\r\n my dead yew hedge.\r\n\r\n This, you see, is my problem.  I want to be a gardener.  I want a\r\n potting shed and some secateurs.  I want Homes & Gardens\r\n magazine to profile my work, but all I can do is cut grass.  Everything\r\n else turns to disaster.\r\n\r\n Two years ago the field across the road was planted with saplings\r\n and I bought precisely the same stuff for a patch of land next to my\r\n paddock.  Today, his trees are 12–14 feet tall.  Mine have been\r\n eaten by hares.\r\n\r\n I filled the grooves in the lawn with ten tons of the finest topsoil\r\n money can buy and then, to speed the repair along, mixed some\r\n grass seed with the most expensive organic compost in the world\r\n and sprinkled it all on top.  And the result?  Three long and unsightly\r\n strips of mushrooms.\r\n I was assured that my yew trees would grow at the rate of a foot\r\n every twelve months but they did nothing of the sort.  For the first\r\n two years they just sat there and then they decided to die.  So they\r\n did.\r\n\r\n So I was intrigued last week by the fierce debate that appeared to\r\n have been raging at the Chelsea Flower Show.\r\n\r\n There are those who like gardens to be traditional, a Technicolor\r\n riot of flora and fauna harmonised to create a little piece of\r\n harmonised chaos.  These people are called gardeners.\r\n Then you have the modernists who think it is much better to throw\r\n away the plants and replace them with stark concrete walls and\r\n gravel.  These people are called Darren and you see them every\r\n week on Ground Force.\r\n\r\n The Darren philosophy is tempting.  First of all, you get a quick fix, a\r\n well-planned and attractive garden in a couple of hours.  And\r\n second, the whole thing can be maintained by taking the Hoover to\r\n it once a year.\r\n\r\n But these modern gardens do feel a bit like rooms without roofs,\r\nand you will lose things in the gaps of your decking.  I know one man\r\n who lost his wife down there.\r\n\r\n So what about the gardening option?  Well, all things considered, it\r\n doesn’t sound quite so good.  I mean, what’s the point of planting an\r\n oak tree when the best that can happen is that it stops being a twig\r\n just in time for the birth of your great-great-great-grandson.  And the\r\n worst is that it commits suicide.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, if you go down the gardening route, you will have to\r\n spend your entire retirement in crap clothes with your head between\r\n your ankles.  You will then get a bad back and that will require\r\n terrifying and undignified weekly appointments with Bill at the\r\n massage parlour.\r\n\r\n So what’s the answer then?  Well, I’ve just bought an acre or so and\r\n I’m going to employ the third way.  I’m going to do absolutely nothing,\r\nand next year I shall call it ‘the New Labour wilderness’, and\r\n transport it to Chelsea where it will win a gold medal.\r\n\r\n Sunday 27 May 2001\r\n\r\n\r\n An Invitation from My Wife I Wish I Could Refuse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n What would life be like if parties had never been invented?  Tents\r\n would still be used solely as places for Boy Scouts to sleep, there\r\n would be no such thing as a plate clip and you would never have\r\n heard an amateur speech.\r\n\r\n There would be no black tie, no parking in paddocks, no chance of\r\n running into former spouses and you would never have drunk a\r\n warm Martini, garnished with ash, at four in the morning because\r\n the rest of the booze had run out.\r\n\r\n We’re not even programmed to enjoy parties that much.  Think.\r\n When you were little you liked your teddy and you liked your mum,\r\nbut other children were the enemy.  You were forced to go, and sat\r\n on your bottom waiting to be humiliated by someone saying: ‘Oh\r\n dear.  Who’s had a little accident then?’\r\n\r\n You always have little accidents at parties.  No sooner are you out of\r\n nappies than you’re straight into the flowerbed where the hostess’s\r\n mother finds you face down at dawn.  And then when you’re married,\r\nyou get in huge trouble for dancing with the wrong girl in the wrong\r\n way for too long.\r\n\r\n I mention all this because three weeks ago I caught the perfect\r\n illness.  There was no pain, just an overwhelming need to lie in bed\r\n all day eating comfort food and watching Battle of the Bulge.\r\n I was enjoying myself very much, but halfway through the afternoon\r\n my wife tired of popping upstairs with trays of quails’ eggs and\r\n mushroom soup and, with that hands-on-hips way that wives have\r\n when their husbands are not very ill, announced that I should get up\r\n and organise a party for her fortieth birthday.  ‘You have 21 days.’\r\n My first chance to have a little accident came with the invitations.\r\n Every morning we get invites but we have no idea who they are from\r\n or where the party is being held because the typeface is a\r\n meaningless collection of squirls, and all the instructions at the\r\n bottom are in French.  RSVP.\r\n\r\n I thought the solution would be simple.  Write in block capitals and\r\n use English.  But oh no.  Nowadays, it’s important to make your\r\n invitation stand out on the mantelpiece, so it must be written on an\r\n ingot or a CD-Rom or on a man’s naked bottom.\r\n\r\n The printer was quite taken aback when I asked for card.  ‘Card?’  he\r\n said.  ‘Gosh, that really is unusual.’  And then he gave me an\r\n estimate: ‘For 150 invites, sir, that will be £6.2 million.  Or you could\r\n go down to Prontaprint and have exactly the same thing for 12p.’\r\n Right.\r\n\r\n The next problem is deciding on a dress code.  What you’re\r\n supposed to do these days is dream up a snappy phrase such as\r\n ‘Dress to thrill’ or ‘Urban gothic’, but since none of our friends would\r\n have the first clue what any of this meant, I put ‘No corduroy’.\r\n With just two weeks to go I called a party organiser to help out with\r\n the event itself.  ‘All we want,’ I explained, ‘is a bit of canvas to keep\r\n the wind off everyone’s vol-au-vents.’\r\n\r\n Well, it doesn’t work out like that because he sits you down and\r\n says that you really ought to have some kind of flooring.  It’s only\r\n £170.  So you say fine.  And then he says that electricity might be a\r\n good idea, too.  It’s only £170.  Everything is only £170, so you end\r\n up ordering the lot.\r\n\r\n When the estimate came, I really was ill.  ‘What would you like?’\r\n asked my wife, seeing that this time I wasn’t faking.  ‘Some fish\r\n fingers?  A nourishing bowl of chicken soup?  Where Eagles Dare?’\r\n No.  What I want is for everyone we’ve invited to come over all dead.\r\n It was not to be.  With a week to go, only six had had the decency to\r\n say no and the next day, two changed their minds.\r\n\r\n Except, of course, we hadn’t heard a whisper from anyone who has\r\n ever appeared on television.  It is a known fact that once you’ve\r\n been on the electric fish-tank, even if it’s just for a moment in a\r\n Dixons shop window, you lose the ability to reply to party invitations.\r\n So you’ve got the caterers asking how many they should cook for\r\n and you’re having to say they’d better get Jesus in the kitchen\r\n because it could be five or it could be five thousand.\r\n\r\n Then the guests start telephoning asking what they should wear\r\n instead of corduroy and where they can stay.  Here’s a tip.  When\r\n you’re looking for a hotel in Chipping Norton, you’re more likely to\r\n find out what’s good and what’s not by calling someone in Glasgow.\r\n People who live in Chipping Norton usually have no need of local\r\n hotels.  And I don’t care what you wear.  And yes, your ex-husband\r\n will be here.  And no, I’m not going to tow you out of the paddock if it\r\n turns into a quagmire.\r\n\r\n You’ll probably have a miserable time but look at it this way.  It’ll be\r\n much more miserable for me, and even more miserable for the poor\r\n old dear who lives next door.  As the band wheeled in their speaker\r\n stacks, I called her to explain that there might be a bit of noise on\r\n Saturday night.  ‘Oh I don’t mind,’ she said.  ‘What is it?  A dinner\r\n dance?’\r\n\r\n No, not really, it’s more a chance for all my wife’s wildly disparate\r\n groups of friends to come and not get on with each other.\r\n Sunday 10 June 2001\r\n\r\n\r\n How Big a Mistake are You Going to\r\n Make?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text":" For a moment there” — a little fire rose and died in his eyes — “I thought we were getting our true reception.  All the yelling and singing and speeches.  Pretty nice, wasn’t it — while it lasted?”\r\n “How long will they keep us here, sir?”\r\n “Until we prove we’re not psychotics.”\r\n “That should be easy.”\r\n “I hope so.”\r\n “You don’t sound very certain, sir.”\r\n “I’m not.  Look in that corner.”\r\n A man squatted alone in darkness.  Out of his mouth issued a blue flame which turned into the round shape of a small naked woman.  It flourished on the air softly in vapors of cobalt light, whispering and sighing.\r\n The captain nodded at another corner.  A woman stood there, changing.  First she was embedded in a crystal pillar, then she melted into a golden statue, finally a staff of polished cedar, and back to a woman.\r\n All through the midnight hall people were juggling thin violet flames, shifting, changing, for nighttime was the time of change and affliction.\r\n “Magicians, sorcerers,” whispered one of the Earth Men.\r\n “No, hallucination.  They pass their insanity over into us so that we see their hallucinations too.  Telepathy.  Autosuggestion and telepathy.”\r\n “Is that what worries you, sir?”\r\n “Yes.  If hallucinations can appear this ’real’ to us, to anyone, if hallucinations are catching and almost believable, it’s no wonder they mistook us for psychotics.  If that man can produce little blue fire women and that woman there melt into a pillar, how natural if normal Martians think we produce our rocket ship with our minds.”\r\n “Oh,” said his men in the shadows.\r\n Around them, in the vast hall, flames leaped blue, flared, evaporated.  Little demons of red sand ran between the teeth of sleeping men.  Women became oily snakes.  There was a smell of reptiles and animals.\r\n In the morning everyone stood around looking fresh, happy, and normal.  There were no flames or demons in the room.  The captain and his men waited by the silver door, hoping it would open.\r\n Mr. Xxx arrived after about four hours.  They had a suspicion that he had waited outside the door, peering in at them for at least three hours before he stepped in, beckoned, and led them to his small office.\r\n He was a jovial, smiling man, if one could believe the mask he wore, for upon it was painted not one smile, but three.  Behind it, his voice was the voice of a not so smiling psychologist.  “What seems to be the trouble?”\r\n “You think we’re insane, and we’re not,” said the captain.\r\n “Contrarily, I do not think all of you are insane.”  The psychologist pointed a little wand at the captain.  “No.  Just you, sir.  The others are secondary hallucinations.”\r\n The captain slapped his knee, “So that’s it!  That’s why Mr. Iii laughed when I suggested my men sign the papers too!”\r\n “Yes, Mr. Iii told me.”  The psychologist laughed out of the carved, smiling mouth.  “A good joke.  Where was I?  Secondary hallucinations, yes.  Women come to me with snakes crawling from their ears.  When I cure them, the snakes vanish.”\r\n “We’ll be glad to be cured.  Go right ahead.”\r\n Mr. Xxx seemed surprised.  “Unusual.  Not many people want to be cured.  The cure is drastic, you know.”\r\n “Cure ahead!  I’m confident you’ll find we’re all sane.”\r\n “Let me check your papers to be sure they’re in order for a ‘cure.”  He checked a file.  “Yes.  You know, such cases as yours need special ‘curing.’  The people in that hall are simpler forms.  But once you’ve gone this far, I must point out, with primary, secondary, auditory, olfactory, and labial hallucinations, as well as tactile and optical fantasies, it is pretty bad business.  We have to resort to euthanasia.”\r\n The captain leaped up with a roar.  “Look here, we’ve stood quite enough!  Test us, tap our knees, check our hearts, exercise us, ask questions!”\r\n “You are free to speak.”\r\n The captain raved for an hour.  The psychologist listened.\r\n “Incredible,” he mused.  “Most detailed dream fantasy I’ve ever heard.”\r\n “God damn it, we’ll show you the rocket ship!”  screamed the captain.\r\n “I’d like to see it.  Can you manifest it in this room?”\r\n “Oh, certainly.  It’s in that file of yours, under R.”\r\n Mr. Xxx peered seriously into his file.  He went “Tsk” and shut the file solemnly.  “Why did you tell me to look?  The rocket isn’t there.”\r\n “Of course not, you idiot!  I was joking.  Does an insane man joke?”\r\n “You find some odd senses of humor.  Now, take me out to your rocket.  I wish to see it.”\r\n\r\n It was noon.  The day was very hot when they reached the rocket.\r\n “So.”  The psychologist walked up to the ship and tapped it.  It gonged softly.  “May I go inside?”  he asked slyly.\r\n “You may.”\r\n Mr. Xxx stepped in and was gone for a long time.\r\n “Of all the silly, exasperating things.”  The captain chewed a cigar as he waited.  “For two cents I’d go back home and tell people not to bother with Mars.  What a suspicious bunch of louts.”\r\n “I gather that a good number of their population are insane, sir.  That seems to be their main reason for doubting.”\r\n “Nevertheless, this is all so damned irritating.”\r\n The psychologist emerged from the ship after half an hour of prowling, tapping, listening, smelling, tasting.\r\n “Now do you believe!”  shouted the captain, as if he were deaf.\r\n The psychologist shut his eyes and scratched his nose.  “This is the most incredible example of sensual hallucination and hypnotic suggestion I’ve ever encountered.  I went through your ‘rocket,’ as you call it.”  He tapped the hull.  “I hear it.  Auditory fantasy.”  He drew a breath.  “I smell it.  Olfactory hallucination, induced by sensual telepathy.”  He kissed the ship.  “I taste it.  Labial fantasy!”\r\n He shook the captain’s hand.  “May I congratulate you?  You are a psychotic genius!  You have done a most complete job!  The task of projecting your psychotic image life into the mind of another via telepathy and keeping the hallucinations from becoming sensually weaker is almost impossible.  Those people in the House usually concentrate on visuals or, at the most, visuals and auditory fantasies combined.  You have balanced the whole conglomeration!  Your insanity is beautifully complete!”\r\n “My insanity.”  The captain was pale.\r\n “Yes, yes, what a lovely insanity.  Metal, rubber, gravitizers, foods, clothing, fuel, weapons, ladders, nuts, bolts, spoons.  Ten thousand separate items I checked on your vessel.  Never have I seen such a complexity.  There were even shadows under the bunks and under everything!  Such concentration of will!  And everything, no matter how or when tested, had a smell, a solidity, a taste, a sound!  Let me embrace you!”\r\n He stood back at last.  “I’ll write this into my greatest monograph!  I’ll speak of it at the Martian Academy next month!  Look at you!  Why, you’ve even changed your eye color from yellow to blue, your skin to pink from brown. "

Don’t shoot!”\r\n “You sad creature.  I shall put you out of this misery which has driven you to imagine this rocket and these three men.  It will be most engrossing to watch your friends and your rocket vanish once I have killed you.  I will write a neat paper on the dissolvement of neurotic images from what I perceive here today.”\r\n “I’m from Earth!  My name is Jonathan Williams, and these — ”\r\n “Yes, I know,” soothed Mr. Xxx, and fired his gun.\r\n The captain fell with a bullet in his heart.  The other three men screamed.\r\n Mr. Xxx stared at them.  “You continue to exist?  This is superb!  Hallucinations with time and spatial persistence!”  He pointed the gun at them.  “Well, I’ll scare you into dissolving.”\r\n “No!”  cried the three men,\r\n“An auditory appeal, even with the patient dead,” observed Mr. Xxx as he shot the three men down.\r\n They lay on the sand, intact, not moving.\r\n He kicked them.  Then he rapped on the ship.\r\n “It persists!  They persist!”  He fired his gun again and again at the bodies.  Then he stood back.  The smiling mask dropped from his face.\r\n Slowly the little psychologist’s face changed.  His jaw sagged.  The gun dropped from his fingers.  His eyes were dull and vacant He put his hands up and turned in a blind cirde.  He fumbled at the bodies, saliva filling his mouth.\r\n “Hallucinations,” he mumbled frantically.  “Taste.  Sight.  Smell.  Sound.  Feeling.”  He waved his hands.  His eyes bulged.  His mouth began to give off a faint froth.\r\n “Go away!”  he shouted at the bodies.  “Go away!”  he screamed at the ship.  He examined his trembling hands.  “Contaminated,” he whispered wildly.  “Carried over into me.  Telepathy.  Hypnosis.  Now I’m insane, Now I’m contaminated.  Hallucinations in all their sensual forms.”  He stopped and searched around with his numb hands for the gun.  “Only one cure.  Only one way to make them go away, vanish.”\r\n A shot rang out, Mr. Xxx fell.\r\n The four bodies lay in the sun.  Mr. Xxx lay where he fell.\r\n The rocket reclined on the little sunny hill and didn’t vanish.\r\n When the town people found the rocket at sunset they wondered what it was.  Nobody knew, so it was sold to a junkman and hauled off to be broken up for scrap metal.\r\n That night it rained all night.  The next day was fair and warm."

        "text":"Tea... the healthiest beverage on earth\r\n\r\nPeople have been exploring tea's health benefits for 5,000 years. Whether we are seeking mental alertness, protection against disease, or renewal of the spirit, we enjoy tea for many reasons.\r\n\r\nResearch on tea and its health effects is underway in academic institutions and medical settings all over the world and many exciting leads have been uncovered. As more studies begin to test findings on human subjects we gain valuable information about how tea can help us in our own lives.\r\n \r\nNone of the following information should be interpreted as or substituted for medical advice. It is simply a presentation of some of the promising findings presented in recent years.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Antioxidant Story.\r\n\r\nEach day, we may be exposed to harmful influences — foods high in fat and sugar, chemicals in the environment, cigarette smoke, and more. In response, our bodies produce unstable molecules called oxidants or \"free radicals\" that can damage healthy cells. The result can be chronic illnesses, immune system damage, organ disease, and other health problems. \r\nAntioxidants found in foods like fruits, vegetables, and tea, can help to limit the effects of free radicals. The antioxidants combine with free radicals so they can no longer harm other cells. In this way, it is believed that antioxidants may reduce the occurrence and size of some kinds of tumors and inhibit their growth.\r\n \r\nYou will see many terms associated with antioxidants and tea that might seem confusing at first. They are all closely linked.\r\n\r\n• Antioxidants are molecules that slow or stop oxidants.\r\n• Polyphenols found in tea have strong antioxidant qualities.\r\n• Flavonoids are a type of polyphenol found in tea.\r\n• Catechins are a component of flavonoids. There are four types of catechins in tea. EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate) is the one discussed most frequently with regards to tea's health benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow tea helps our bodies\r\n\r\nCardiovascular Health\r\nSome of the benefits to heart health that have been suggested by early studies include lowering LDL cholesterol (1) and improving the ability of blood vessel lining to expand when blood flow increases (2). Some believe that tea might also help lower blood pressure.\r\n\r\nImmune system\r\nAntioxidants may help to protect Immune System (3) the L-theanine, an amino acid present in tea, may \"prime\" the immune system to help it fight infection, bacteria, viruses, and fungi (4). In addition, tea is rich in vitamins and minerals including B1, B2, B6, C, folic acid, magnesium, potassium, and zinc.\r\n\r\nCognition\r\nTea's amino acids may also help you gain a calmer, but more alert, mental state. The effect can last for 3 - 4 hours (5).\r\n\r\nCancer\r\nEarly research suggests that some components of tea might help to reduce cancer risk. This is one of the most active areas of research currently.\r\n\r\nOral Health\r\nTea contains a natural fluoride, encouraging healthy tooth enamel (6), and the flavonoids in tea may slow the formation of plaque by bacteria in the mouth (7).\r\n\r\nWeight Loss\r\nTea has no calories and helps to hydrate the body. Substituting unsweetened tea for sugary drinks like soda can be a useful tool in maintaining a healthy weight. It is also thought that tea can help to boost metabolism (4). One should not, however, believe claims that \"Wulong\" tea is \"weight-loss tea.\" \"Wulong\" is simply another word for \"oolong\" and it has not shown any more, or less, impact on weight loss.\r\n\r\nBone Health\r\nA study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that older women who were tea drinkers had higher bone mineral density (BMD) than non-tea drinker (8). —  —  — \r\n\r\n1 Davies MJ, Judd JT, Baer DJ, Clevidence BA, Paul DR, Edwards AJ, Wiseman SA, Muesing RA, Chen SC.

        "text":"You've probably experienced the sensation of déjà vu   —   that eerie sense that you get when you know you have seen or done something before, even if you couldn't have.  It's the closest we can come to experiencing a real-life time loop.\r\n\r\n How does your brain make things seem familiar when they aren't?  Let's take a look!  Again!  Possibly! \r\n\r\n In fantasy series, if a hero suddenly is overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity at a certain place or event, it's usually because they've had a prophetic dream or vision.  They were meant to see exactly this, so they could be prepared to fight the monster that's about to jump out at them . . .  now!  Outside of film and television, déjà vu generally gets us in more prosaic ways.  We come to a place that's new, but are sure we've seen it before.  We feel a striking sense of, say, telling a stranger that they've dropped their keys before.  It may just come to us as a weird sense of over-familiarity in an already familiar setting.  Why do we feel this way?\r\n\r\n And how could you go about creating this sensation on purpose?\r\n\r\n One way to create the sensation is simply to implant false memories in someone   —   a task that is surprisingly easy.  There have been multiple experiments where, with just a little coaching, people will remember a specific memory of being lost in a mall as a child and found by a kindly old lady, despite their relatives confirming that that never happened.  Other times, people have been convinced that they saw a person in a Bugs Bunny costume entertaining them during a childhood trip to Disneyland, despite Bugs not being a Disney character.  People will remember all kinds of things, with a little prompting.\r\n\r\n You could also actually briefly expose someone to an object   —   a section of town, a painting, a snatch of a filmstrip   —   and then allow them to wander back and take it in slowly, creating an actual memory that they may not be able to pin down.  Researchers have had great success with showing subjects words, names, or faces for a fraction of a second on a computer screen, and inducing a feeling of déjà vu by showing people the same thing for a longer amount of time, just moments later.\r\n\r\n To induce a more general and spontaneous sensation of déjà vu, and one that pops up out of the blue, you just have to get the conditions right.  The sensation happens to young people more than old people, but mostly because younger people will have more erratic routines.  This feeling happens most often when people are tired and stressed, or have a lot of things on their minds.  It can happen when people are put under hypnosis to the point where they're out of it.  But déjà vu isn't a mental blip brought on by stress.  It's not a blip at all.  It's a lack.\r\n\r\n The feeling of familiarity isn't a by-product of seeing familiar objects.  It's a feeling all on its own.  Many experts believe it resides within the parahippocampal gyrus, which can spring into action when it's needed during normal activities.  We both recognize the object itself, and get the feeling that we've seen it somewhere before.  Sometimes that feeling, the recognition memory, leads straight and fast to an actual memory of when we've seen the thing before.  Sometimes it's dismissed, since it doesn't matter when we've seen something before.  (We can all recognize a Coke bottle but it doesn't matter to us when we last saw it, when we first saw one, or how it became familiar to us.)\r\n\r\n"

        "text":" But Marya respected Francesca profoundly, and loved her, like a daughter or a niece.  “Even if you got married ten times, you wouldn’t be anything like her.”\r\n “I’d rather not risk it.  I wonder if she’ll ever find another victim.  She’s been shopping for number six for years.  You’d think she’d get tired of it and forget it, but she never will.  She’ll want to get married again when she’s ninety.”  They both laughed and suspected it was true.\r\n She and Chris talked about their plans for the house that night.  She was wondering when they should tell Ian.\r\n “Do you think he’ll be upset if you move upstairs with me?”  She looked worried, and Chris kissed her.\r\n “Stop worrying.  He’ll be thrilled to have his own playroom.  I’m going to get him a big TV so he can watch movies.  And we’ll just be up one flight of stairs.”  They were both excited about finally sharing a bedroom.  It was becoming a real life, not just a romance.\r\n They had a lot to think about and to talk about, and Francesca reminded him that the following weekend they were going to Miami for Art Basel.  It was one of the finest art\r\n fairs in the world, second only to the one held in Basel, Switzerland, in June.  And there were a dozen other smaller art fairs being held in Miami that weekend too.  Francesca could hardly wait, and Chris was coming with her.  She was still shaken by Marya moving to Paris, and especially so soon, but they had a lot to look forward to, and their life together was just beginning.\r\n He wanted her to come to Boston to be with his family for Christmas.  Francesca had said she would, and Ian wanted her to, but the thought of it scared her to death.  What if they hated her or thought she wasn’t good enough for him?  She was just a little art dealer in the West Village, and the daughter of a famous artist.  His family was chock full of important people.\r\n “They’re going to love you.  I promise,” Chris reassured her.  She decided to postpone worrying about it till after Miami.  Between Marya leaving, switching the house around when she left, Christmas with his family, and the art fair in Miami in less than a week, December was going to be busy.\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 20\r\n\r\n MARYA AND CHARLES-Edouard had agreed to baby-sit for Ian, when Chris and Francesca left for Miami for the weekend.  She could hardly wait to see the different art fairs.  There was Scope and Red Dot, and fourteen others, along with Art Basel, which was the finest in the world.  The work that was exhibited there would sell for a fortune.  Her father’s dealer had a booth, her father and Avery went every year, and she had promised to call them.  Francesca and Chris were staying at the Delano, and when Chris saw it, he loved it.  Each of the elevators was lit up in a different color, and the rooms had been designed by Philippe Starck.  The weather was balmy and warm when they arrived, and Chris was dying to spend some time at the pool.  Francesca wanted to go straight to the fair and get started.  They’d be seeing more art in the next few days than most people saw in years.\r\n Art Basel was at the Convention Center in Miami Beach in an enormous hall, and the others were at the Ice Palace and scattered around the city in different locations.  Some of the smaller fairs had taken over hotels, and each room was rented by a different dealer.  And there were parties in a dozen locations, in discos and hotels and restaurants.  Francesca had received a stack of invitations.  It was Chris’s introduction into the serious art world, by total immersion.  He was excited about sharing it with her, and willingly put himself in her hands.  But he stopped her before they left the room, and they wound up in bed for half an hour.  It was a nice way to start the trip.  They showered, changed, and went out.\r\n They caught a cab at the hotel, and went to the Convention Center.  There was a separate building for younger artists and more avant-garde work.  Francesca’s dream was to show at one of the smaller fairs in Miami one day.  She was planning to apply to Red Dot the following year, but didn’t feel she was ready for it yet.  And she expected to spend several years on the waiting list.  Getting into art fairs was extremely political, and often depended on who you knew.  She had a great in through her father, but she hadn’t traded on it yet.  She would if she absolutely had to.\r\n “I’m never afraid to grovel for my artists,” she said to Chris, and he laughed as they got out of the cab at the huge hall.  She had a pass from her father’s dealer to get in, and a few minutes later they were walking down the aisles, stopping at each booth to check out the art.  Chris was amazed at what they saw.  There were an infinite number of traditional dealers, selling important paintings.  He saw three Picassos in less than five minutes, at astronomical prices.  He saw a Matisse, a Chagall, two de Koonings, a Pollock, and two of her father’s paintings were exhibited by his dealer.  One had a red dot next to it, which meant it was already sold.  The other had a white dot, which meant it was on hold for a\r\n client.  You had to have a big budget to buy there.  “Where does all this stuff come from?”  Chris said in amazement.  He had never seen\r\n so much art in his life, and the high caliber of the artists shown there was impressive.  “Europe, the States, Hong Kong.”  Dealers from all over the world were showing there, and had flown in from everywhere.  There were also a vast number of avant-garde galleries that were showing art that was intended to shock.  There were video installations, conceptual art, and in one booth a huge mound of sand on the floor.  It was selling for a\r\n hundred thousand dollars, and installed by the artist, who was well known.  Chris made comments as they walked along, and Francesca told him who some of the artists were.  She loved being there with him, and they stayed until nearly eight o’clock, and after that they took a cab to a party she’d been invited to at a restaurant called Bed, where people sat and lay on mattresses and ate dinner.  Every conversation they heard around them was about art and artists, the quality of the show, the expensive pieces that had already sold.  Francesca ran into a lot of people she knew and introduced them to Chris.  She was having a ball and loved every minute of it, and he was enjoying himself\r\n too.  This was her world, and it fascinated him.  Everyone seemed to know her.  They didn’t get back to the hotel until two A.M., after stopping at another party hosted by a dealer at a disco.  They danced for a little while and then went home, and fell into bed in their stark white room at the Delano.  They were dead to the world when Ian woke them up the next morning.  He had just bought a Christmas tree with Marya, and they were making decorations.  They were going to bake some of them to hang on the tree, and he sounded excited.  Chris smiled at Francesca proudly after they hung up.  Ian promised to\r\n call them back later.  “He’s such a great kid, isn’t he?”  Chris said, cuddling up to her in bed. "

        "text":"The police took Francesca to the Hotel Gansevoort.  She took a room, and sat there shaking.  She didn’t want to go back to the house.  And it seemed like hours later when Chris called her.  She had lost all track of time.  He was on his way in from the airport and wanted to know where she was.  She told him, and he was there a few minutes later.  She opened the door to him and nearly fell into his arms.  He stood there and held her, and then sat down on the bed with her as Francesca cried.\r\n “Stupid kid” was all he could bring himself to say.  He was angry and sad all at the same time.  And if it hadn’t been Eileen, it could have been his wife a dozen times.  She had just been lucky so far, but one day she wouldn’t be.  One day she would wind up like Eileen, only with a needle in her arm, and Ian would be heart broken.  He hated them for the risks they took, the people they hurt, the hearts they broke, all the tears that were shed for them.  Francesca cried herself to sleep in his arms that night.  He lay on the bed next to her, and held her as he had Ian so many times.  And in the morning, Francesca got a call from the police.  They had Brad.  They had run fingerprints on him and from the scene.  The prints matched.  It was him.  They would do DNA tests, but all the puzzle pieces fit.  The evidence was conclusive so far.  Brad had killed Eileen.\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 14\r\n\r\n FRANCESCA WOKE UP feeling groggy and confused, unsure if what she thought had happened had been a dream.  She had fallen asleep in her clothes on the bed next to Chris in the room she had taken at the Hotel Gansevoort.  As she opened her eyes, she turned to look at him.  He was still lying next to her, and he was awake.\r\n “Did I dream it?”  He shook his head.  It wasn’t possible.  That couldn’t happen.  It wasn’t fair.  Eileen was dead.  Her Internet insanity had killed her.  But it was more than just that, it was Eileen’s appalling judgment, her addiction to bad men, and her lifetime familiarity with abuse.  All of that had contributed to her sad end.  They all knew lots of nice people who had met each other online, fallen in love, and gotten married.  But mixed in with the good ones were terrifyingly bad ones, and Brad had been one of those.  And Eileen had become too addicted to him and the abuse to save herself.  She had gone back for more one last time.  One time too many.\r\n Chris had checked, and Brad was still being held on suspicion of her murder.  They wanted Francesca and Chris to identify him in a lineup, and then they would arraign him the next day.  They had already started the DNA tests from his skin, to match traces found under Eileen’s nails.  They would have partial results in three days.  Her body was at the morgue, and after the autopsy she was going to be cremated, but not for several days.  With her heart in her shoes, Francesca couldn’t help asking herself now what did any of it matter.  Whatever they did, she’d still be dead.  She was such a lost girl.  She kept thinking of her making papier-mâché puppets with Ian, and as Francesca thought of the scene the day before, and identifying her, she got up and went to the bathroom and vomited again.  She was kneeling on the bathroom floor, as Chris rubbed her back, and held her hair, and then handed her a wet towel.\r\n “I’m sorry,” she said, wiping her face with the towel.\r\n He shook his head.  “I’m sorry for her.  Abusive relationships are a terrible thing.  Psychological abuse is almost as bad and just as addictive.  I think people stay in it, or go back, so they can turn it around, and convince their abuser that they’re nice people and don’t deserve it.  They always get blamed.  And sometimes they get killed.  She just wasn’t strong enough, or healthy enough I guess, not to see him again.”  They both knew it happened all too often.  Francesca went back to the bed and lay down.  The thought of getting up was too much for her.  She wanted to lie there forever, as Chris sat on the bed next to her and stroked her hair.\r\n ***\r\n Marya and Charles-Edouard had just come back from a walk in her garden, and were starting to make breakfast when Chris called on Marya’s cell phone.  It was sitting on her desk, and she didn’t rush to get it.  She wasn’t expecting any important calls, she wanted to enjoy Charles-Edouard, and she was still in vacation mode.  She didn’t recognize the caller’s number when she picked up her phone, but she answered anyway, and was surprised to hear Chris’s voice.\r\n “Hi, Marya,” he said in a hoarse, somber voice.  He hadn’t gotten much sleep, and had watched Francesca for most of the night.  She had woken several times in tears.  He was tired and sad.\r\n “What a nice surprise,” Marya said happily.  “How’s Ian?  Where are you both?  I’m still in Vermont.”  She hadn’t spoken to him since they’d all left New York for the summer.\r\n “I’m in New York with Francesca,” Chris said quietly, as Francesca listened.  She had asked him to make the call.  “Ian’s at the Vineyard.  I’m going back for him in a couple of days.”\r\n “Is something wrong?  Is Francesca okay?”  It seemed odd to Marya that he would be with her, or said it that way, and he sounded upset.\r\n “She got back yesterday, and I’m sorry to call you, but something terrible happened at the house.  Eileen was killed a few days ago, probably by Brad.”\r\n “Oh my God, how awful.”  Tears instantly filled Marya’s eyes, imagining it.  She was such a sweet, silly, innocent young girl.  Charles-Edouard was watching her and was instantly concerned, with a question in his eyes.  “Did Francesca find her?”  She hoped not.  She couldn’t imagine a more traumatic scene than that.\r\n “She thought something was wrong when she walked in.  She called me, and I told her to wait outside and call the police.  They found her.  She was dead in her room.  He strangled and beat her.  They have him in custody now.  We have to identify him today.”  He didn’t tell her that Francesca had identified the body the day before.  Francesca was lying on the bed, listening to their conversation, with her eyes closed, deathly pale, and he was holding her hand.  They were two very sad friends, and he was glad to be there with her.\r\n “Do you want me to come down?  We could be there in a few hours.”  He noticed the “we” but thought she was confused, with all the strong emotions of the terrible news about Eileen.\r\n “There’s not much you can do.  We’re okay.”  He said it, but neither of them felt it.\r\n “Are you staying at the house?”  The idea of that was shocking, and she wasn’t sure what they would do.\r\n “We’re at the Gansevoort,” he said calmly.  And the police had given them the name of a service that specialized in cleaning up crime scenes.  Once they had all the evidence\r\n they needed, and had taken photographs, the service would come in and strip any evidence of the crime.  It would take a few days.  If necessary, they would repaint the room.  That happened more frequently when there were gunshots involved.  It sounded like a grim job to him.  “Everything should be in order by the time you get back.”  But in order or not, Eileen would never be there again.  Francesca had already decided that morning that she didn’t want anyone else in that room.  She never wanted to see it again herself, it would make her too sad.  She had genuinely liked Eileen, despite her foolishness with men, and had taken her under her wing and into her home.  And now she was dead.\r\n “I’m so sorry,” Marya said again.  “I don’t want to bother Francesca, but if there’s anything I can do, call me.  I’ll get in the car and be there in a few hours if it will help.  I’ll try to come back in a few days.  Did someone call her parents?”\r\n “The police.  They’re cremating the body after the autopsy, to send the ashes to her parents.  There’s no funeral in New York.”\r\n “Maybe we can have a little service of our own,” Marya said vaguely, too shocked to think of anything right now.  She reminded him to send her love to Francesca, and they hung up.\r\n “What happened?”  Charles-Edouard asked her with a look of concern when she hung up.\r\n “Eileen, the little girl on the top floor whom you met, was killed at the house.  Beaten and strangled.”\r\n “By a burglar?”\r\n “They think it was by a man she went out with.  They have him in custody and are charging him with the murder.  He beat her up very badly twice before.”  Marya looked sick.  She sat down on the couch with a distant expression, and Charles-Edouard sat down next to her and put an arm around her and held her.  It was a sad beginning to the first day of their new life.  Beginnings and endings, the birth of a relationship and the death of a young woman.  The bittersweetness of life.  And this was very bitter.  Marya looked up at him and then sank into his arms and cried.\r\n ***\r\n The lineup at the police station for the Sixth Precinct on West Tenth Street took forever to begin, and they were a motley group of men as they were led out.  There were two tall ones, a short one, and three of medium height.  All had tattoos.  One had long hair.  Three were being held on other charges, one was an undercover cop, one was on parole, and one was Brad.  They both recognized him instantly as he stood in profile and full face as he was directed.  The men in the lineup stood there shuffling, on the other side of a two- way mirror, and Chris and Francesca confirmed the identification without a doubt.  It was\r\n him.  And then the men were led out.  It was over.  And he would be arraigned the next day.  After that, Chris and Francesca were free to leave.\r\n They walked back to the hotel and needed the air.  Ian called Chris while they were walking, and his father said everything was fine, and Francesca sent her love.  He had told him he was going to New York to do some work, and to help Francesca at the house.  He didn’t want him to worry that something had happened to his mother in jail.  Ian was always worried about her, with good reason.  But now she had been charged with manslaughter.  And Chris doubted that her father would get her out of this one.  And no one had been able to stop, sway, or save Eileen.  Women who were bent on destroying themselves usually did, as Chris knew too well.\r\n The police had told them that the house should be cleaned up by midweek.  They were planning to stay at the hotel till then.  Chris had taken his own room before they left for the lineup.  And he didn’t care if he used it or not, this way he had the option, and if he sat in a chair in Francesca’s room every night, he didn’t mind that either.  That’s why he had come from the Vineyard, to do anything for her that he could.  They steered a wide berth of the house on their walk, and Francesca wasn’t sure if she wanted to see it again.  She wondered if this would haunt them forever, or if they could live there in peace now.  She wasn’t sure.\r\n She hadn’t eaten since the day before, and Chris finally convinced her to go to Da Silvano for some pasta.  They gave them a table outside in the usual hustle-bustle of the popular restaurant, and she couldn’t touch her food.  All she could think of was Eileen.  They walked back to the hotel after that, went to Francesca’s room, and Chris turned on the TV.  There was a baseball game on, and as he watched it from a chair next to the bed, she fell asleep.  She stirred several times, had nightmares once or twice, and got up to go to the bathroom, and other than that, she slept until morning.  He slept in the chair, fully dressed, with the TV on.  But they both felt better the next day.\r\n They ordered room service, and Marya called to see how they were.  She talked to Francesca this time, and they both cried for Eileen.  It made Francesca miss Marya more than ever.  She hadn’t said anything about the new developments with Charles-Edouard, their good news didn’t seem appropriate now in the face of their collective grief.\r\n “Do you want to come back to the Vineyard with me for a few days?”  Chris suggested over breakfast, but Francesca didn’t.\r\n “I don’t know what I want to do,” she said, still looking dazed.  “I don’t want to see people.  I have to open the gallery and get back to work.”  She was grateful for the distraction.  She could also stay at her father’s house in Connecticut, if she needed to get away.  He and Avery had just returned from Aspen.\r\n She called Avery that afternoon and told her what had happened.  She was horrified.  “Maybe roommates weren’t such a great idea after all,” Avery said quietly.  She was\r\n so sorry for Francesca, and wondered if the house would be forever tainted for her now.  Francesca was mulling over the same thing.  She wasn’t sure.  She’d have to see how it felt when she went back.  “What are you going to do now?  Sell the house?”  It seemed an extreme decision, but living in a house where a young woman they liked had been murdered wasn’t going to be easy either, for any of them.  And Francesca had a lot of sad memories in that house now.  Avery suggested that maybe it was no longer worth the struggle to keep it.  She asked if Francesca had called her mother.\r\n “Not yet,” she said with a sigh.  “I’m not sure I will.  She doesn’t need to know.  She’ll just hound me about it, tell me she was right all along about what a bad idea this was to keep the house and have roommates, and pressure me to sell.  I need to figure that out for myself, if that’s what I want.  I just don’t know yet.”\r\n “You will, at the right time.  It’s too soon, unless you’re sure you want to sell it.”\r\n “I’m not.  I still love the house.  I just hate what happened there.  I keep wondering if there was something else I could have done, or been stronger with her.  But I was her roommate, or landlady, not her mother.  I couldn’t forbid her to see him.  All I could do was tell her she couldn’t have him to the house, but she did anyway when I was gone. "

        "text":"Sometimes, however, you'll look at something that pings that vague recognition memory, that sense of being somehow familiar, and you'll want to place it, but we can't.  When your brain is firing on all cylinders, in a familiar environment, and in a routine that it often repeats, it's easy to use that sense of familiarity as a guide, and look back until you recall the origin of the memory.\r\n\r\n When your brain is tired, stressed, and surrounded by the unfamiliar day after day, it can't comb through the input that it's been exposed to, well enough for that feeling of familiarity to become solidified.  Instead, you start having intense feelings of familiarity brought on by things that are evocative of what you'veexperienced before   —   a particular configuration of coffee cups on a table, the face of someone who is tangentially related to someone you know, a particularly angled street   —   without being able to pin down why it feels so familiar.  The brain decides that it's clearly been here before, and satisfies itself with that explanation, instead of trying to find a better one.\r\n\r\n We came up with a word for this phenomenon, and déjà vu became an explanation unto itself.\r\n\r\n Via NY Times, Discover Magazine, and Scientific American.\r\n —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  — \r\n Original @: http://io9.com/5921310/how-to-give-people-the-feeling-of-deja-vu"
