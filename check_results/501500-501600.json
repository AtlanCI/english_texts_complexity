        "text":" It meant that she could see him, even regularly if she was in good condition, but she couldn’t decide where he went to school, or put him at risk again, if the judge granted supervised visitation.\r\n Having explained very unemotionally that Chris was not seeking to prevent visitation, as long as it was supervised by a third party appointed by the court, but only to gain full custody of his son legally, the attorney then read the essentials of the investigator’s report.  It was a list of horrifying acts, failures, episodes, misdeeds, dangerous interludes, and shocking displays of wanton and even criminal negligence.  Francesca knew a little from Chris, but what she knew was a drop in the bucket compared to the rest.\r\n Kimberly Harley had endangered her son in every possible way hundreds of times.  And Chris had been fighting her and trying to protect Ian for years.  The courts had always tried to respect the fact that she was his mother.  But the accumulation of evidence was overwhelming now.  All of what Chris’s lawyer was telling them was new to the court, and some of it had been new to him.  According to witnesses who had signed statements for them, she had left Ian with other drug addicts, abandoned him in truck stops and restaurants where he was brought home by other people, forgot she had him with her and left him by the side of highways, dropped him when he was a baby because she was on\r\n drugs, which Chris knew, forgot him on the roof of her car as an infant, where Chris had rescued him before she drove off, left him in crack houses, left him with a dead body, forgot to feed him for days, had attempted suicide several times in front of him, and pointed a loaded gun at him intending to kill him and then herself, and another addict had taken the gun away from her and saved Ian’s life.  The attorney said that Ian had called 911 for her countless times when she OD’d.  The list went on and on and on and on.  It no longer mattered that Chris’s lawyer was unemotional and used none of the bells and whistles the female attorney had.  It was better this way.  His lack of emotion was far more effective.  They were cold hard facts, pages and pages and pages of them, with police reports and signed witness statements attached.  Francesca looked behind her at Kim’s father, and he looked like he wanted to kill Chris’s attorney for telling the truth about his daughter.  It was the most damning evidence any of them had ever heard and couldn’t be denied.  Listening to it, and knowing Ian, Francesca thought Kim deserved a lot worse than prison.  She had no idea how Ian had survived it, and it was no longer surprising that Chris was relationship-phobic.  Married to a woman like that, constantly endangering the life of their son, even when he was an infant  —  how could he ever trust anyone again?  There were tears in Francesca’s eyes as she listened.  The list of horrors finally ended, and Chris’s attorney approached the bench and handed a copy of all of it to the judge.  He was sitting silently and stared at Chris.  He then asked the attorneys to come into chambers.  Francesca whispered to Chris and asked if the judge knew that Kim was currently being charged with manslaughter, and he nodded.  Chris was sitting there stone-faced, trying not to remember vividly each incident where she had endangered Ian.  She was a public menace, and Chris had said for years that she belonged in prison.\r\n Both lawyers went into the judge’s chambers as soon as he left the bench, and Francesca leaned toward Chris again.\r\n “Now what?”\r\n “He can either tell us his ruling today, or he can submit it in writing after he considers the case and reads what we filed.  Most judges usually do it in writing, so no one punches them out in the courtroom.  People get pretty heated up about custody hearings.”  It was easy to see why after what she’d just heard.\r\n “That was some list,” she said sadly, and Chris nodded.  The investigator had done a terrific job.  Poor Ian.  Her own mother had been an embarrassment to her all her life, but never a danger.  Ian’s mother had risked his life from the time he was three months old when she went back to drugs, and had been on and off them ever since.  Francesca’s heart ached for him, and for Chris, who was still trying to protect his son.\r\n The attorneys came out of chambers ten minutes later.  There was no expression whatsoever on Chris’s attorney’s face as he led them out of the courtroom.  Kim’s lawyer had gone straight to her father in the back of the courtroom, and they were conferring with\r\n bowed heads, as he pointed emphatically in the direction of the judge.  He didn’t look happy, but she had given a good performance, and that’s all it was.  Theater, not law, and not justice for Ian.\r\n Chris’s attorney escorted them outside, at a rapid pace.  They were at the bottom of the courthouse steps before he turned to face them.  He had been afraid that someone might call the press, so he got them out of the courtroom as fast as they could.\r\n “What happened in chambers?”  Chris asked him with a worried look.  His attorney smiled at Chris and touched his shoulder.  “You have sole custody of Ian, Chris.  The judge said he doesn’t want to hear another word from them in this case.  He said that as long as he’s on the bench, you’ll have custody of Ian, and he said that the next time she endangers him, he’s putting her in jail.  He said he has no idea how she kept joint custody for this long.”  Tears rolled down Chris’s cheeks as he listened to the words, and Francesca choked on a sob.  “Now get out of here before someone figures out who you are and calls the press.  Her father won’t this time.”  Chris beamed at him and thanked him, and then hailed a cab, and he and Francesca jumped in.  Francesca burst into tears and hugged him as the cab drove away.  It had been a total victory for Chris, and Charles- Edouard and Marya were waiting for them when they got home.  They knew immediately when they saw Chris’s face and Francesca’s tears.\r\n “Thank God,” Marya said as she hugged him, and so did Charles-Edouard.  It was an enormous relief to all of them.  And Chris reminded them again not to say anything to Ian when he got home, and then he went upstairs to change into a sweater and jeans.  He was shaken and thrilled.  Ian was all his.  At last.  She could never do any of it again.  The horror was over.  Ian was safe.  That was all Chris had ever wanted.  And she had risked his life so many times.  The judge had also approved court-supervised visitation by a third party.  They had won it all.\r\n Francesca tried to tell Marya about it, and she was horrified even by the few things Francesca remembered from the long list.  It had been a total victory for Chris and above all for Ian.  His mother would never put him in harm’s way again.\r\n It was even more meaningful and a more important victory when Chris saw an item in the paper a week later.  Francesca could see his teeth clench and his jaw work as he read the piece, and she was worried.  She asked him what it was when he finished reading, and he silently handed her the paper.  This time Kim’s father’s attorneys had won, for his daughter, if not her son.\r\n They had somehow claimed, and probably paid people vast sums to corroborate the story, that the addict who had OD’d next to her was a dealer, that he had endangered her life and not the reverse.  Because the deceased was allegedly a criminal, it shed new light on her guilt.  They had claimed psychiatric issues for Kim, delicate health, and everything\r\n else they could think of to plead her felony manslaughter charges down to a misdemeanor.  The district attorney had been willing to plea-bargain with her.  The judge had meted out a six-month sentence, with credit for time served since she’d been there, and time off for good behavior.  Kim was not going to prison.  She would be out of jail in a few weeks and home for Thanksgiving.  The article stated that she would spend time at a famous country club rehab to restore her health after her time in jail.  She could leave any time she wanted, and knowing her, Chris was sure she’d be calling soon and wanting visitation with Ian.  But at least now it would be with court-appointed supervision.  Chris was furious that she’d been allowed to plead to lesser charges and was getting out of jail.  She’d be back in his face in no time, wanting to see Ian and screw up his life again.\r\n “I didn’t think he’d pull it off this time,” Chris said, looking livid, referring to her father.  “She belongs in prison.  She’s a danger to herself and everyone around her.”\r\n “Yes, but at least now Ian is protected,” Francesca said sensibly.  “You have sole custody, and she’ll have supervised visits.”\r\n “I was hoping she’d be gone for a few years,” he said, looking grim.  It made Francesca more grateful than ever that he had won at the custody hearing.  No one could have denied or refuted that list.\r\n Chris put the paper in the garbage, where Ian wouldn’t see it, and then he went back upstairs to work without saying another word.  It was no secret how much he hated his ex- wife.  And Francesca felt sorry for both of them that in a few weeks she’d be back on the streets, and in Ian’s world.\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 18\r\n\r\n IN THE WEEKS after the custody hearing, their romance burst into full bloom.  Chris started to relax, and make his peace with the fact that Kim wasn’t going to prison, and would be back, wanting to see Ian.  Francesca reminded him that there was nothing he could do about Ian’s mother.  He had won a major victory.  He had full control and sole custody, and all their visits would happen with supervision.  Ian would be safe from now on.  It allowed Chris to finally think about something else.  He was spending more and more time with Francesca.  They were in her living room and bedroom at night, after Ian went to sleep, but they didn’t dare do more than kiss, in case he woke up and came upstairs.\r\n They went on wonderful outings together on weekends, the Bronx Zoo, the Staten Island ferry, the boat museum at the tip of Manhattan.  She took them to see her father and Avery in Connecticut, and Chris and Henry got on well.  The three of them wore costumes and went trick-or-treating on Halloween, and watched the parade in the Village.  Francesca hadn’t had as much fun in years.  The next morning, as Ian lay in bed with a plastic pumpkin full of candy, Chris came upstairs to find her in her room.\r\n “I’ll trade you two Milky Ways for a Snickers,” he said, as he walked into the room.\r\n “No deal.  The lady on Jane Street gave me the dark Snickers bars.  That’s worth at least six Milky Ways, and a bag of peanut M&M’s.  I saw you slip two of them into your pocket at our last stop.”\r\n “You’re a crook,” Chris accused her as he kissed her.  He was starving for her.  Years of monastic solitude had finally caught up with him.  “I have a proposition for you,” he whispered as he ran a hand under her sweater, and she caught her breath.  “I want to go away for the weekend with you.”  They didn’t dare get too passionate, with Ian so near, but they had come close.  Very close.\r\n “When?”\r\n “Now!”  he said, and she laughed.  They had Ian on their own for the weekend, because Marya and Charles-Edouard had gone back to Vermont for a few days to work on the book.  “How about next weekend?  Maybe Marya will baby-sit.”  He sounded desperate.\r\n “I’ll ask her when they get back.”\r\n “If she won’t do it, I warn you, I may go crazy and rip your clothes off in a public place of my choosing.”\r\n “Take it easy.  We’ll work something out,” she said, and teased him as they kissed.  They were both anxious for an adult weekend somewhere where they didn’t have to behave, be circumspect, or think about Ian.  They needed time for themselves now.  They\r\n had been very respectable for almost two months.  It was long enough.  Francesca asked Marya on Sunday night when they got home from Vermont.  As always, she was delighted help out.  She loved Ian, and heartily approved of their\r\n romance.  “Where are you two going?”  She was happy for them.  There were two happy\r\n couples in the house now.  Charles-Edouard was wonderful to her, and promised her he was a reformed man.  He wanted no other woman but her.  Francesca had long since told her about her father, who had been exemplary ever since he had married Avery.  She told Marya it just took the right woman.\r\n “We haven’t figured out where we’re going.  I wanted to see if you’d mind baby- sitting first.”  And then Marya had an idea.\r\n “Why don’t you go to my place in Vermont?  It’s quiet and peaceful.  It is beautiful this time of year, even if it’s chilly.  And it’s nicer than being in a hotel.”  Francesca loved the idea, and so did Chris.  They made their plan.  They were going to leave on Friday afternoon and come back on Sunday night.  It was a long drive, but it was worth it.  They thought of nothing else all week, and Marya was busy making plans with Ian.  They were going to a movie, a play, and a museum.  Ian was delighted, and Chris and Francesca could hardly wait.  Francesca got one of her artists to work at the gallery for her.  They were covered.\r\n It felt like a getaway scene in a movie as they drove away from the house on Charles Street late Friday afternoon.  There was rush-hour traffic, but neither of them cared.  They had actually pulled it off.  Even Ian paid no attention as they left.  He kissed both of them, and didn’t even ask where they were going for the weekend.  He was too busy with Marya.  And Chris promised to call him.\r\n They both started laughing as they left the city, and congratulated each other on having done it.\r\n “I kept worrying all week that something would happen and we couldn’t leave.  Like Ian getting chicken pox,” Francesca said with relief as he drove.\r\n “So did I,” Chris admitted.  “I was sure one of us would get sick, or Marya couldn’t do it, or Kim would break out of jail or go nuts.  We have two whole days together!”  he said victoriously.  “I can’t believe it!”\r\n “Neither can I!”  She was beaming.\r\n Even the drive was relaxing and enjoyable.  They stopped at a little inn on the way up and had dinner.  And then got back on the road and continued driving to Vermont.  They got to Marya’s place just before midnight.  It was a pretty little house with an orchard, tall trees, and beautiful grounds.  Francesca and Chris were thrilled to be there.  Marya and Charles-Edouard had been enjoying spending time there lately and he loved the area.  It was a perfect counterpoint to their city life in New York.  In France, he had a\r\n farm in Normandy, which he had just given to his wife.  He wanted to buy another one with Marya, when they were in France next summer.  He liked the country better than the beach.  He loved her home in Vermont.\r\n It looked and felt like a honeymoon cottage as Chris unlocked the door and turned off the alarm.  And Francesca looked around at all of Marya’s pretty things.  It was a beautiful room with wood paneling and a fireplace.  And upstairs, the guest room had a big canopied bed.  They set their suitcases down, and before Francesca could even take her coat off, Chris had her on the bed and was kissing her.  They were both out of breath and frantic with passion within minutes.  They had waited so long for this, and they had wanted each other so much in the past weeks.  They had been circumspect for Ian’s sake, but there were no constraints on them now.  They were both naked within minutes and under the covers, learning each other’s bodies and fondling each other.  They were both aroused, and neither of them could wait any longer.  Francesca welcomed him, and Chris plunged into her, burning with desire.  It was the hottest, fastest, most unbridled sex either of them had ever had.  They were like two starving people who had finally found food after years on a desert island.  They came at the same time, and lay breathless and panting half off the bed afterward, and they both started to laugh.\r\n “I think I’m too old for this,” Chris said, trying to catch his breath, and she was lying on top of him, dripping with perspiration, her eyes closed, with a huge smile on her face.\r\n “I think I died and went to heaven,” she said, as out of breath as he was.  It had been worth waiting for, and they rolled over in bed and looked at each other.  “Do you suppose it’s like this for Charles-Edouard and Marya?”  she asked him, propped up on one elbow, admiring him, as she traced a lazy finger down his chest, and he laughed.\r\n “I hope not.  It would kill them.”  He kissed her then, and she fondled him.  He was totally sated, but easily aroused again.  He had years to catch up on, and it had been a long time for her too.  They made up for it that night.  And again the next morning.  Neither of them wanted to get out of bed.  They just wanted to lie in each other’s arms.\r\n Francesca went downstairs to make them coffee, and there were some rolls in the freezer that she heated up for them in the micro-wave.  And then they went back to bed.  There wasn’t a house around them for miles, and the view was beautiful.  They finally got up and walked around the property, just so they could tell Marya they had, and then they went back to bed for the afternoon.\r\n And they called Marya to thank her for the house and tell her how much they loved\r\n it.\r\n “I’m so glad you do,” she said happily.  “It’s very romantic, isn’t it?”  She giggled like a girl, and Francesca smiled.\r\n “Yes, it is,” she agreed.

        "text":"Even when you take the time to set clear goals, visualize success, and break big goals down into projects and action steps, it can be difficult to get yourself to take action consistently until your goal is 100% complete.  Crossing the starting line is much easier than crossing the finish line.\r\n\r\n Your overall results in life largely depend on your ability to follow through until you achieve completion.  Many projects produce essentially zero results if they’re 90% complete.  The key results only appear when you reach 100% completion.\r\n\r\n For example, if I write 90% of an article and don’t publish it, it produces no value other than being a private journaling exercise.  The value cannot be delivered until the article is 100% complete and published.\r\n\r\n Incompletes\r\n Incompletes can produce feelings like dissatisfaction, discomfort, stress, worry, shame, and regret.  We worry that we may have wasted too much time and energy on such projects with little to show for our efforts.\r\n\r\n One way to avoid racking up too many incompletes is to give more careful thought to which particular projects you’re willing to accept in the first place.  Having too many active projects at the same time makes it hard to complete them.  It’s like trying to juggle too many balls at once.  You end up dropping every ball.\r\n\r\n One reason we take on too many projects is the desire for variety.  Working on the same project day after day can get boring.  Another reason is that projects tend to be easier and more motivating in the beginning.  Starting a new project is often fun.  It’s much more difficult to work through the middling grind of a project and see it through to completion.\r\n\r\n Learning Your Lessons\r\n In order to move forward into a better place of achievement, we first need to absorb the lessons from our incompletes.  If you’re carrying around some psychological baggage from past incompletes, then take a moment to forgive yourself for those mistakes.  You screwed up.  It’s okay.  You’re human.\r\n\r\n At the same time, it’s wise to allow a little of that sting from past incompletes to hang around.  That feeling of regret is there for a reason.  It serves as an ongoing warning that we don’t want to get into similar situations again.  The feeling of regret has a positive message, encouraging you to avoid starting too many projects if you won’t complete them.\r\n\r\n Instead of trying to drug this seemingly negative feeling with excess food or drink, turn towards it.  Give it your full attention for a moment, and listen to what it has to say.\r\n\r\n Ask yourself, What lessons can I learn from my incompletes?  How can this make me stronger?\r\n\r\n You might hear something like this: I’m tired of wasting time on projects that never go anywhere.  Obviously I’m only going to get results if I complete something.  So before I set any new goals or tackle any new projects, I’d better be sure I’m going to see them through to completion.  If circumstances really do change in unexpected ways, and the project becomes obsolete before it’s done, then it’s okay to dump it and move on to something else.  But if the original decision is still sound, then let’s keep pushing through to the end and get it done.\r\n\r\n I need to avoid overloading myself with too many projects at once.  Ideally I should keep things simple and stick to one serious project at a time, perhaps two projects for variety.  When I’m done, then I can add something new.  But trying to do 10 things at once obviously isn’t working.  I need to stop saying yes to new projects when I still have important incompletes to close.\r\n\r\n Abandoning Failed Strategies\r\n Notice which strategies you’ve already tried to get yourself to take action consistently.  If you’ve tried something a few times, and it has never worked, stop doing it.\r\n\r\n Quite often people get into circular patterns where they keep trying the same failed strategies every few years, hoping that somehow things will be different.  That doesn’t work.\r\n\r\n An example of a strategy that has never worked for me is trying to associate more pain to incompletion and more pleasure to completing a project, such as by using NLP techniques.  I can safely abandon this strategy because I know it’s a dead end.  My mind is smart enough to see right through these silly attempts at conditioning.  It might work for a dog, but my mind resists such obvious attempts to make it less conscious.  I always know that I have a choice.  So I don’t use or revisit this strategy because it’s ineffective.\r\n\r\n Consciously acknowledging this realization helps me avoid using the wrong approach.  When I feel overwhelmed, instead of trying to get myself to feel more motivated and work harder and faster, I say no more often, cancel some items, and pay more attention to simplifying my life.\r\n\r\n What are your failed strategies?  Are you willing to drop them, so you can free your mind to figure out something more intelligent that might actually work?\r\n\r\n Resting in the Space of Possibility\r\n One positive step forward is to recognize that it’s at least possible for you to complete projects, even very difficult ones.\r\n\r\n Perhaps if you think back, you can recall some projects you did actually complete, and you can remember the results you got from them.  Maybe it was something as simple as completing a school project and getting a good grade on it.\r\n\r\n Take a moment to acknowledge that for whatever goal or project you’d like to tackle next, it is at least possible for you to complete it in a timely manner.  You aren’t attempting the impossible.  There is a way to get it done.  The action steps are doable.  The project is achievable.\r\n\r\n Accepting the Difficult Work\r\n Worthwhile projects don’t normally complete themselves.  A good project will frequently require a serious investment of time and energy.  Even if the work is enjoyable, you may still need to put in many hours to see it through to the end.\r\n\r\n Almost every meaningful project will include some unpleasant or difficult tasks.  You aren’t going to enjoy those tasks, but they’re essential for the project’s completion.\r\n\r\n You have the option of only doing what’s easy, but if you stick with what’s easy all the time, most of your projects will be pretty low on the value scale.  Even if you complete them, they aren’t going to make much of a difference.\r\n\r\n If you wish to stop having so many incompletes and see more of your projects through to completion, you must accept that certain tasks will be difficult and to decide to do them anyway.\r\n\r\n It’s easy to say that you’re committed to completing a project.  Anyone can say they’re committed.  But a real commitment means that you’re willing to do the dirty work.  It may slow you down.  It may frustrate you.  You may need to take more breaks in order to get through it.  But when you’re committed, you accept the existence of difficult work, and you decide to push through it regardless of the difficulty.  This is a key difference between starting projects and finishing them.\r\n\r\n Most of the perceived difficulty has nothing to do with the true nature of the task anyway.  You’re simply interpreting the task in a way that creates resistance.  So a commitment to complete difficult tasks is really a commitment to face and overcome your own resistance.  It’s a commitment to overcome the limiting beliefs that bias you against doing certain types of work.\r\n\r\n To complete a project, you must eventually do the steps required for project completion.  If you don’t feel like doing a particular step, and you use your feelings to justify avoidance of that step, then your project will remain stuck in an incomplete state.  A better approach is to recognize that a task is just a task, and it’s subject to many different interpretations as to how pleasant or unpleasant it may be, so instead of looking at it from a perspective that creates unpleasantness, you can choose to regard the task as simply one more stepping stone on par with all the others.\r\n\r\n Asserting Your Dominant Will\r\n There are countless techniques you can use to push through inner resistance when the going gets tough.  I’ve shared many of them in previous articles like Do It Now and Overcoming Procrastination.\r\n\r\n It’s nice to have a toolkit of techniques, but that isn’t enough by itself.  Many people know plenty of anti-procrastination techniques, but they can’t get themselves to apply them consistently.  The problem is if once you fall into the trap of procrastinating, you can just as easily procrastinate on overcoming procrastination.  Anti-procrastination techniques don’t self-activate.  The nature of this problem is that it encourages you to resist solving it.\r\n\r\n A strategy I’ve found that works well is more of a mindset than a technique.  It’s the mindset that says, No matter what, my conscious will is ultimately in charge, and it always has the ability to step in and take command immediately.\r\n\r\n When you tackle a challenging goal, you’re going to catch yourself going dark now and then.  At some point your conscious will steps in and says, Hey, you’re procrastinating.  This is a waste of time.  That barely noticeable voice is your inner alarm clock.  Instead of hitting the snooze button, pull that thought into the center of your consciousness and amplify it.  Give it your full attention.\r\n\r\n When you give that thought your full attention and let its voice be heard, it gets louder: WTF, you lazy ass!  You don’t need to be checking the news right now.  You have much more important things to be doing.  Get your ass back to work!\r\n\r\n The mindset aspect here has to do with your relationship to that voice.\r\n\r\n When you succumb to procrastination for long periods of time, and that voice shows up, you’ll have a tendency to push it away.  You define the part of you that procrastinates as “me” and the part of you that wants to get some real work done as “not me,” as if the strong part (not you) is trying to push the weaker part (you) into action.  As long as you maintain these kinds of inner relationships, procrastination will be your constant companion.\r\n\r\n To overcome procrastination, do the opposite.  When that alarm clock voice shows up, realize that this strong voice is the real you.  And the lazy procrastinator is not you.  When you procrastinate, you go dark and become something less than your true self.  When you wake up and recommit to your goals and projects, that’s the real you.\r\n\r\n Self-Dominance vs. Self-Abuse\r\n When you wrap your identity into the part of you that wants to procrastinate, you’ll have a tendency to beat yourself up.  When you look back and realize you wasted a lot of time, you’re identifying with the part of you that procrastinates.  So when you get frustrated with that part, you’re getting frustrated with yourself.  And when you beat up that part of yourself for its bad habits, you’re abusing yourself.\r\n\r\n This won’t help.  It will simply perpetuate the cycle and keep you stuck.\r\n\r\n The problem is that when you self-identify with the part of you that procrastinates, and then you beat up that part of yourself, you’re lowering your self-esteem.  You’re saying to yourself, I’m such a loser.  I suck.  I can’t get anything done.\r\n\r\n This is self-abuse.  It cannot help you.  Don’t do this.\r\n\r\n Avoid self-identifying with the part of you that procrastinates.  Imagine that the part of you that procrastinates is the animal part of you.  It’s prehistoric baggage.  It has many positive aspects that keep you alive, but you can’t let this part of you run amok.  Your conscious mind needs to keep a tight leash on it.\r\n\r\n The real you is the part of you that’s conscious and aware.  This is the part of you that’s capable of making high-level decisions.  This is the part of you that sets goals and takes on projects that aren’t essential for survival.\r\n\r\n Your arms are a part of you, but you probably wouldn’t say that your identity is that of an arm.  Your conscious will dominates your arms.  You can wave them around, use them to pick up objects, train them to get stronger  —  whatever you desire.  You’re the boss of your arms.\r\n\r\n Similarly, you’re the boss of the lazy part of yourself that wants to procrastinate.  Acknowledge that it’s there.  Recognize that it’s a part of you, but it can’t fully define you, just as your arm can’t define your body.  Appreciate the good it does for you, like directing your fight or flight impulse to keep you alive in emergency situations.  But whatever you do, don’t give your power away to this part of you.  It is your servant.  It isn’t meant to be your Master.\r\n\r\n In order to shift yourself to a place of achievement, you must claim your role as Master over the part of you that wants to be lazy and expedient.  You have the power to be dominant over this part of you.  Your conscious will is so much stronger.\r\n\r\n Strengthening Your Will\r\n Just like a muscle, your conscious will grows stronger when you exercise it regularly, and it atrophies when you fail to exercise it.\r\n\r\n Fortunately, no matter how weak you’ve allowed yourself to become in this area, you can always train yourself back up to a place of strength.\r\n\r\n Practicing self-dominance can actually be fun.  A good way to practice is to verbalize your commands to yourself out loud.  Tell yourself what to do, as if commanding the lazy part to get in line.\r\n\r\n For example, if you have a tendency to want to linger in bed when your alarm goes off, say to yourself, On your feet now!  Get dressed and brush your teeth.  Imagine that this commanding voice is your true self commanding aspects of your lower self.  Your fully conscious self is commanding parts of you that are less conscious.  See the truth that the real you really does want to get out of bed.  You want to have that experience today.  Choosing to do the opposite isn’t really you.\r\n\r\n No matter how much you struggle with this, that’s okay.  It’s a lifelong challenge, and perfection isn’t a realistic standard.  Sometimes you’ll go dark.  But when you eventually rise again to a new level of consciousness, strive to maintain it as long as you can.\r\n\r\n I’m taking a 10-week course where the current assignment is to check in with myself every hour for two full weeks (an hourly alarm can serve as a reminder).  At least once per hour I must pause and reflect on what I’m thinking and doing in that moment.  Am I behaving wisely?  Or have I slipped into unconsciousness?  Am I creating my life, or am I merely reacting?\r\n\r\n I’d encourage you to try a similar challenge.  Whenever you catch yourself slipping into negative emotions, unconscious behavior, or self-identification with laziness and procrastination, take a moment to reassert your dominant will.  Take stock of who you really are, and issue the proper commands for what you are to do in this moment.\r\n\r\n Don’t project your higher self as something outside of you.  Embrace the beingness of your higher self in each moment.  Your higher self is the real you."

        "text":" Be willing to lose what doesn’t matter, so we can all gain what does matter.  Jobs don’t matter, but creativity does.  Paying our bills doesn’t matter, but keeping our bodies healthy does.  Getting good grades in school doesn’t matter, but preserving and passing on our collective knowledge does.  Start reorganizing your life around what matters, and be willing to shed what doesn’t.\r\n\r\n Try not to be too attached to remnants of the old cellular consciousness, like the money you have, the job you do, and the home you live in.  The more you cling to those things, the more stressed out you’ll be.  Just notice that these are all artificial cellular level concerns.  What’s important is that humanity is evolving in a very positive way.  You can resist that change and see your old goals fall apart, or you can flow with it and actively participate in the process of change.\r\n\r\n For those who are waking up, life is going to become much easier in a way.  Your life will explode with opportunities to learn, love, share, and grow.  The good stuff will come from your alignment with the expansion of universal consciousness.  But it’s important to keep the perspective of what really matters.  Money doesn’t matter.  Bloodstream/Internet Marketing is pointless and shallow.  Waking people up and consciously co-creating something amazing is what matters.\r\n\r\n When you align yourself with this higher level consciousness, abundance will flow through your life with relative ease.  However, this type of abundance will be universal level abundance, not human level abundance.  It doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily have more money, a more luxurious home, or more possessions.  That kind of stuff just doesn’t matter and represents artificial needs, not real needs.  This level of abundance means that you’ll be experiencing the benefits of being in a healthier body.  You’ll get more of what really matters  —  more growth opportunities, more love, more joy, more inner peace.\r\n\r\n Focus on your true needs.  What do you need to feel abundant?  You need to keep your body healthy with healthy food, sunshine, and clean air and water.  You need a reasonable degree of safety.  You need love and belongingness.  You need self esteem.  You need an outlet for your creativity.  Your true needs are quite simple in fact, and they’re easier to satisfy than your artificial needs.  You don’t need the latest tech gadget.  You don’t need a job or an income.  You don’t need to get married.  You don’t need to master Bloodstream Marketing.\r\n\r\n Your artificial needs may not align well with humanity’s larger concerns.  But your true needs certainly do align.  It’s in humanity’s best interests to keep its best servants healthy, happy, and prosperous.  In that sense, it you dedicate yourself to serving this greater body, it will surely watch your back.\r\n\r\n Aligning With Higher Level Desires\r\n In order to tap into this greater flow of abundance, you have to tap into higher level desires.\r\n\r\n First, recognize that your human level goals are beginning to bore you.  No matter how important you try to make them, you can’t get motivated to work on them.  You just can’t get that worked up about making money beyond a certain point.  People may tell you it’s important to have specific financial goals, but when you try to do this for yourself, it makes you feel yucky inside.  You can’t get motivated to work on those kinds of goals.  They don’t inspire you.  And so you procrastinate and then beat yourself up.  It’s time to end this cycle.  It’s time to re-align your desires with something that actually matters to you.  You can set better goals than the human equivalent of stockpiling oxygen and sugar.\r\n\r\n Stop thinking about what you want for yourself as an individual.  Start thinking about what you want for humanity as a whole.\r\n\r\n In the past, you may have been hesitant to even think at that level.  Start thinking at that level now.\r\n\r\n What do you want for humanity itself?  Where would you like to see this larger body go during your lifetime and beyond?\r\n\r\n Do you want us to clean up the planet?  Explore outer space?  Improve our educational systems?  Stop fighting wars?\r\n\r\n Let yourself dream about what’s possible for humanity.  Notice that these dreams are much more impressive than anything you could possibly do as an individual.\r\n\r\n Become a billionaire?  Who cares?  Start a charity?  Big deal.  Discover a new planet?  Nice try.  When will you be ready to work on a real goal, a goal for humanity itself?\r\n\r\n Receiving Guidance\r\n The best part is that you don’t even need to figure this out yourself.  All you need to do is wake up to this higher level perspective, and then simply ping this universal consciousness to tell it you’re awake and ready to serve.  Ask it for guidance, and guidance will come.\r\n\r\n Just be aware that universal consciousness is frakkin powerful.  It’s way more powerful than human level consciousness.  When you tap into this resource and align yourself with it, your life is going to speed up.  At first it may seem like drinking from a firehouse.  It will take some time to get used to it.\r\n\r\n If you feel that the flow is too much for you, you can ask it to slow down.  I do this all the time.  When I’m feeling overwhelmed, I say to the universe aloud, “Okay… this is too fast.  Let’s slow this down for a week or two and give me a chance to catch my breath.”  Then when I’m ready, I ask it to speed up again.\r\n\r\n With practice you’ll get used to this faster pacing.  You’ll get used to things showing up when you need them.  You’ll get used to experiencing synchronicities almost every day.\r\n\r\n A synchronicity is no accident.  Universal consciousness knows what you need, perhaps even better than you do.  You really don’t even have to ask for your specific needs to be met once you ask to be a better servant of humanity.  As Jesus said, just say, “Not my will, but thy will be done.”\r\n\r\n Lately I’ve been holding off on setting specific goals for myself.  Instead I’ve been saying to the universe, “Bring me what you want me to work on, and also please bring me whatever you know I need for optimal health, happiness, and flow.”  And then I do my best to remain open-minded and detached from outcomes.  I let the universal consciousness guide me instead of having to set specific goals and intentions.  I still have an intention, but it’s simply to do what’s best for humanity as a whole.\r\n\r\n Partly I’m doing this because I’ve reached the point where any individual-level goal would bore me, and I wouldn’t be able to motivate myself to work on it.  I just don’t care that much about oxygen and sugar to make it the central focus of my life.  So I’m willing to risk things like losing my money, losing my home, having my relationships disrupted, etc. just for the opportunity to see where this flow leads.  And yet somehow when I move past this fear of losing stuff, I seem to gain much more than I lose.  As far as meeting my human needs goes, they’re all nicely satisfied and then some. "

        "text":"Despite this popular and critical success, particularly among a generation of young hippies and survivalists, the catalog was not intended to continue in publication for long, just long enough for the editors to complete a good overview of the available tools and resources, and for the word, and copies, to get out to everyone who needed them. [citation needed]\r\n [edit]Publication after 1972\r\n\r\n After 1972 the catalog was published sporadically.  Updated editions of The Last Whole Earth Catalog appeared periodically from 1971 to 1975, but only a few fully new catalogs appeared.  In 1974 the Whole Earth Epilog was published, which was intended as a \"volume 2\" to the Last Whole Earth Catalog.  In 1980, The Next Whole Earth Catalog (ISBN 0-394-70776-1) was published;  it was so well received that an updated second edition was published in 1981.\r\n There were two editions in the 1980s of the Whole Earth Software Catalog, a compendium for which Doubleday had bid $1.4 million for the trade paperback rights. [10]\r\n In 1986, The Essential Whole Earth Catalog (ISBN 0-385-23641-7) was published, and in 1988 the WEC was published on CD-ROM using an early version of hypertext. [11] In 1988, there was a WEC dedicated to Communications Tools.  A Whole Earth Ecolog was published in 1990, devoted exclusively to environmental topics.  Around this time there were special WECs on other topics (e.g., The Fringes of Reason in 1989).\r\n The last \"full\" WEC, entitled The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog (ISBN 0-06-251059-2), was published in 1994.\r\n A slender, but still \"A3\"-sized, 30th Anniversary Celebration WEC was published in 1998 as part of Issue 95 of the Whole Earth magazine (ISSN 0749-5056);  it reprinted the original WEC along with new material.  An important aspect of this copy of the first WEC was a limitation placed on it by book publishers: because \"Publishers begged [Whole Earth] not to reprint... their names anywhere near books they no longer carry\", all such information was placed at the back of the catalog.  This placement hampered a valuable function of the WEC: nudging publishers to keep featured seminal works in print."

Sure wish you\r\n weren't such a heavy sleeper.\r\n\r\n And now...\r\n\r\n ...if you please.\r\n\r\n One million dollars...\r\n\r\n ...Mr.  Bensonmum.\r\n\r\n Banzai, Pop!\r\n\r\n Very clever of you, Mr. Wang.\r\n\r\n Oh, yes.\r\n As you can see, I can see.\r\n\r\n So I see.\r\n\r\n Tell me, as the only survivor,\r\nhow did you deduce it was me?\r\n\r\n Went back to theory\r\n seldom used today:\r\n\r\nButler did it.\r\n\r\n I hadn't thought of that.\r\n\r\n How do you account for\r\n my dead body?\r\n\r\n Body made of plastic,\r\nsame as plastic cook.\r\n\r\n While we examine plastic butler...\r\n\r\n ...you murder Lionel Twain.\r\n\r\n You're a clever little\r\n laundry man, Mr. Wang.\r\n\r\n But not quite clever enough!\r\n\r\n I'll take that one million dollars,\r\nBensonmum...\r\n\r\n ...alias Irving Goldman.\r\n\r\n Irving Goldman?\r\n\r\n Yes.\r\n\r\n Irving Goldman was the attorney\r\n of the late Lionel Twain.\r\n\r\n Lionel Twain died five years ago.\r\n\r\n His body was discovered\r\n in Goldman's filing cabinet.\r\n\r\n Am I correct, Mr. Goldman?\r\n\r\n Yeah.  Correct, Miss Marbles.\r\n\r\n But how did you escape\r\n the poison gas?\r\n\r\n Quite simple.\r\n I covered my mouth...\r\n\r\n ...and let Miss Withers here\r\n breathe in all the gas.\r\n\r\n -Sicky-poo.\r\n -Yes, dear, I know.\r\n\r\n -The million dollars, please.\r\n -I wouldn't, Goldman.\r\n\r\n Or is it Goldman?\r\n\r\n Actually, it's Mr. Marvin Metzner.\r\n\r\n Marvin Metzner?\r\n\r\n Very good, Mr. Charleston.\r\n\r\n But how did you know?\r\n\r\n The bill in the dead butler's hand\r\n stating the weekend had been catered.\r\n\r\n -Only an accountant would keep that.\r\n -Get the money and let's go.\r\n\r\n Goldman died\r\n last month while skiing.\r\n\r\n He jumped 200 feet\r\n into a low-flying plane.\r\n\r\n I can't wait much longer.\r\n\r\n You've not lost your touch,\r\nMr. Charleston.\r\n\r\n But how did you elude\r\n the deadly scorpion?\r\n\r\n We didn't.\r\n He stung Dora.\r\n\r\n -We have 1 5 minutes to reach a doctor.\r\n -Explain later.\r\n\r\n We'll make it.  Never fear.\r\n The prize money.\r\n\r\n Belongs to me, monsieur.\r\n\r\n Marcel, being one of\r\n the world's strongest men...\r\n\r\n ...stopped your ceiling from crushing\r\n us at four feet, five inches.\r\n\r\n It may be months before\r\n we're able to straighten again...\r\n\r\n ...but a million dollars\r\n will buy a lot of back braces.\r\n\r\n Eh, Miss Irene Twain?\r\n\r\n Daughter of Lionel!\r\n\r\n What?\r\n\r\n I prefer to be called Rita.\r\n\r\n But how did you know?\r\n\r\n Never underestimate\r\n a Frenchman's nostrils, Miss Twain.\r\n\r\n At dinner tonight...\r\n\r\n ...I smelled your Chanel No. 5.\r\n\r\n You did away with all of them:\r\n\r\nMetzner, Goldman\r\n and your father.\r\n\r\n If you had your way...\r\n\r\n ...you'd do away with all men,\r\nwould you not, Miss Twain?\r\n\r\n Men who have made you suffer...\r\n\r\n ...because you were\r\n born with brains...\r\n\r\n ...talent, money, everything\r\n but that which you most desired:\r\n\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\n It is a statement of fact...\r\n\r\n ...that as a man you are passable,\r\nbut as a woman...\r\n\r\n ...you are a dog.\r\n\r\n That's your opinion, big boy.\r\n\r\n And now my money, please.\r\n\r\n With luck, I can still\r\n make dinner at Maxim's.\r\n\r\n I'd just order\r\n a tuna sandwich...\r\n\r\n ...because that dough is mine.\r\n\r\n That's right, I'm alive.\r\n\r\n Miss Skeffington\r\n dropped your bomb down the john.\r\n\r\n It blew up as she flushed.\r\n The seat missed her head by an inch.\r\n\r\n I'm all right, J.J.\r\n\r\n J.J.?\r\n\r\n That's right, folks.\r\n He outsmarted us all.\r\n\r\n Sitting behind that desk\r\n is the real Sam Diamond.\r\n\r\n My name is Loomis.\r\n\r\n J.J. Loomis.  I'm an actor.\r\n I do impressions.\r\n\r\n I did the Carson show\r\n six times last year.\r\n\r\n Diamond hired me for the weekend.\r\n\r\n Miss Skeffington\r\n is Vilma Norman.\r\n\r\n She's a cocktail waitress\r\n at the Water Bed Motel in Carmel.\r\n\r\n Diamond hated all of you.\r\n\r\n You're getting big money, and he\r\n had that office in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n If he proved he was number one,\r\nhe'd get your clients.\r\n\r\n But since I put\r\n all the pieces together...\r\n\r\n ...I figure that money belongs to me.\r\n\r\n Isn't that right, Mr. Diamond?\r\n\r\n Wrong.\r\n\r\n That would've been so obvious,\r\na child could have guessed.\r\n\r\n No, colleagues.\r\n What you seem to overlook...\r\n\r\n ...is the most simple\r\n and direct solution.\r\n\r\n That I am indeed Lionel Twain.\r\n\r\n You've all been so clever\r\n for so long...\r\n\r\n ...you've forgotten to be humble.\r\n\r\n You've tricked and fooled\r\n your readers for years.\r\n\r\n You've tortured us with\r\n surprise endings that made no sense.\r\n\r\n You've introduced characters at the\r\n end that weren't in the book before!\r\n\r\n You've withheld\r\n clues and information...\r\n\r\n ...that made it impossible for us\r\n to guess who did it.\r\n\r\n But now the tables are turned.\r\n\r\n Millions of angry mystery readers...\r\n\r\n ...are now getting their revenge.\r\n\r\n When the world learns\r\n I've outsmarted you...\r\n\r\n ...they'll be selling your $1 .95  books\r\n for 1 2 cents.\r\n\r\n It's checkout time,\r\nladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\n I have your bills ready.\r\n\r\n Credit cards will be accepted.\r\n\r\n -Even the scorpion was a fake?\r\n -Everything.  The bridge, the maid.\r\n\r\n -But you're sure about the scorpion?\r\n -Positive.\r\n\r\n Even the fog.  He made that with\r\n a dry ice machine.  See.\r\n\r\n How awfully unromantic.\r\n\r\n Then if he really\r\n was Lionel Twain...\r\n\r\n -...you must really be Sam Diamond.\r\n -That's right, baby.\r\n\r\n I was in disguise,\r\nin disguise, in disguise.\r\n\r\n You work hard for\r\n 50 bucks in this racket.\r\n\r\n I guess that means we won't\r\n see each other again.\r\n\r\n Well, that depends.\r\n I'll be around if you need me.\r\n\r\n All you gotta do is whistle.\r\n\r\n -You know how to whistle, don't you?\r\n -Certainly.  What do you mean?\r\n\r\n Never mind.  Forget it.\r\n You ruined it.\r\n\r\n I don't understand.\r\n Was there a murder or wasn't there?\r\n\r\n Yes.  Killed good weekend.\r\n\r\n Drive, please."
