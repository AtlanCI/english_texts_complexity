Elise tries to stop, but the woman pulls her along the road.\r\n 'To Lolinoz - now!'\r\n Elise remembers the name.\r\n 'The farm?'  she says.\r\n 'Of course, child,' says the woman.\r\n 'Where Stefan lives?'  asks Elise.\r\n 'Where we all live, Eloise,' says the woman.  ' I sometimes think you are stupid.'\r\n How does she know my name?  Or almost my name.\r\n There are white rocks between the trees above them, and large black birds on the rocks and in the trees.\r\n 'It's all right,\" Elise says, pulling her arm away from the woman.  She smiles.  'I'll come quietly.'\r\n 'Won't Stefan be surprised?'  she thinks.\r\n The road is narrow.  Soon the spring plants will grow and hide these rock faces.\r\n Suddenly the woman pushes Elise off the road and into the trees.  The sound of a car comes from the road in front of them.\r\n 'Don't move!'  says the woman.\r\n 'But -'\r\n 'Don't move!'\r\n It is an old car, from years ago.  It passes.  The woman waits, but does not explain.  Then she takes Elise back on to the road.\r\n She says, 'Now you understand?'\r\n Elise does not understand.  She is frightened.\r\n Elise remembers stories from the newspapers  —  stories of tourists murdered in the lonely French countryside.  A woman who went out on a bicycle, for example, and was never seen again.\r\n She remembers her father's words: 'Stay close to the village centre.  Always tell us where you're going.'\r\n 'Lolinoz, Dad!  Can you hear me?'\r\n 'Stay calm'\r\n 'I'm afraid I can't stay long.  I have to get back for lunch,' she says to the woman.\r\n The woman is not listening.  They are coming to some farm buildings.  The farmhouse is off the road, and is built of the same stone as the church.  They do not take the main path to the front of the farmhouse.  Trees hide the road. \r\n 'You've got animals, I think,' says Elise. ' I like animals.'  Her voice tells her that she is nervous.\r\n Suddenly, a high, windowless wall hides the sun.  It is cold in the shadows. \r\n 'Where are we going?'  she asks.\r\n No answer;  but the strong hand is back on Elises arm.  She is walking past a door in the wall but is pulled back.  The woman takes out a large key.\r\n 'In, child,' she says.\r\n 'I really think  — ' begins Elise.\r\n The door opens on to a dark room and wooden stairs.  There is an old smell of animals.  The woman locks the door from the inside.\r\n Elise moves back against the wall. \r\n 'I really must ask you to explain,' she says.\r\n The woman does not answer.  She pushes Elise up the stairs, but this time the touch is more friendly;  and there is almost a smile on the woman's face. \r\n 'Eloise, will you never accept the facts?'  asks the woman.\r\n 'Where are you taking me?'  Elise says.  ' I want to know.  You've made a mistake.  My name isn't Eloise.'\r\n 'You're making me angry, girl,' answers the woman.\r\n 'Really?'  says Elise.  'Well I'm glad.  Until you tell me -'\r\n The woman lifts her hand.  She is going to hit Elise across the face, but stops at the last second.  The speed of it, the danger of it, frightens Elise.\r\n 'Why fight?'  she thinks.  'I'll find out what's happening soon.'\r\n CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n The Children\r\n\r\n The stairs are long, and at the top the walls open into a roof space.  Sunlight from windows opposite the stairs leave everything in darkness.\r\n 'Now,' says the woman, 'you will explain to Sabina.'\r\n 'I'm not sure what -' Elise stops.  Now she can see the rest of the room.\r\n It is large, half in shadow, the top floor of a farm building.  I here are children, thirty of them or perhaps more than thirty.  Some are playing quietly; "

        "text":"The great texts of the ancient world don't survive to us in their original form.  They survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them.  And so it is with Archimedes, the great Greek mathematician. \r\n\r\n Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books, and they're called A, B and C.  And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.  And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.  Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906, and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the 19th of January, 1999.  And this is Codex C here. \r\n\r\n Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.  It's buried treasure.  Because this book is actually a prayer book.  It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the 14th of April, 1229.  And to make his prayer book he used parchment.  But he didn't use new parchment, he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts, and there were seven of them.  And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.  He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.  He erased all of their texts, and then he cut the sheets down in the middle, he shuffled them up, and he rotated them 90 degrees, and he wrote prayers on top of these books.  And essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book. \r\n\r\n The prayer book was discovered by this guy, Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.  And with just a magnifying glass, he transcribed as much of the text as he could.  And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts.  They weren't in A and B at all;  they were completely new texts by Archimedes, and they were called \"The Method\" and \"The Stomachion.\"  And it became a world famous manuscript. \r\n\r\n Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition.  It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it.  Forgeries were painted over it, and it suffered very badly from mold.  This book is the definition of a write-off.  It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution.  But it's not in an institution, it was bought by a private owner in 1998. \r\n\r\n Why did he buy this book?  Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.  He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.  He wanted to make that which was expensive free.  And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.  Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek, but they should have the chance to do it. \r\n\r\n So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes, and he promised to pay for all the work.  And it was an expensive job, but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think because these people, they didn't come from money, they came from Archimedes.  And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.  They came from particle physics, they came from classical philology, they came from book conservation, they came from ancient mathematics, they came from data management, they came from scientific imaging and program management.  And they got together to work on this manuscript. \r\n\r\n The first problem was a conservation problem.  And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with: There was glue on the spine of the book.  And if you look at this photograph carefully, the bottom half of this is rather brown.  And that glue is hide glue.  Now if you're a conservator, you can take off this glue reasonably easily.  The top half is Elmer's wood glue.  It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.  And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.  And so before we could start imaging Archimedes, we had to take this book apart.  So it took four years to take apart.  And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen. \r\n\r\n (Laughter) \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax, because this was used in the liturgical services of the Greek Orthodox Church and they'd used candle wax.  And the candle wax was dirty, and we couldn't image through the wax.  So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax. \r\n\r\n It's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is, but it came out in little bits very often.  And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits, but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.  So, tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place. \r\n\r\n Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.  And we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light.  Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light, you see different things.  And here is an image of a page imaged in 14 different wavebands of light. \r\n\r\n But none of them worked.  So what we did was we processed the images together, and we put two images into one blank screen.  And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.  And the image on the left is the normal red image.  And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.  And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.  If you merge them together into one digital canvas, the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright.  The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark.  The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.  And it'll come out dark but red, and then you can start to read it rather clearly.  And that's what it looks like. \r\n\r\n Now that's a before and after image, but you don't read the image on the screen like that.  You zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in, and you can just read it now. \r\n\r\n (Applause) \r\n\r\nIf you process the same two images in a different way, you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.  And this is terribly important, because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.  And there we are, I can give them to you. \r\n\r\n With this kind of imaging — this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging — we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.  How were we going to do that?  Well we took the manuscript, and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.  So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.  And that electron disappears.  And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place.  And when it takes its place, it sheds electromagnetic radiation.  It sheds an X-ray.  And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits. \r\n\r\n And what we wanted to get was the iron.  Because the ink was written in iron.  And if we can map where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from, we can map all the iron on the page, then theoretically we can read the image. \r\n\r\n The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.  So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California, which is a particle accelerator.  Electrons go around one way, positrons go around the other.  They meet in the middle, and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton.  Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.  But as the electrons go round at the speed of light, they shed X-rays.  And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.  This is called synchrotron radiation, and it's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing.  But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms, so that we could read the page from before and after.  And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.  It took about 17 minutes to do a single page. \r\n\r\n So what did we discover?  Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes is called \"The Stomachion.\"  And this didn't exist in Codices A and B. And we knew that it involved this square.  And this is a perfect square, and it's divided into 14 bits.  But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.  And now we think we know.  He was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits and still make a perfect square.  Anyone want to guess the answer?  It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.  And the important point about this is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.  And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics. \r\n\r\n The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made, the scribe had made his book out of, and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.  Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.  He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.  And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of Philip of Macedon.  So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.  This was a bad idea, because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great, and they lost the battle of Chaeronea. \r\n\r\n Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;  Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.  And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial — and it's a great speech: \"Best of all,\" he says, \"is to win.  But if you can't win, then you should fight for a noble cause, because then you'll be remembered.  Consider the Spartans.  They won enumerable victories, but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends.  The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of Thermopylae where they were butchered to a man, but fought for the freedom of Greece.\"  It was such a great speech that the Athenian law courts let him off.  He lived for another 10 years, then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.  They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory, and no one knows what they did with his body.  So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity, speaking to us, not from the grave, because his grave doesn't exist, but from the Athenian law courts. \r\n\r\n Now I should say at this point that normally when you're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off, you don't find unique texts.  And to find two in one manuscript is really something.  To find three is completely weird.  And we found three. \r\n\r\n Aristotle's \"Categories\" is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy. "

Even so, there were rivulets of sweat trickling down his face and back and under his arms.\r\n\r\n It was fear.  The hot pressure of his anus.  The adrenalin squirting into his stomach.  He wanted desperately to turn and go back, and because of that, he urged himself to go farther on.  God in heaven, if he missed this chance at the kid, it wasn't going to be because he was afraid to die.  Jesus no.  He owed that to Orval.  He owed it to the rest of them.\r\n\r\n Seven-fifteen.  He had crawled far out now, and he had worked back and forth across the forest, pausing, peering deeply into groves and thickets to see if the kid was hiding there.  Small noises made him jumpy, noises he could not account for, the snap of a branch that could be the kid adjusting his position to aim, the brush of leaves that could be the kid circling behind him.  He crawled slowly, fighting his panic to speed up and get this over, fighting to concentrate on everything around him.  The slightest piece of cover was all the kid needed.  All he himself had to do was get careless once and not check one bush or one stump or one dip in the ground, and that might be the end.  It would be so abrupt that he would never hear the burst of the shot that killed him.\r\n\r\n Then it was seven-thirty and the shadows had merged deep enough to trick him.  What looked like the kid was only the dark trunk of a crooked tree set far back in the gloom.  A fallen log in back of a bush deceived him the same way, and he knew he had done the best he could.  It was time to head back.  That was the worst part.  His eyes were tired and the shadows were touching him, and he just wanted to hurry back to Shingleton and relax a minute and let Shingleton keep watch for the kid.  But he could not dare give up searching to speed up back there.  Even as he returned, he still had to take his time and check every bush and tree before he made a move.  He had to look behind, afraid the kid was sneaking toward him.  His back felt so naked, so white in the gloom that he kept expecting to glance around and see the kid aiming with a smile at the cleft between his shoulder blades.  The bullet would blast apart his backbone and rupture his insides and instantly he would be dead.  In spite of himself he hurried to return.\r\n\r\n He almost forgot to let Shingleton know it was himself coming.  Wouldn't that be a laugh.  To risk searching for the kid and then be shot by his own man.  'It's me,' he whispered.  'It's Teasle.'\r\n\r\n But nobody answered.\r\n\r\n I whispered too low and he didn't hear me, Teasle thought.  'It's me,' he repeated, louder.  'It's Teasle.'  But again nobody answered, and Teasle knew something had to be wrong.\r\n\r\n He circled the hollow and crept up from behind, and something was more than wrong.  Shingleton wasn't there, and Mitch was flat on his back in the water, his throat neatly slit from ear to ear, his blood steaming in the cold.  Shingleton.  Where was Shingleton?  Worried and tired of waiting, he must have gone after the kid too, and left Mitch and the kid came up and slit his throat to kill him quietly.  The kid, Teasle realized, the kid must be very close.  He crouched and spun, and the sight of Mitch, the frenzy of trying to protect himself from all angles made him want to cry out, Shingleton, get back here, Shingleton!  Two men facing in opposite directions would maybe see the kid before he rushed them.  Shingleton, he wanted to call.\r\n\r\n"

He did this because he understands data as well as books.  Now the thing to do with books, if you want to ensure their long-term utility, is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them.  The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive, is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible.  And that's what he did. \r\n\r\n And institutions can learn from this.  Because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.  And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web, at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site or the University Library of X's site, which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data.  What you want to do is to aggregate it all together. \r\n\r\n Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions.  It's going to be built by users, by people who get this data together, by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from, all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from, people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things.  And that is the future of the Web.  And it's an attractive and beautiful future, if only we can make it happen. \r\n\r\n Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example, and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web for people to enjoy — all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.  under a Creative Commons license.  Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts, but the data is fantastic.  And the result of this is that if you do a Google search on images right now and you type in \"Illuminated manuscript Koran\" for example, 24 of the 28 images you'll find come from my institution. \r\n\r\n (Applause) \r\n\r\nNow, let's think about this for a minute.  What's in it for the institution?  There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.  You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing, but let's talk about selfish things.  Because what's really in it for the institution is this: Now why do people go to the Louvre?  They go to see the Mona Lisa.  Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa?  Because they already know what she looks like.  And they know what she looks like because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere. \r\n\r\n Now, there is no need for these restrictions at all.  And I think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses, and it would be a great benefit to everybody.  Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the Internet. \r\n\r\n Thank you very much indeed. \r\n\r\n (Applause)"

        "text":"When I was a little child I thought the police are particular race whose makes a boring world more interesting.\r\n\r\n The people made the jokes about the police.  I thought the police is a man whose IQ is under 80 (the average is about one hundred).\r\n We can see two policeman walking in the street because the first of them knows to learn, the second knows to write.  They help each other.\r\n When the dog walks with policemen it is the most intelligent part of the team.  If we say „sit down\"-the dog sits but the policeman stand up. .  I was about twelve and I saw the films in the TV about police work I changed my opinion.  In these films the policemen were heroic.  They are chasing criminals in fast cars with flashing lights and wailing sirens.  They save the lives of innocent people.  I think it was a part of children life when I and many my boyfriends were impressed by it and we wanted became a police.\r\n\r\n I grew up and I know the policeman is in danger every day and risks his life day by day.  But maybe it is true that some of policemen is feeble-minded e.g.  I don’t know why the police bought lighter to his only three years old child ( in our shop ) or when he stopped the car and controls the lights, direction indicator he says: „ It’s good, It’s wrong, It’s good, It’s wrong\".\r\n The Police in own country is more backward then in any states.  They have a special cars with marks: P o l í c i a.  The policemen have some weapons : truncheon, handcuffs and some of them have gun and radio, too.  Some teams of policemen are helped by the special trained dogs.  Sniffer dogs are used by police and custom officers all over the world to detect drugs and explosives.  Dogs have far better sense of smell than people because the smell receptors at the top of a dog’s nose are 100 times longer than in humans.\r\n Training for a sniffer dogs lasts 12 weeks.  They are trained in two stages.  First, the trainer teaches the dog to recognise a particular drug or explosive.  He hides a sample of the drug or explosive or a rag, which is called a training aid.  He places it where the dog can see it and tells the dog to bring the aid back.  When it does so, he gives the dog a reward - usually a friendly fight with the trainer or a bone.  The dog soon learns to recognise the substance by it’s smell.  The type of training aid is changed regularly but the smell always remains the same.  In the second stage, the aid is hidden where the dog cannot see it.\r\n\r\n Smells such us perfumes, which some smugglers use to hide the smell of the drugs, are also used so that the dog becomes familiar with them.\r\n Sniffer dogs are trained to detect 12 different types of explosives and four different types of drugs.\r\n Policemen in our country are known by their dressing: green trousers, green blouse, green jacket and green cap.  One part of Police is a Town Police.  They haven’t the same uniform because the dominant colour is black instead of green.\r\n The policemen in Britain are called constables or bobbies.  They have a tall black cap and their uniform is black, too.  Sometimes we can see in England ride on horse.  It has long tradition in Britain.\r\n\r\n We can say the work of Police is hard because they must do night shift, too.  After it the policeman try to catch up on lost sleep, but we known it’s hard to sleep during the day.\r\n It’s a sad fact that the criminal is grows up and the people afraid.  They are frightened of violence and therefore the people are carrying the weapons : knives, coshes and so on.  The result of police work aren’t satisfactory.  I think their work would be better ( more criminals in prison, finding a drugs, less violence...) if they haven’t financial and material problems (they haven’t to buy petrol).\r\n The solution of these problems belongs to department of government in every states.\r\n The little true story from the life:\r\n\r\nOne evening Mr. Green was driving his car along a country road.  He had been to London where he took L 50 from the bank.  He put the money into his pocket.\r\n At some part of the road a man in shabby clothes atopped him and asked for a lift.  Mr. Green told him to get into the car and continued on his way home.  He talked to the man and learned thet the man had escaped from prison only two days earlier.  Mr. Green was worried at the thought that he had his L 50.  Suddenly he saw a police-car and had a bright idea.  He began to drive the car as fast as it would go.  He looked back and saw the police-car nearing his car.  It soon overtook him and he had to stop.  The policeman got out of his car, took out a notebook and wanted Mr. Green’s name and address.  Mr. Greens wanted to tell the policeman about the robber sitting behind but the man had taken out a gun and had put it to Mr. Green’s back.  Mr. Greens was afraid of being shot so he said nothing.  He only asked to be taken to the police station but the policeman said: „You’ll have to appear at the police court later.\"  He gave Mr. Green a talk about dangerous driving and went away.\r\n\r\n Then Mr. Green started up his car again and drive on.  He thought his L 50 were lost.  When they were near a small town the robber said that he wanted to get out.  He said to Mr. Green: „Thanks for the lift.  You have been good to me.  This is the least I can do in return.\"  And he handed Mr. Green the policeman’s notebook.  ."

        "text":"Instead Shingleton called to him from some place on the right.  'Look out, Will, he's got me!'  His cry was punctuated by a rifle shot, and that was all Teasle could stand.  He finally had his breakdown, running before he knew it, screaming, racing away, charging through the shadows, through the trees and bushes.  Aaaeeiii, he was screaming.  The niche in the cliff, was all he could think.  The cliff the cliff!\r\n\r\n 14\r\n\r\n He shot at Teasle, but the light was bad and the trees were too thick, and anyway, Shingleton grabbed the rifle so that the bullet jerked low.  Shingleton ought to have been dead.  He had been shot in the skull.  He should not have been able to get back off the ground and grab the rifle to throw off its aim.  Rambo really had to admire him as he shot him again, through one eye now, and this time Shingleton was dead for sure.\r\n\r\n Without a pause he set off running after Teasle.  It was obvious that Teasle's direction was back toward the niche in the cliff, and he planned on beating him there.  He did not follow exactly on Teasle's path  —  Teasle might get control of himself and lie somewhere waiting  —  so he ran in a line parallel to Teasle, racing to beat him to the cliff.\r\n\r\n He just missed him.  He came hurrying through the woods, able to see the cliff edge now and the top of the niche, and he dropped to his knees, hiding for Teasle.  But then he heard chips of stone rattling down the cliff and the sound of heavy breathing down there, and he rushed over just in time to see Teasle jump the last few feet down the niche, ducking around the side of the cliff wall.  He saw too the bodies of the four deputies where he had shot them at the bottom of the cliff, and he didn't like the position he was in.  Now Teasle had the advantage.  To climb down the niche after him, he would be as easy a target for Teasle as the four deputies had been for himself.\r\n\r\n He knew damn well that Teasle was not going to stand down there all night waiting for him.  Shortly Teasle was going to take his chance and clear out, and he would be left up on top, suspecting that Teasle was gone but not willing to risk that he was still there.  To be safe he had to find another way down off this bluff, and that way had to be in the direction Teasle would take for home.\r\n\r\n He raced back toward where he had killed Shingleton, and passed his body, and continued racing toward where he hoped the bluff would slope down into the draw, and it did slope down, and in half an hour he was into the draw, running through the woods toward a stretch of grass he had dimly spotted from above.  The light was fading worse, and he was hurrying to get to the grass before the dark could blot out Teasle's trail.  He reached the grass and ran through the line of trees that bordered it, not wanting to show himself as a target while he searched for tracks that led out of the trees into the open space.  He looked and ran to look farther along, but still no tracks in the wet earth, and he thought that maybe Teasle had been slow to leave the cliff, began to worry that Teasle was behind him, coming, watching.  Just as it started to rain again and made everything even darker, he found the grass pushed down.\r\n\r\n There.\r\n\r\n But he had to take a handicap, give Teasle a headstart.\r\n\r\n Because in spite of his temptation to rush across the open grass after him, he had to wait until the night was fully black: Teasle might not be running ahead at all, he might be lying in the bushes on the other side, aiming.  Then he supposed it dark enough so he could run across without showing himself as a target, but his caution was needless because when he got over there Teasle was not around.  The rain was falling lightly through the trees, it muffled sounds very little, and there, up ahead, something was working to break through the thick underbrush.\r\n\r\n He set out after it, stopped and listened, corrected his direction toward the noise, then set on again.  He expected that fairly soon Teasle would give up running and try to ambush him, but as long as he could hear Teasle running, it was safe to keep after him and make all the noise he had to.  Then one time he stopped and listened, and the running up ahead was stopped as well, so he sank to the ground and began crawling quietly forward.  In a minute the running up ahead continued again, and he leapt to his feet, charging after it.  That was the pattern for an hour: running, stopping, listening, crawling, running.  The rain kept on in a cold faint drizzle, and the belt that was cinched around his ribs loosened, and he had to tighten it to ease the pain.  He was certain now that his ribs were broken and that sharp bones were lancing his insides.  He would have given up, but he knew he would have Teasle soon;  he doubled over in agony, but Teasle was still running up there, so he straightened, pushing himself on.\r\n\r\n The chase went up a slope of trees, over a spine of rock and down a patch of shale to a stream, then along the bank of the stream, across the stream into more woods, across a ravine.  The pain in his chest cut sharply as he jumped across, and he almost slipped down into the ravine, but he pulled himself up, listened for Teasle, heard him and chased after him.  Each time his right foot hit the ground, the jolt went all the way up his right side, grating his ribs.  Twice he was sick.\r\n\r\n 15\r\n\r\n Up and down, the pattern of the country repeated itself.  Stumbling up a slope of rocks and brush, Teasle felt like he was back on the ledge, trying to get up the rise to the woods.  In the dark he couldn't see the top;  he wished he knew how far it was;  he couldn't keep on climbing much longer.  The rain was making the rocks slippery, and he was losing his balance, falling hard.  He took to crawling up, and the rocks tore at his pants, cut into his knees, while behind him, down in the trees at the bottom, he heard the kid breaking through the undergrowth.\r\n\r\n He scrambled faster.  If he could just see the top and know how far he had to go.  The kid must be out of the woods now and starting up the slope, and Teasle thought of shooting blindly down to hold him back.  He couldn't: the flashes from his pistol would give the kid a target, but Christ, he had to do something.\r\n\r\n In one desperate lunge he reached the top but didn't know it was the top until he tripped and barely grabbed a rock in time to stop from rolling down the other side.  Now.  Now he could shoot.  He stretched out and listened to where the kid was rushing up the slope, and he fired six times in a line across the noises.  Then he hugged the ground in case he had missed, and a shot came from below, zinging over him.  He heard the kid climbing off to the left, and he fired once more at the noise before he started racing down the other side of the slope.  Again he tripped, and now he struck his shoulder solidly against a rock and couldn't keep from rolling as he grabbed his shoulder and tumbled to the bottom.\r\n\r\n He lay there dazed.  The wind was knocked out of him, and he fought to breathe but he couldn't.  He gasped and pushed his stomach muscles in, but they wanted to push out, and then he managed to suck in a little air and a little more, and he was almost breathing normally again when he heard the kid clambering on the rocks above.  He groped to his knees, then to his feet  —  and discovered that in his fall he had lost hold of his pistol.  It was somewhere up on the slope.  No time to go back for it.  No light to find it.\r\n\r\n He staggered through woods, circling he guessed, going nowhere, winding around and around until he'd be brought to bay.  Already his knees were buckling.  His direction was wobbly.  He was bumping against trees, a crazy vision in his head of him in his office, bare feet on the desk, head tilted sipping hot soup.  Tomato soup.  No, bean with bacon.  The rich expensive kind where the label said don't add water.\r\n\r\n 16\r\n\r\n It was only minutes now before he'd have him.  The noises ahead were slowing, more erratic, clumsy.  He could hear Teasle breathing hoarsely, he was that close to him.  Teasle had given him a good race, that was sure.  He had figured to tag him several miles ago, and here they were still at it.  But not for long.  A few minutes now.  That was all.\r\n\r\n The pain in his ribs, he had to slow, but it was still a fair pace, and since Teasle had slowed too, he wasn't bothered much.  His hand was over his ribs, helping the belt to press.  All his right side was swollen.  In the rain the belt was even looser than before, and he had to keep his hand pressing.\r\n\r\n Then he stumbled and fell.  He hadn't done that before.  No, he was wrong about that.  He had stumbled at the ravine.  Then he stumbled again, and rising to his feet, working on, he decided it might take slightly more than a few minutes before he caught up to Teasle.  It would be soon, though.  No question about it.  Just a little more than a few minutes.  That was all.\r\n\r\n Had he said that out loud?\r\n\r\n The brambles caught him full in the face as he came up to them in the dark.  They were spikes lashing into him, and he recoiled, clutching his ripped cheeks.  He knew it wasn't rain wetting his cheeks and hands.  But it did not matter, because off in there in the brambles was the sound of Teasle crawling.  This was it.  He had him.  He bore to the left along the edge of the brambles, waiting for it to curve down and lead him to the bottom of the patch where he could rest and wait for Teasle to crawl out.  In the dark he would not be able to see the surprised look on Teasle's face when he shot him.\r\n\r\n But the longer he hurried along the edge of the brambles, the farther it stretched on, and he began to wonder if the brambles covered all this section of the slope.  He hurried farther, and still the brambles did not curve down, and then he was sure they stretched all along this rise.  He wanted to stop and double back, but he had the thought that if he kept on just a little more, the brambles would at last curve down.  Five minutes became what he judged was fifteen, and then twenty, and he was wasting his time, he should have gone right in after Teasle, but now he could not.  In the dark he had no idea where Teasle had entered.\r\n\r\n Double back.  Maybe the brambles did not go far along the other end of this ridge, maybe they curved down over there.  He rushed back, holding his side, moaning.  He hurried a long while until he no longer believed they would ever curve down, and when next he stumbled and fell, he remained face down in the muddy grass.\r\n\r\n He'd lost him.  He had given up so much time and strength to come so close and lose him.  His face stung from the gashes of the brambles.  His ribs were on fire, his hands pulpy, his clothes ripped, his body slashed.  And he had lost him, the rain coming down in a gently cooling drizzle as he lay there splayed out, breathing deeply…holding it, letting it out slowly, breathing deeply again, letting the dead weight of his arms and legs relax with every slow exhale  —  for the first time he could remember, crying, softly crying.\r\n\r\n 17\r\n\r\n Any moment the kid would be breaking through the brambles after him.  He crawled hysterically.  Then the brambles got lower and thicker until he had to press himself flat and wriggle.  Even so, the lowest branches scraped across his back and snagged in the seat of his pants, and when he twisted to unsnag them, other branches gouged his arms and shoulders.  He's coming, he thought, and squirmed desperately forward, letting the barbs dig into him.  His belt buckle scooped into the mud, funneling it into his pants.\r\n\r\n But where was he going?  How did he know he wasn't completing a circle, returning to the kid?  He stopped, frightened.  The land sloped down.  He must be on the side of a hill.  If he kept wriggling downward, he'd be headed straight away.  Or would he?  Hard to think, suffocated in the dense black tangle and the constant rain.  You bastard kid, I'm going to get away and kill you for this.\r\n\r\n Kill you for this.\r\n\r\n He lifted his head off the mud.  And couldn't recall having moved for a while.  And gradually understood he had passed out.  He stiffened and glanced all around.  The kid could have crept up to him his stupor and slit his throat just like he did to Mitch.  Christ, he said out loud, and his voice was a croak that startled him.  Christ, he said again  —  to free his voice  —  but the word broke like a crust of ice.\r\n\r\n No, I'm wrong, he thought, his brain slowly unclouding.  The kid wouldn't have crept up in my sleep to kill me.  He would have wakened me first.  He'd want me to know what was happening.\r\n\r\n So where is he?  Watching close?  Finding my trail, coming?  He listened for noises in the brush and didn't hear anything and had to keep moving, had to keep distance between them.\r\n\r\n But when he tried crawling fast, he only managed a sluggish strain to pull forward.  He must have been unconscious a long time back there.  The light wasn't black now, it was gray, and he could see the brambles everywhere, thick and ugly, spines an inch long.  He fingered his back, and he was like a porcupine, dozens of barbs hooked in his skin.  He stared at his hand all bloody and struggled worming on.  Maybe the kid was very close, watching him, enjoying him suffer.\r\n\r\n Then it all confused, and then the sun was up, and through the tops of the brambles, he saw the sky bright and stark blue.  He laughed.  What are you laughing at?\r\n\r\n Laughing at?  I don't even remember the rain stopping, and now the sky is clear and it's daylight for crissake.  He laughed again and realized he was turning giddy.  And that was funny and he laughed at that.  He had crawled ten feet out of the brambles into an autumn-plowed field before he understood that he was out.  It was quite a joke.  He squinted and tried to see the end of the field and couldn't, and tried standing and couldn't, and the inside of his head was spinning so much that he had to laugh again.  Then he suddenly quit.  The kid would be around here somewhere aiming.  He'd enjoy watching me come out sliced to pieces before he shot.  The sonofabitch I'll… Bean with bacon soup.\r\n\r\n His stomach heaved up.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Sport is very important part of life in Great Britain.  Thousands of people devote their leisure time to outdoor and indoor games: athletic, mountain climbing, boxing and other sports.  Outdoor games played in GB are team games such as football, cricket, and hockey, and games in which individuals or couples try their skill, for example golf.  The number of spectators shows that the most popular of the team game is football and cricket, and the most popular individual game is lawn-tennis.  Football.  Although Englishmen played a kind of football from the middle age or even earlier as an organized game it dates back from just over a century ago.  One type of football, in which the players carried the oval ball in their hands, appeared in 1859 at Rugby School.  That is why the name took the name of Rugby.  The rules of the game are different from football(soccer).  Football matches get big crowds.  The Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year in England;  it is always played at the Wembley stadium, near London.  Cricket.  Cricket is England's national summer game.  Nobody knows exactly how old the game is, but some forms of cricket was being played in England in the 13th century.  The rules of the game have changed over the years.  The oldest series of international matches is between England and Australia, and the team that wins takes home a famous trophy called The Ashes.  And even today for cricket lovers in England and Australia winning The Ashes is like winning The World Cup for football!  In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all towns have their cricket team which play regularly at least one match a weak during the season - from May to September.  There are thousands of cricket grounds all over England.  Lawn-tennis.  The number of people who play lawn-tennis is great.  The tennis championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end of June and at the beginning of July are the main event of the lawn-tennis season in Britain and, in fact in the world.  These championships in which men and women of many nationalities complete, gather large crowds.  Swimming.  Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during the holidays at the seaside, and swimming pool as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.  There are also indoor swimming pools which makes swimming possible all the year round.  Swimming championships and competitions are widely reported in press and on TV.  Attempts to swim the English channel have been made by swimmers of many nationalities every summer.  Some of the attempts are successful."

        "text":"A NEWLY glimpsed boson is prompting celebration around the world, but the particle could yet break the model that it is credited with completing.  Or so most physicists hope.\r\n\r\n Although spotted at last, many properties of the new particle - thought to be the Higgs boson, or at least something similar - have yet to be tested.  What's more, the telltale signature it left in the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) does not exactly match what is predicted by the standard model of particle physics, the leading explanation for the known particles and the forces that act on them.  So it is possible the new particle is something much more exotic, such as a member of a more complete model of the universe that includes the mysterious entities of dark matter and gravity.  That would end the standard model's supremacy, but it would also be a cause for even greater celebration than the discovery of the Higgs itself.\r\n\r\n \"Many of my colleagues and I think that this discovery on Wednesday may mark the beginning of the end of the standard model,\" says Georg Weiglein of the German Electron Synchotron research centre (DESY) in Hamburg.  \"Maybe these little deviations from the standard model really build up to a significant deviation.  Maybe once we make this more precise with more data we will see that this is not the standard-model Higgs.\"\r\n\r\n Rapturous applause, whistles and cheers filled the auditorium at CERN, near Geneva, Switzerland, as the heads of the twin LHC experiments presented their particle discoveries on 4 July.  Joe Incandela of CMS and Fabiola Gianotti of ATLAS both reported seeing excesses of particles that fit the profile of a Higgs, with masses of 125 and 126 gigaelectronvolts (GeV) respectively.  (In particle physics energy and mass are interchangeable.)\r\n\r\n The Higgs doesn't just complete the standard model, it also has a key role to play in the nature of matter itself, as the fundamental component of the Higgs field.  According to the standard model, all particles must pass through this omnipresent entity.  Some, like the photon, slip through unhindered - they are massless.  Others are slowed down, resulting in mass.  \"This boson is a very profound thing,\" says Incandela.  \"It embodies substance to all these other particles that exist.\"\r\n\r\n Given the rumours, leaks and hype leading up to the announcement - and the knowledge that a discovery was in principle possible given the data collected - the particle discovery was not a complete surprise.  Remarkably though, ATLAS and CMS both claimed 5 sigma confidence in the result, equivalent to a 5 in 10 million chance that the readings could have been created by background processes in the detector.  That exceeded the best of the anticipated outcomes.  \"I think we have it,\" concluded Rolf-Dieter Heuer, director general of CERN.\r\n\r\n Discussion quickly moved to what exactly \"it\" was.  The Higgs hasn't been glimpsed directly - but via its decay into a plethora of other particles more easily picked up by the LHC detectors.\r\n\r\n The standard model predicts the rate at which a Higgs of a given mass should decay into these particles.  But the reported rates for the new particle do not exactly match what is predicted for a mass of about 125 GeV (see diagram).  The anomalies could disappear, producing a standard-model Higgs - or they could grow.  Most physicists are hoping for the latter.\r\n\r\n It is clear that the standard model is inadequate, not least because it can't explain 80 per cent of the matter in our galaxy - dark matter - and makes no mention of gravity (See \"Can we split the Higgs boson?\") .  A non-standard-model Higgs would be a big clue as to which of many proposed extensions to the standard model - if any - is a correct description of reality.\r\n\r\n Steven Weinberg, who won a Nobel prize in 1979 for theoretical work on elementary particles, has previously said it would be a \"nightmare\" if a Higgs boson was discovered that neatly fulfilled its duties as laid out by the standard model and did nothing more.  Such a particle wouldn't give us clues about what's next.  \"It is crucial to keep looking for clues to a more comprehensive theory,\" he told New Scientist following the announcement.\r\n\r\n Luckily, there are several gaps in the data presented last week that might yet turn the nightmare into a dream.  Conversations with physicists from ATLAS and CMS at the International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP), which kicked off in Melbourne, Australia, directly after the CERN announcement, and the flurry of papers appearing on the arxiv preprint server since the announcement, suggest that there are grounds for cautious optimism.\r\n\r\n According to the standard model, a Higgs boson of about 125 GeV should decay into tau particles about six per cent of the time, but it seems to be doing it a lot less than that.  At last week's seminar, the CMS team reported no excess in tau production beyond what is expected due to background processes.  ATLAS, meanwhile, did not release any data specifically on tau production.  \"I think this is a very intriguing thing, which is perhaps trying to tell us something already,\" says Albert De Roeck of CMS.  \"It's sort of a really strange game that's going on there,\" agrees Paul Jackson of ATLAS.  \"If that continues to be seen, it is certainly not a Higgs boson.\"\r\n\r\n What else would it be?  Only two types of elementary particle are known to exist: fermions, which make up matter and include electrons, quarks and neutrinos;  and bosons, which are force carriers and include photons and the W and Z bosons.  According to the standard model, the Higgs field is responsible for the mass of all the fermions and bosons.  But taus are fermions - and if the Higgs is not decaying into taus, it is probably not giving them mass either.  Might the Higgs only give mass to bosons?\r\n\r\n De Roeck thinks that might be the case.  He points out that when Peter Higgs and others came up with the theory in the 1960s, the Higgs mechanism was designed only to explain the mass of the bosons.  It wasn't until later that the mechanism was extended to include all other mass-bearing particles, as a simplification, he says.  \"So maybe the Higgs is doing what it should be doing.\"\r\n\r\n That's interesting, because then something else is needed to give mass to fermions, a possibility that starts to sound a lot like a hypothetical but mathematically elegant extension to the standard model called supersymmetry.  This theory proposes a slew of new particles and superpartners to solve several phenomena that the standard model can't address, including dark matter and a thorny contradiction known as the hierarchy problem.  Supersymmetry specifies a minimum of five Higgs bosons, plus several superpartner Higgsinos - some of these other Higgses could give fermions mass if it turns out that the boson spotted at the LHC doesn't.\r\n\r\n See graphic: \"New particle, new questions\"\r\n\r\n Many are cautious about extrapolating so much from the tau data at such an early stage.  Peter Jenni, a founder and former head of ATLAS, doesn't think it is telling us anything yet.  He says bigger statistical deviations have disappeared in the past and he expects this one to as well.\r\n\r\n But just about everyone agrees that it's a channel to keep an eye on.  \"It's not something we're yet making any strong statements about, but it will be something interesting to watch,\" Incandela said at ICHEP.\r\n\r\n Decay data\r\n\r\n The low tau rate wasn't the only anomaly in the data.  The CMS and ATLAS teams also reported that the new boson seems to decay into a pair of photons too frequently - about one-and-a-half times the rate predicted by the standard model (see diagram).  If that trend continues, it could mean that another particle is being produced in the detectors, alongside the Higgs-like boson.  That particle might be one of the other Higgs particles predicted by supersymmetry, says De Roeck, or something else.\r\n\r\n This \"diphoton\" excess is extremely important, says Kai Wang of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.  \"If the current situation stays and the precision improves, I believe it will strongly imply the existence of physics beyond the standard model.\"\r\n\r\n Two days after the announcement, Wang's team posted a paper on arxiv showing that the existence of superpartners of tau particles - called \"staus\" - could explain the diphoton excess.  They show that, via a mechanism first outlined by a group based at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, these particles could cause the Higgs to produce more photons (arxiv.org/abs/1207.0990).\r\n\r\n It won't be smooth sailing for the LHC experimenters, says Wang.  The types of collision that occur at the LHC make creating stau particles difficult.  Another kind of collider might be needed (see \"Physicists propose factory to spew out Higgs particles\").\r\n\r\n Another intriguing explanation - which could account for the tau deficit and the photon excess - appeared on arxiv on 5 July.  Dan Hooper and Matthew Buckley, both of Fermilab, calculate that if the superpartner of the top quark - the stop - is present when the Higgs is decaying, it will alter the decay to create both anomalies (arxiv.org/abs/1207.1445).  By contrast, a stau only explains the excess of photons.  \"If you only want to introduce one new particle, stops are the only one that gets you everything you need to explain the data,\" Hooper says.\r\n\r\n See graphic: \"A boson spotter's guide\"\r\n\r\n A stau or a stop would be good news for finding dark matter.  \"In either of these scenarios, you expect at least one superpartner that's even lighter than the stau or stop,\" says Hooper.  \"That could be the dark matter.\"\r\n\r\n Exciting though these possibilities are, nearly everyone urges caution.  \"All of these things, they're like pipe dreams,\" says Christoph Paus of CMS.  \"Of course I'd like to see a difference, but if I'm honest, at the moment everything looks like the standard-model Higgs.\"  Even if both anomalies disappear, the Higgs needn't leave us in Weinberg's nightmare.\r\n\r\n Although ATLAS and CMS had enough data to see the new boson with certainty, they haven't yet got enough to pin down its properties.  They now need to identify the particle's spin - a quantum property a bit like the angle of a particle's rotational axis.\r\n\r\n The observed decay into photon pairs, combined with the fact that the particle is definitely a boson, constrain its spin to either 2 or 0.  To fulfil its duty of giving other particles mass via the Higgs mechanism, the spin must be 0.  Only then can the particle be the fundamental component of the non-directional, or \"scalar\", Higgs field.\r\n\r\n Most physicists think it will be 0, because producing a particle with a spin of 2 in a collider is harder and so less likely.  However, even if it is 0 there's yet another way it may still be non-standard, which relates to a property called parity, most easily explained via mirror images.  Usually, if a particle has spin 0, its mirror image looks identical.  But it is possible for a particle to be spin 0 and not have that property.  Among the five Higgses in supersymmetry, one - known as a pseudoscalar - has this property.\r\n\r\n \"Finding something, and it being a pseudoscalar, is right up the alley of supersymmetry,\" says De Roeck.  Although he adds that, maddeningly, if it isn't a pseudoscalar, that doesn't mean supersymmetry is ruled out.\r\n\r\n Jenni, meanwhile, bristles at the notion of a nightmare scenario, and says that finding a standard-model Higgs would be just fine.  \"To find this last piece of the puzzle was one of the main goals of the LHC.  We also know that the standard model does not explain it all, so I don't think this will mean that life for the next 15 years at the LHC will be boring at all.\"\r\n\r\n Until next year, when it will hibernate for an upgrade, the LHC is expected to run smoothly, more than doubling the total amount of data collected.  By some estimates, that could allow the tau, diphoton and spin questions to be settled within a year.\r\n\r\n That's good news for those of us waiting on tenterhooks to find out if we are living in a supersymmetric universe, or something even more weird and wonderful.  But it's a mixed bag for those already tired after the scramble to produce the Higgs result in time for ICHEP.  \"Now all hell breaks loose,\" says De Roeck.  \"I was thinking about taking a vacation.  But now...\""

        "text":"Between October and June they shuffle out of auditoriums, gymnasiums and classrooms, their eyes adjusting to the sunlight as their fingers fumble to awaken cell phones that have been silent for four consecutive hours.  Some raise a hand to their foreheads, as though trying to rub away a headache.  Others linger in front of the parking lot, unsure of what to do next.  They are absolutely exhausted, but not because of any strenuous physical activity.  Rather, these high school students have just taken the SAT.  \"I was fast asleep as soon as I got home,\" Ikra Ahmad told The Local, a New York Times blog, when she was interviewed for a story on \"SAT hangover.\"\r\n\r\n Temporary mental exhaustion is a genuine and common phenomenon, which, it is important to note, differs from chronic mental fatigue associated with regular sleep deprivation and some medical disorders.  Everyday mental weariness makes sense, intuitively.  Surely complex thought and intense concentration require more energy than routine mental processes.  Just as vigorous exercise tires our bodies, intellectual exertion should drain the brain.  What the latest science reveals, however, is that the popular notion of mental exhaustion is too simplistic.  The brain continuously slurps up huge amounts of energy for an organ of its size, regardless of whether we are tackling integral calculus or clicking through the week's top 10 LOLcats.  Although firing neurons summon extra blood, oxygen and glucose, any local increases in energy consumption are tiny compared with the brain's gluttonous baseline intake.  So, in most cases, short periods of additional mental effort require a little more brainpower than usual, but not much more.  Most laboratory experiments, however, have not subjected volunteers to several hours' worth of challenging mental acrobatics.  And something must explain the feeling of mental exhaustion, even if its physiology differs from physical fatigue.  Simply believing that our brains have expended a lot of effort might be enough to make us lethargic.\r\n\r\n Brainpower\r\n Although the average adult human brain weighs about 1.4 kilograms, only 2 percent of total body weight, it demands 20 percent of our resting metabolic rate (RMR) — the total amount of energy our bodies expend in one very lazy day of no activity.  RMR varies from person to person depending on age, gender, size and health.  If we assume an average resting metabolic rate of 1,300 calories, then the brain consumes 260 of those calories just to keep things in order.  That's 10.8 calories every hour or 0.18 calories each minute.  (For comparison's sake, see Harvard's table of calories burned during different activities).  With a little math, we can convert that number into a measure of power:\r\n\r\n — Resting metabolic rate: 1300 kilocalories, or kcal, the kind used in nutrition\r\n — 1,300 kcal over 24 hours = 54.16  kcal per hour = 15.04 gram calories per second\r\n — 15.04 gram calories/sec = 62.93 joules/sec = about 63 watts\r\n — 20 percent of 63 watts = 12.6 watts\r\n\r\n So a typical adult human brain runs on around 12 watts — a fifth of the power required by a standard 60 watt lightbulb.  Compared with most other organs, the brain is greedy;  pitted against man-made electronics, it is astoundingly efficient.  IBM's Watson, the supercomputer that defeated Jeopardy!  champions, depends on ninety IBM Power 750 servers, each of which requires around one thousand watts.\r\n\r\n Energy travels to the brain via blood vessels in the form of glucose, which is transported across the blood-brain barrier and used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main currency of chemical energy within cells.  Experiments with both animals and people have confirmed that when neurons in a particular brain region fire, local capillaries dilate to deliver more blood than usual, along with extra glucose and oxygen.  This consistent response makes neuroimaging studies possible: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) depends on the unique magnetic properties of blood flowing to and from firing neurons.  Research has also confirmed that once dilated blood vessels deliver extra glucose, brain cells lap it up.\r\n\r\n Extending the logic of such findings, some scientists have proposed the following: if firing neurons require extra glucose, then especially challenging mental tasks should decrease glucose levels in the blood and, likewise, eating foods rich in sugars should improve performance on such tasks.  Although quite a few studies have confirmed these predictions, the evidence as a whole is mixed and most of the changes in glucose levels range from the miniscule to the small.  In a study at Northumbria University, for example, volunteers that completed a series of verbal and numerical tasks showed a larger drop in blood glucose than people who just pressed a key repeatedly.  In the same study, a sugary drink improved performance on one of the tasks, but not the others.  At Liverpool John Moores University volunteers performed two versions of the Stroop task, in which they had to identify the color of ink in which a word was printed, rather than reading the word itself: In one version, the words and colors matched — BLUE appeared in blue ink;  in the tricky version, the word BLUE appeared in green or red ink.  Volunteers who performed the more challenging task showed bigger dips in blood glucose, which the researchers interpreted as a direct cause of greater mental effort.  Complicating matters, some studies have found that when people are not very good at a particular task, they exert more mental effort and use more glucose, whereas at least one study suggests the opposite — that the more skilled you are, the more efficient your brain is and the less glucose you need.\r\n\r\n Not so simple sugars\r\n Unsatisfying and contradictory findings from glucose studies underscore that energy consumption in the brain is not a simple matter of greater mental effort sapping more of the body's available energy.  Claude Messier of the University of Ottawa has reviewed many such studies.  He remains unconvinced that any one cognitive task measurably changes glucose levels in the brain or blood.  \"In theory, yes, a more difficult mental task requires more energy because there is more neural activity,\" he says, \"but when people do one mental task you won't see a large increase of glucose consumption as a significant percentage of the overall rate.  The base level is quite a lot of energy — even in slow-wave sleep with very little activity there is still a high baseline consumption of glucose.\"  Most organs do not require so much energy for basic housekeeping.  But the brain must actively maintain appropriate concentrations of charged particles across the membranes of billions of neurons, even when those cells are not firing.  Because of this expensive and continuous maintenance, the brain usually has the energy it needs for a little extra work.\r\n\r\n Authors of other review papers have reached similar conclusions.  Robert Kurzban of the University of Pennsylvania points to studies showing that moderate exercise improves people's ability to focus.  In one study, for example, children who walked for 20 minutes on a treadmill performed better on an academic achievement test than children who read quietly before the exam.  If mental effort and ability were a simple matter of available glucose, then the children who exercised — and burnt up more energy — should have performed worse than their quiescent peers.\r\n\r\n The influence of a mental task's difficulty on energy consumption \"appears to be subtle and probably depends on individual variation in effort required, engagement and resources available, which might be related to variables such as age, personality and gluco-regulation,\" wrote Leigh Gibson of Roehampton University in a review on carbohydrates and mental function.\r\n\r\n Both Gibson and Messier conclude that when someone has trouble regulating glucose properly — or has fasted for a long time — a sugary drink or food can improve their subsequent performance on certain kinds of memory tasks.  But for most people, the body easily supplies what little extra glucose the brain needs for additional mental effort.\r\n\r\n Body and mind\r\n If challenging cognitive tasks consume only a little more fuel than usual, what explains the feeling of mental exhaustion following the SAT or a similarly grueling mental marathon?  One answer is that maintaining unbroken focus or navigating demanding intellectual territory for several hours really does burn enough energy to leave one feeling drained, but that researchers have not confirmed this because they have simply not been tough enough on their volunteers.  In most experiments, participants perform a single task of moderate difficulty, rarely for more than an hour or two.  \"Maybe if we push them harder, and get people to do things they are not good at, we would see clearer results,\" Messier suggests.\r\n\r\n Equally important to the duration of mental exertion is one's attitude toward it.  Watching a thrilling biopic with a complex narrative excites many different brain regions for a good two hours, yet people typically do not shamble out of the theater complaining of mental fatigue.  Some people regularly curl up with densely written novels that others might throw across the room in frustration.  Completing a complex crossword or sudoku puzzle on a Sunday morning does not usually ruin one's ability to focus for the rest of the day — in fact, some claim it sharpens their mental state.  In short, people routinely enjoy intellectually invigorating activities without suffering mental exhaustion.\r\n\r\n Such fatigue seems much more likely to follow sustained mental effort that we do not seek for pleasure — such as the obligatory SAT — especially when we expect that the ordeal will drain our brains.  If we think an exam or puzzle will be difficult, it often will be.  Studies have shown that something similar happens when people exercise and play sports: a large component of physical exhaustion is in our heads.  In related research, volunteers that cycled on an exercise bike following a 90-minute computerized test of sustained attention quit pedaling from exhaustion sooner than participants that watched emotionally neutral documentaries before exercising.  Even if the attention test did not consume significantly more energy than watching movies, the volunteers reported feeling less energetic.  That feeling was powerful enough to limit their physical performance.\r\n\r\n In the specific case of the SAT, something beyond pure mental effort likely contributes to post-exam stupor: stress.  After all, the brain does not function in a vacuum.  Other organs burn up energy, too.  Taking an exam that partially determines where one will spend the next four years is nerve-racking enough to send stress hormones swimming through the blood stream, induce sweating, quicken heart rates and encourage fidgeting and contorted body postures.  The SAT and similar trials are not just mentally taxing — they are physically exhausting, too."

Many of the games we play now have come from Britain.  One of the most British games is cricket.  It is often played in schools, colleges, universities and by club teams all over the country.  Summer isn't summer without cricket.  To many Englishmen cricket is both a game and a standard of behaviour.  When they consider anything unfair, they sometimes say \"That isn't cricket\".  But as almost everywhere else in the world, the game, which attracts the greatest attention is Association football, or soccer.  Every Saturday from late August till the beginning of May, large crowds of people support their favourite sides in football grounds.  True fans will travel from one end of the country to the other to see their team play.  There are plenty of professional and amateur soccer clubs all over Britain.  International football matches and the Cup Finals take place at Wembley.  Rugby football is also very popular and mainly amateurs play it.  Next to football, the chief spectator sport in British life is horseracing.  A lot of people are interested in the races and risk money on the horse, which they think will win.  The Derby is perhaps the most famous single sporting event in the whole world.  Britain is also famous for motorcar racing, dog-racing, boat-racing, and even races for donkeys.  The famous boat race between the teams of Oxford and Cambridge attracts large crowds of people.  A great number of people play and watch tennis.  Tennis tournaments at Wimbledon are known all over the world.  The innumerable tennis courts of Britain are occupied by people between the ages of 16 and 60 who show every degree of skill - from practically helpless to the extremely able.  The British also like to play golf, baseball, hockey, and grass-hockey.  Various forms of athletics, such as running, jumping, swimming, and boxing are also popular.  You can sometimes hear that there are no winter sports in England.  Of course the English weather is not always cold enough to ski, skate, or toboggan, but winter is a good season for hunting and fishing.  Indeed sport in one form or another is an essential part of daily life in Britain"

The celebration starts with the second new moon after the beginning of winter (December 21) and lasts until the next full moon.\r\n The Chinese name their years after 12 different animals: the rat, the ox, the tiger, the hare, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the sheep, the monkey, the rooster, the dog, the pig.  Some people believe that ahuman being’s personality and character depends on the animal of the year he or she was born.\r\n The Chinese New Year marks the start of the next animal’s year.  After the year of the pig the twelve year cycle starts over again with the year of the rat.\r\n A lot of things are done for Chinese New Year.  Houses are cleaned from top to bottom in the days before the beginning of the holidays.  People write merry wishes on red paper and hang them all over the house.  Rooms are decorated with flowers, plants and oranges.\r\n On New Year’s Eve firecrackers send out the old year and welcome the new one.  At midnight people open all their doors and windows to let the old year out.  On New Year’s Day children and adults who are not married get red envelopes with money in them.  This is a symbol of good look and wealth in the new year.\r\n Food plays an important part in Chinese New Year celebrations.  Special dishes are eaten on certain days.  Many kinds of food have special meanings.  Uncut noodles, for example, might give you a longer life.  People who eat a lot of raw fish are said to be more successful in life.\r\n The last event of the 15-day celebration is the Lantern Festival.  Some people hang glowing lanterns in temples.  Others carry lanterns in a moonlight parade.  In many places long colourful dragons made out of silk, paper and bamboo are carried on the streets by dancers"

The Englishmen love sports, they are called sports-lovers in spite of the fact that some of them neither play games nor even watch them.  They only like to speak about sports.  Some kinds of sport are professional in England.  Many traditional sporting contests take place in England, for example, cricket.  It is played from May till September.  This game is associated with England.  There are many cricket clubs in this country.  English people like to play cricket.  They think that summer without cricket isn't summer.  Cricket is the English national sport in summer.  If you want to play cricket you must wear white boots, a white shirt and white long trousers.  There are two teams.  Each team has eleven players.  Cricket is popular in boys' schools.  Girls play cricket too.  Football.  It has got a long history.  Football was played by the whole village teams in the middle ages in England.  Now football is the most popular game in Britain.  It is a team game.  There are some amateur teams but most of the teams are professional ones in England.  Professional football is a big business.  Football is played at schools too.  Rugby football.  You can see a ball in this game, but it is not round.  It is oval.  This is a team game.  There are fifteen players in each team.  It is a popular game in England.  There are many amateur rug-by football teams in this country.  If we speak about football we can mention an American football too.  It is a game that is played between two teams of players using an oval ball that can be handled or kicked.  The captain of the team must be the oldest or best player.  Table tennis or ping-pong.  Englishmen heard about table tennis in 1880.  Then the International Table Tennis Association was formed and the international rules were worked out.  Many people like to play table tennis.  This game is played by men and women.  There are some tennis clubs in England, but if you play there it is necessary to pay money for it.  Englishmen like playing tennis but many of them prefer to watch this game.  Wimbledon.  It is the centre of lawn tennis.  Some years ago Wimbledon was a village, now it is a part of London.  The most important tennis competition takes place there every summer.  Englishmen pay much attention to swimming, rowing and walking.  Usually the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race takes place at the end of March or at the beginning of April.  It is an interesting contest between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.  It is usually held on the Thames River.  The first such race was held in 1820.  There were a lot of people watching this race.  There are some racing competitions in England.  They are motor-car racing, dog-racing, donkey-racing, boat-racing, horse-racing.  All kinds of racings are popular in England.  It is interesting to see the egg-and-spoon race.  The runner, who takes part in this competition, must carry an egg in a spoon.  It is not allowed to drop the egg.  We must speak about the Highland Games in Scotland.  All competitors wear Highland dress.  There are such competitions as putting the weight, tossing the caber and others.  The English are great lovers of sports."

Boxing is very popular especially in the large towns and important boxing matches are attended by many spectators.  Horse-racing is also a great national sport.  Among games football and cricket take the first place in public interest.  Huge crowds watch the matches between the most important clubs, while practically every school or large business firm has its own particular cricket and football clubs.  Tennis is another very popular game while golf has firmly established itself in favour and there are golf-links all over the country.  The numerous rivers afford excellent opportunities for swimming and rowing and the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race, in which crews from these two universities compete take place every spring on the Thames."

Certainly, they do not think that play is more important than work;  they mean to say that he will do his work better if he plays as well.\r\n\r\n Among popular games are association football, cricket, golf, snooker, tennis.\r\n\r\n Association football, or soccer, is one of the most popular games in the British Isles.  It is played from late August until the beginning of May.\r\n\r\n Cricket is played mostly in summer.  When the English say \"that's not the cricket\", it means \"that's not fair\";  \"to play the game\" means \"to be fair\".\r\n\r\n As far as golf is concerned, it is Scotland's chief contribution to British sport.\r\n\r\n It is worth mentioning here an interesting feature of sporting life in Britain., namely, its close connection with social class of the players or spectators except where a game may be called \"a national \" sport.\r\n\r\n This is cricket in England which is played and watched by all classes.\r\n\r\n Golf is everywhere in the British Isles is a middle-class activity.\r\n\r\n Soccer is naturally a working class sport.\r\n\r\n Walking and swimming are equally undertaken by men and women.\r\n\r\n Snooker (billiards), pool and darts are popular mostly among men.\r\n\r\n Aerobics (keep-fit exercises), yoga, squash and cycling are among the sports where participation has been increasing in recent years.\r\n\r\n There are several places in Britain associated with a particular kind of sport.\r\n\r\n One of them is Wimbledon - a suburb to the South of London where All-England Lawn Tennis Championships have been held in July since 1877. The other one is Wimbley where international football matches, the Cup Finals have been taking place since 1923.\r\n\r\n The third one is Derby, the most famous flat race in the English racing calendar."

        "text":"Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima.\r\n -Raymond Lully.\r\n\r\n I AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion.  Men have called me mad;  but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence — whether much that is glorious- whether all that is profound — does not spring from disease of thought — from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect.  They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.  In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret.  In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.  They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless into the vast ocean of the \"light ineffable,\" and again, like the adventures of the Nubian geographer, \"agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.\"\r\n\r\n We will say, then, that I am mad.  I grant, at least, that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence — the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life — and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being.  Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period, believe;  and to what I may relate of the later time, give only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.\r\n\r\n She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed.  Eleonora was the name of my cousin.  We had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.  No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale;  for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses.  No path was trodden in its vicinity;  and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers.  Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley — I, and my cousin, and her mother.\r\n\r\n From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora;  and, winding stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued.  We called it the \"River of Silence\";  for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.  No murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever.\r\n\r\n The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom, — these spots, not less than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.\r\n\r\n And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley.  Their mark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of Eleonora;  so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria doing homage to their sovereign the Sun.\r\n\r\n Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts.  It was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our images therein.  We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few.  We had drawn the God Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers.  The passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.  A change fell upon all things.  Strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before.  The tints of the green carpet deepened;  and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel.  And life arose in our paths;  for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.  The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora.  And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.\r\n\r\n The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim;  but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers.  No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein.\r\n\r\n At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive variation of phrase.\r\n\r\n She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom — that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die;  but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of Silence.  She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world.  And, then and there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth — that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me.  And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow.  And the curse which I invoked of Him and of her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here.  And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew brighter at my words;  and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast;  and she trembled and very bitterly wept;  but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?)  and it made easy to her the bed of her death.  And she said to me, not many days afterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night;  but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels.  And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.\r\n\r\n Thus far I have faithfully said.  But as I pass the barrier in Times path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record.  But let me on.  — Years dragged themselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass;  but a second change had come upon all things.  The star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more.  The tints of the green carpet faded;  and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels withered away;  and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew.  And Life departed from our paths;  for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company.  And the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.  And the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original silence.  And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.\r\n\r\n Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten;  for I heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels;  and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley;  and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs;  and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and once — oh, but once only!  I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.\r\n\r\n But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled.  I longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing.  At length the valley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.\r\n\r\n I found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.  The pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women, bewildered and intoxicated my brain.  But as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night.  Suddenly these manifestations they ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible temptations which beset me;  for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once — at whose footstool I bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love.  What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?  — Oh, bright was the seraph Ermengarde!  and in that knowledge I had room for none other.  — Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde!  and as I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them — and of her.\r\n\r\n I wedded;  — nor dreaded the curse I had invoked;  and its bitterness was not visited upon me.  And once — but once again in the silence of the night;  there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me;  and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Sleep in peace!  — for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.\""

I could tell you what the story's about, but why not let He-Man tell you himself?\r\n\r\n He-Man: I am Adam, Prince of Eternia and defender of the secrets of Castle Grayskull.\r\n\r\n NC: A prince, really?  I never would've guessed.\r\n\r\n He-Man: Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me the day I held aloft my magic sword and said \"By the Power of Grayskull!\"\r\n\r\n NC: I guess he was just going through that \"holding aloft your magic sword and saying by the Power of Grayskull\" phase.  But, luckily they happen to contain super powers.\r\n\r\n He-Man: And I became...HE-MAN!  The most powerful man in the universe!\r\n\r\n NC: Except for Lou Schimer, who apparently always gets top billing.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So you get the idea, He-Man took place in another dimension where he defended the Castle Grayskull from the evil Skeletor.  It wasn't a great show, but we enjoyed watching it.  And years later, people still like to talk about the gay overtones this show gave us.\r\n\r\n NC: Now many of you might be saying \"No!  He-Man isn't gay, how dare you say something like that!\"  Well, anyone who's still in question about this should take a look at the 1987 motion picture epic Masters of the Universe.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): A film that teaches us it's okay to be gay, but NOT a godawful piece of retro-crap.\r\n\r\n NC: So let's just jump in and take a look at the first problem with this movie...the title.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Why the hell is it just called Masters of the Universe and not He-Man: Masters of the Universe?  I mean half of us didn't even know this WAS a He-Man movie, cause we never cared what came after the He-Man title.  I mean all we ever heard was\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): He-Man...something something.  So why didn't they leave it in?  I don't know, believe me, that's the least of this movie's problems.\r\n\r\n Kevin: Oh my God.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So the story begins at Castle Grayskull, which apparently is located in the Grand Canyon.  The evil Skeletor has taken over the castle, but is angry because he looks like how John McCain will look in a couple of years.  The only one who can stop Skeletor is the always shirtless He-Man, who's played by Dolph Lundgren.  You know, the Russian guy from Rocky 4.\r\n\r\n Ivan Drago: I must break you.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Trust me, I'd rather have you break me than sit through this ass-fest.  This guy is so foreign that I think even he forgets what accent he's supposed to have.\r\n\r\n NC: It sounds Germ-Russian-ese.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So He-Man is accompanied by his team, led by Man of Arms, who's pretty damn old compared to the cartoon.  But not as old as John McCain in just a few years.\r\n\r\n NC: Okay, okay...that's the last John McCain joke I'll make.  ...intentionally.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): He's also joined by Teela, Man of Arms' daughter-\r\n\r\n Teela: Woman at Arms\r\n\r\n NC: Hey hey, that's not funny!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): And Wildor, who I guess is supposed to be like Orko, but again, why can't they just make it like the show and call him Orko?  Sure he looks like the gay love-child of Yoda from Star Wars and Gizmo from Gremlins, but we're not that picky.  You could still call him Orko and we'd buy it.  And speaking of gay, just look at this first action sequence and tell me there's no homoerotic themes going on here.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): It's like Star Wars, but...gayer.\r\n\r\n NC: Dude, did he just zap that guy in the crotch?\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Actually, there's a lot of shots to the crotch in this movie.  Talk about great balls of fire!\r\n\r\n NC: But again, no gay overtones.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So it turns out Skeletor is after Wildor because he's invented a cosmic key that can take you to any dimension you want.  Skeletor wants this device so he can—you guessed it—take over the world.\r\n\r\n M. Bison: Of course!\r\n\r\n Skeletor: People of Eternia...the war is over.  Those who do not pledge themselves to me shall be destroyed!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Sounds like John McCain's inaugural speech to me.\r\n\r\n NC: Okay, okay...I don't even dislike the guy it's just the jokes are too easy.  I'll try to do better.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So it turns out Skeletor has also captured an enchanted sorceress known as...well, the Sorceress.  He-Man tries to negotiate for her freedom.\r\n\r\n He-Man: Let her go.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: I don't think so.\r\n\r\n NC: Negotiations over!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): He-Man tries to save the Sorceress but appears outnumbered.  So Wildor opens up the key and sends them to another dimension.  It's like Back to the Future!  Only...gayer.  So He-Man and his team use the cosmic key to end up in which parallel dimension?  Ours of course, right dab in the middle of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n NC: So let me get this straight.  He-Man, the Master of the Universe, is going to use all his intergalactic weaponry, and medieval-style fighting moves...in the suburbs of New Jersey?\r\n\r\n NC: This is gonna suck, isn't it?\r\n\r\n Cop: Holy Shit!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Alright, so He-Man is stuck in New Jersey as they're looking for the planet's inhabitants.\r\n\r\n Man of Arms: Alien lifeform...big.\r\n\r\n Teela: Let me blast them.\r\n\r\n Man of Arms: Wait!  It might be intelligent life.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): In this movie?  I doubt that.\r\n\r\n NC: Oh look!  It's the best actor in the movie!\r\n\r\n NC: At least that line didn't sound rehearsed!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Okay, so what's the epic hero He-Man and his mighty crew's first order of duty?  To steal buckets of chicken from a second-rate drive-thru restaurant!\r\n\r\n NC: ...of course!\r\n\r\n Man of Arms: Good food.  Never think while you're hungry.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): One of the people who works at that fast food restaurant is Julie, played strangely enough by Courtney Cox.\r\n\r\n Coworker: If you break up with Kevin Corrigan, you will regret it for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n Julie: Kevin's changed, I've changed.\r\n\r\n Coworker: A, you still love him and B, he still loves you.\r\n\r\n NC: When did this turn into Dawson's Creek?\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): She's bummed because apparently her folks died in some sort of plane accident a year ago.  Isn't this just what you think of when you think of a He-Man movie?\r\n\r\n Kevin: Your mom and dad wouldn't want you to go around the rest of your life blaming yourself.  Would they?\r\n\r\n Julie: No...\r\n \"He-Man and the Masters of the Depressing Plot Expositions\" title sequence\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, Skeletor tracks down their position and sends out his evil team to find them.  By the way, is it me, or did this guy REALLY like dramatic turns?\r\n\r\n NC: Seriously, I wish I had dramatic music everytime I turned my head.  I mean what would-\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So Julie and her boyfriend find the cosmic key as Skeletor's troops close in on them.  Look at these guys, they look like the Thundercats on the way to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.\r\n\r\n Kevin: Yeah, that's what I thought too.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Julie and her boyfriend are separated as Julie comes under attack by Skeletor's Muppet demons.  He-Man senses babes and decides he wants to go after her.  Once again we get an erotic dance number which I suppose is supposed to be an action sequence.  I'm sorry, why does He-Man carry a sword and everyone else carries a laser?  I mean what is the purpose?\r\n\r\n Wildor: I don't know, I don't know!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): After He-Man rescues Julie, he decides to tell her exactly what he's looking for.\r\n\r\n He-Man: Have you seen it?  It's this large and has lights on it.\r\n\r\n NC: But AGAIN, no gay overtones.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, Julie's boyfriend meets up with a cop played by the principal from Back to the Future.  His job is to bitch and moan as often as possible.\r\n\r\n Cop: You can't order me around!  What is this, a circus act?  That's vandalism, I got arson.  What the hell is goin' on out there?  We got stuff blowin' up in my face!  Choice, really choice.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): This guy is so annoying he makes Chris Tucker seem like James Earl Jones.  Most of the time he's not even solving any crimes.  He's just making fun of Julie's boyfriend and messing around with that cosmic key.  Is it really wise to mess around with a dimensional manipulator?  I mean, you never know what kinda damage you could be causing.\r\n\r\n Cop: I don't think this is any synthesizer.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Looking for the key, He-Man and his heroic crew decide to go traveling around the city IN A PINK CADILLAC.\r\n\r\n NC: Alright, these are no longer gay overtones, this is an ORCHESTRA of gayness.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, Skeletor himself arrives on Earth, bringing all of his evil armies with him.  ...How does nobody in the city know this is going on?  I mean, are there really people looking out their windows right now saying\r\n\r\n NC: Boy that neighborhood watch is really cracking down.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, Julie's boyfriend and Mr. Clean continue to argue and bicker as no doubt bigger and better action scenes could be taking place right now.  Watching these two is like watching an episode of Mad About You.  Only...gayer.\r\n\r\n Cop: SHUT UP!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Actually, I think I realize why the title of this movie wasn't called He-Man.  Because He-Man's never in it!  Most of the time it's just focusing on his team, Courtney Cox, or the odd couple here.\r\n\r\n Wildor: I don't believe it!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Everyone eventually meets up at a record store, where I swear to God the weirdest combination of lines and images come together.  I mean, just try watching this whole scene with a straight face.\r\n\r\n Cop: Freeze, all of you.  Let's start with you, blondie.\r\n\r\n Wildor: He-Man, He-Man!\r\n\r\n Cop: What the hell is that?\r\n\r\n Wildor: Neutrino Drive, it's heeeeere!\r\n\r\n He-Man: Wildor, how long to calculate the coordinates and bring us home?\r\n\r\n Teela: If you'd rather stay here and face Evilynn's commandos, that's fine with me.\r\n\r\n Kevin: Look, believe me sir, you wouldn't.\r\n\r\n NC: Alright, someone has gone batshit crazy!  It's either me, or the movie makers.  Either way, I am very concerned.\r\n\r\n Cop: I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone or something!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So finally Skeletor's army appears and they have to have an epic battle in a record store.  A record store, I can't even believe I'm saying this.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: How sensitive you are...\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, one of Skeletor's henchmen poses as Julie's mother, who just so happened to come back from the dead and needs that cosmic key inside.  Yeah, this doesn't sound like a set-up at all.\r\n\r\n Evilynn: Thank you my darling...\r\n\r\n Julie: NOOOOO!\r\n\r\n NC: Baaaah!  I totally didn't see that coming.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: I think not!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): I'm sorry, but wasn't this trick used once in Spaceballs?  That's pretty bad when a film is so desperate for ideas that it starts ripping off Mel Brooks sci-fi comedies.  So Skeletor gets the key and demands He-Man to be his slave or else he'll kill his teammates.  He-Man agrees as his friends are left behind with the other half of the key.  Julie's boyfriend wonders why they can't just find their key to find Skeletor.  But hairy knolls tells him he can't remember the exact notes that would transport them back.  Yeah, apparently the key operates on notes instead of numbers or letters.  So of course, being the 80s, it's synthesized music to the rescue, as they rock their way to the exact coordinates.  Pretty lame...\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Back in Eternia, Skeletor SOMEHOW got He-Man into even less clothes and tortures him with some kind of holographic twizzler whip or something.  Look at this, he's actually leaning his butt into the whip, as if he's actually enjoying it!\r\n\r\n NC: (whispering) No gay overtones.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): And I guess He-Man's sword is the only thing that can give Skeletor supreme power in the universe or I don't know, some shit like that.  So he plugs it into his Nintendo chair and absorbs all the powers of the cosmos.  While making the longest goddamn speech in the friggin' world.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: The power fills me!  Yes!  I feel the universe within me!  I am...I am a part of the cosmos.  Its energy flows...flows through me!  Of what consequence are you now?  This planet, these people, they are NOTHING to me!  The universe is power!  True, unstoppable POWER!  And I am that force, I am that power!  KNEEL BEFORE YOUR MASTER!\r\n\r\n Skeletor: So, you are no longer my equal...I am more than man.  More than LIFE!\r\n\r\n Skeletor: I.. . am...a.. . GOD!!!!!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): God, that speech is so long-winded and pointless it's like being at a John McCain rally.\r\n\r\n NC: Oh what, it slipped.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So after his speech is over, Skeletor uses his demonic powers to become...a gay, metallic Chiquita Banana-nator.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: WHAT?!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): But before he can destroy our hero, He-Man's friends come in to save the day.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: Farewell...He-Man.\r\n\r\n NC: Wow, the ruler of the universe has really lousy aim.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So He-Man breaks free and starts using his manly strength to defeat the soldiers.  He does this by pushing over statues that are SO strong, they actually bounce when they hit the ground.\r\n\r\n NC: ...I guess they've been in the sun too long?\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So He-Man gets his sword back and battles the evil Skeletor-metallic-banana thingy.  It's kind of like Conan, only...well you know.  This battle takes forever, but He-Man finally defeats old skull and crossbones.\r\n\r\n He-Man: It's over.\r\n\r\n NC: Oh good!  I thought this movie was never gonna end.\r\n\r\n Skeletor: Yes...FOR YOU!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Okay, so He-Man defeats Skeletor AGAIN and then throws him into a gigantic endless pit.  Is it me, or is this the slowest fall in the history of slowest falls?  I think the movie could actually wrap up and he'd still be falling!\r\n\r\n Julie: He-Man...Teela, Man of Arms, don't...don't say goodbye.\r\n\r\n Man of Arms: There's an old Eternian saying: Live the journey, for every destination is but a doorway to another.\r\n\r\n He-Man: You look after her now.\r\n\r\n Kevin: I will.\r\n\r\n He-Man: Activate the doorway, Wildor.\r\n\r\n Wildor: Are you sure you don't wanna go back to your father's history? *\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus and the Nereid Thetis.  He was the mightiest of the Greeks who fought in the Trojan War, and was the hero of Homer's Iliad.\r\n\r\n Achilles Thetis attempted unsuccessfully to make her son immortal.  There are two versions of the story.  In the earlier version, Thetis anointed the infant with ambrosia and then placed him upon a fire to burn away his mortal portions;  she was interrupted by Peleus, whereupon she abandoned both father and son in a rage.  Peleus placed the child in the care of the Centaur Chiron, who raised and educated the boy.  In the later version, she held the young Achilles by the heel and dipped him in the river Styx;  everything the sacred waters touched became invulnerable, but the heel remained dry and therefore unprotected.\r\n\r\n When Achilles was a boy, the seer Calchas prophesied that the city of Troy could not be taken without his help.  Thetis knew that, if her son went to Troy, he would die an early death, so she sent him to the court of Lycomedes, in Scyros;  there he was hidden, disguised as a young girl.  During his stay he had an affair with Lycomedes' daughter, Deidameia, and she had a son, Pyrrhus (or Neoptolemus), by him.  Achilles' disguise was finally penetrated by Odysseus, who placed arms and armor amidst a display of women's finery and seized upon Achilles when he was the only \"maiden\" to be fascinated by the swords and shields.  Achilles then went willingly with Odysseus to Troy, leading a host of his father's Myrmidons and accompanied by his tutor Phoenix and his close friend Patroclus.  At Troy, Achilles distinguished himself as an undefeatable warrior.  Among his other exploits, he captured twenty-three towns in Trojan territory, including the town of Lyrnessos, where he took the woman Briseis as a war-prize.  Later on Agamemnon, the leader of the Greeks, was forced by an oracle of Apollo to give up his own war-prize, the woman Chryseis, and took Briseis away from Achilles as compensation for his loss.  This action sparked the central plot of the Iliad, for Achilles became enraged and refused to fight for the Greeks any further.  The war went badly, and the Greeks offered handsome reparations to their greatest warrior;  Achilles still refused to fight in person, but he agreed to allow his friend Patroclus to fight in his place, wearing his armor.  The next day Patroclus was killed and stripped of the armor by the Trojan hero Hector, who mistook him for Achilles.\r\n\r\n Achilles was overwhelmed with grief for his friend and rage at Hector.  His mother obtained magnificent new armor for him from Hephaestus, and he returned to the fighting and killed Hector.  He desecrated the body, dragging it behind his chariot before the walls of Troy, and refused to allow it to receive funeral rites.  When Priam, the king of Troy and Hector's father, came secretly into the Greek camp to plead for the body, Achilles finally relented;  in one of the most moving scenes of the Iliad, he received Priam graciously and allowed him to take the body away.\r\n\r\n After the death of Hector, Achilles' days were numbered.  He continued fighting heroically, killing many of the Trojans and their allies, including Memnon and the Amazon warrior Penthesilia.  Finally Priam's son Paris (or Alexander), aided by Apollo, wounded Achilles in the heel with an arrow;  Achilles died of the wound.  After his death, it was decided to award Achilles' divinely-wrought armor to the bravest of the Greeks.  Odysseus and Ajax competed for the prize, with each man making a speech explaining why he deserved the honor;  Odysseus won, and Ajax then went mad and committed suicide.\r\n\r\n During his lifetime, Achilles is also said to have had a number of romantic episodes.  He reportedly fell in love with Penthesilia, the Amazon maiden whom he killed in battle, and it is claimed that he married Medea."

Miracles happen everyday. \r\n Always accept an outstretched hand. \r\n Be brave.  Even if you're not, pretend to be.  No one can tell the difference. \r\n Whistle. \r\n Avoid sarcastic remarks. \r\n Choose your life's mate carefully.  From this one decision will come 90 per cent of all your happiness or misery. \r\n Make it a habit to do nice things for people who will never find out. \r\n Lend only those books you never care to see again. \r\n Never deprive someone of hope;  it might be all that they have. \r\n When playing games with children, let them win. \r\n Give people a second chance, but not a third. \r\n Be romantic. \r\n Become the most positive and enthusiastic person you know. \r\n Loosen up.  Relax.  Except for rare life-and-death matters, nothing is as important as it first seems. \r\n Don't allow the phone to interrupt important moments.  It's there for our convenience, not the caller's. \r\n Be a good loser. \r\n Be a good winner. \r\n Think twice before burdening a friend with a secret. \r\n When someone hugs you, let them be the first to let go. \r\n Be modest.  A lot was accomplished before you were born. \r\n Keep it simple. \r\n Beware of the person who has nothing to lose. \r\n Don't burn bridges.  You'll be surprised how many times you have to cross the same river. \r\n Live your life so that your epitaph could read: \"No Regrets\". \r\n Be bold and courageous.  When you look back on life, you'll regret the things you didn't do more than the one's you did. \r\n Never waste an opportunity to tell someone you love them. \r\n Remember, no one makes it alone.  Have a grateful heart and be quick to acknowledge those who helped you. \r\n Take charge of your attitude.  Don't let someone else choose it for you. \r\n Visit friends and relatives when they are in hospital;  you need only stay a few minutes. \r\n Begin each day with some of your favorite music. \r\n Once in a while, take the scenic route. \r\n Send a lot of Valentine cards.  Sign them, 'Someone who thinks you're terrific.' \r\n Answer the phone with enthusiasm and energy in your voice. \r\n Keep a note pad and pencil on your bed-side table.  Million-dollar ideas sometimes strike at 3 a.m. \r\n Show respect for everyone who works for a living, regardless of how trivial their job. \r\n Send your loved ones flowers.  Think of a reason later. \r\n Make someone's day by paying the toll for the person in the car behind you. \r\n Become someone's hero. \r\n Marry only for love. \r\n Count your blessings. \r\n Compliment the meal when you're a guest in someone's home. \r\n Wave at the children on a school bus. \r\n Remember that 80 per cent of the success in any job is based on your ability to deal with people. \r\n Don't expect life to be fair, but don`t be unfair yourself.\r\n\r\n Like it - \"Нравится\".

'When I've gone, the children won't remember me, 'she tells herself.  ' I don't exist in their time  —  not on 5 April 1944.'\r\n She cannot see the ground.  She won't be able to see it until she is almost out of the window.  She won't be able to change her mind  —  to go back.\r\n She jumps ... she is falling.  The ground is far below her.\r\n Elise hits the ground.  She hears the CRACK!  of her foot before the pain from her fall shoots up her leg.  She wants to scream with the pain.  And more pain is coming from her chest.\r\n 'You can't scream,' she tells herself.  'You'll wake the children in the house.  They'll call Sabina and she'll lock me in.  Stefan will look at me and say, \"How could you go and leave us?\"'\r\n So Elise puts her hand into her mouth.  She tastes blood.  The voice that said 'Go!  now' says softly, 'All this is not really happening.  '\r\n 'Oh no?  Tell that to my foot and my chest!'\r\n She orders herself to move, but her body does not want to know her.  She is shaking with pain.  Move!  How?  On hands and knees!\r\n 'They tell you to do this in the camps,' she remembers.  'And if you don't, they pull you along.  To the shower rooms.  They order you to take off your clothes.  Throw your shoes on the pile.  Nice showers after a long journey.  Not me!'  Move!\r\n Her chest screams with pain.  'How far can you get like this?  You won't even reach the corner, and they'll find you in the morning.  You'll be the first person that they put on the lorry.'\r\n Now Elise's arms and hands, and her good leg, are working for her.  She has moved on to dry ground.  She wants to get far away from the window.  She will have to live with the pain.  This will not kill her, not yet.  But she cannot look again at the children's faces.  They trusted her.\r\n She is moving faster now.  Suddenly she thinks, 'Did Eloise tell the Germans about their hiding place?'  And then, 'Will Sabina, Stefan and the children think I told the Germans?'  She begins to cry.  'No, no!'  She is talking to Eloise now.  ' I won't believe it.  You're honest and good, I know it.  Different,  yes,  but good.'\r\n At last Elise gets round the corner.  There is a soft wind here, coming off the hills.  ' I need something to walk with,' she thinks.  She looks around her.  The moon is out, and the stars.  It is a beautiful night.  Too beautiful for all this.\r\n She sees something against the wall in front of her.  It is a large fork.  Elise uses it to help her walk.  In front of her and up the hill are trees and rocks that she can hide in.  From the top of the hill there will be a wonderful view over the river.  But the children will never see it.  And the river will not stop moving.  It knows nothing of people's happiness or pain.\r\n Elise continues, taking small steps.  The fork is a good 'leg', but it doesn't like hills.\r\n 'What will I tell Dad?  He'll have to take me to hospital.  Well here's a story for your notebook, Dad.  I'll have to stay in the house.  Carol won't like that.  She'll have to stop painting and feed me with hot soup.  But then I won't have to be silent all the time.  And you  —  wait!  You are crazy!  This isn't Stephen country.  It's Stefan country.  It's 5 April 1944.  Or, no  —  this pain!  - it's 6 April.\"\r\n She remembers the other Stefan.  The mysterious boy on the church steps.  'Why was he afraid of me?  Now I know!\r\n 'I need a place to lie down.  I must sleep  —  rest.'  Elise falls over a stone.  The fork catches behind her good leg and she falls ...  She is too tired to protect herself.  She falls on to soft earth.\r\n CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n The Lorries\r\n\r\n Elise wakes up and the pain is the same.  It is early morning and there is a pale sun in the sky.\r\n 'I can't get away from here,' she thinks.  'Dad will miss me.  And he did tell me: In this beautiful countryside, there are murderers ...\r\n That's true than you realize, Dad.  And what will Carol think?  Wasn't she cold towards me?  Didn't she want me to live with my Mum?  Perhaps people are looking for me already.  Oh please find me before it's too late!'\r\n She checks her state of health.  She has slept on her left side.  Her chest hurts.  She tries to move, but then her head hurts.  She exercises her neck.\r\n 'I can do it,' she tells herself.  'I've got to.'  She smells the fresh grass.  It gives her hope.  And from somewhere above her she hears the birds singing.  'I've got to get away.  But where to?'\r\n She is not safe  —  she is too near the farm.  She reaches for the fork.  ' I must get into the trees, and lie down.'\r\n Suddenly there are sounds from the village.  The sounds of lorries!\r\n Elise pulls herself towards a low wall of rock.\r\n The lorries are leaving the road now and stopping in the yard.  Soldiers jump out of the back.  An officer steps down from the front of one.  He shouts orders.  The Gestapo have finished their work at Belley.  Now it is the turn of Izieu.\r\n Elise forgets the pain in her foot and chest.  She stands up now.  The yard is full of soldiers, holding guns.\r\n Sabina?  There is no Sabina.  Was no one on guard last night?  What happened to the careful eyes of Cerberus?\r\n At the far end of the building, a ground-floor window has opened.  Someone drops into the shadows at the side of the yard.  One will escape.  To tell the story.\r\n The children are brought down.  Some of them are only half-dressed.  There are adults with them too.  They are ordered into the lorries.  Elise can see their faces;  serious, pale and tired.  No questions, no tears.  The gates of the lorries are shut and locked.\r\n The officer is giving an order to someone that Elise cannot see.  He speaks in French.\r\n 'Eloise understands: 'We will stop in the village.  We will show the children to the village people.  Then they will understand that the Gestapo knows everything.  If anyone protests, shoot them.'\r\n As quickly as they came, the lorries leave.  There are no children now at the farm of Lolinoz.  But one got away.  Was it Stefan?\r\n Inside her head, Elise talks to the children.  'Someone told the Germans about you . . '\r\n Strange, but the foot doesn't hurt now.  There is only an ache, like the ache in her heart.  ' I must hurry,' she says to herself.  'Dad likes us all to sit together at lunch.'\r\n But not this way, not past the farm.  No.  The path above her goes up and down between white rocks.  It goes into the village from behind the church.\r\n Poor Sabina.  She will return this evening, walking up the road as usual.  Will the farmer tell her?  Or will he be too afraid to look at her?\r\n 'It was the girl!'  Is that what they will say?  'People saw her in the village.  She probably picked up a phone.  Who told the Gestapo?  How will we ever know?  Eloise  —  she was trouble.  And she wasn't Jewish, remember.'\r\n As she climbs the hill above the valley, Elise looks back at the farm.  There is no sign that there were children there.  But Elise will tell the story of the children of Lolinoz;  the ghosts of Izieu.\r\n CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n Memories\r\n\r\n 'What happened to you?  What's wrong with your foot?'\r\n It was Carol's voice.  Carol with her painting things in front of her.  And the beginnings of a picture of the river, the trees and the rocks.\r\n 'So I wasn't missed,' thought Elise.  'The time is the time when I left.  Nothing has happened.  But everything has happened.  It did happen.  Things only seem to be the same.'\r\n 'I just fell, that's all.'\r\n Carol's work for the morning was finished.  She was happier now.  'Isn't it beautiful here?  So quiet.'\r\n 'What date is it?'  asked Elise.\r\n She was always cold with Carol, so her stepmother was not surprised.  Elise tried again, more softly: 'I'm sorry.'\r\n 'That's OK,'said Carol.' I understand.' \r\n 'Do you?'\r\n 'We really must learn to be friends, Elise.'\r\n 'Today I was called Eloise,' said Elise.\r\n Carol looked at her strangely.  'Are you all right?'\r\n They were walking together down a dusty path towards the church.  Without thinking about it, Elise put her hand around Carol's arm.  This was a surprise;  to both of them.\r\n More kindly now, Elise asked again, 'What date is it, Carol?'  She used her stepmother's name for the first time.\r\n Carol noticed and smiled.  To Elise, she seemed different, almost another person.\r\n 'Well yesterday was 5 April,' said Carol.  'So today . .  .  Oh, there's your Dad by the church.  I'll go and heat the soup.  Bring him in five minutes, OK?\r\n 'Thanks, Carol,' said Elise.\r\n 'For what?'\r\n 'You know  —  for trying.'  Elise's thoughts returned to the farmhouse and her angry talk with Stefan.  'And I've said terrible things.'\r\n Carol put an arm round her stepdaughter and gave her a kiss; \t their first kiss.  'We mustn't stop trying, must we?'\r\n ***\r\n\r\n 'You knew about this place before we came, Dad.  Am I right?'  asked Elise.  She put her arm through his, too.\r\n 'I want you to read this,' said Dad.  There was writing on the metal plate of the war memorial.  Below it were some fresh flowers. \r\n 'Can you understand the French, Elise?\r\n 'This morning I met a boy called Stefan,' said Elise.  'He told me everything.'\r\n Her father read out the story of forty-four children taken from their hiding place in the village.  Taken by the Gestapo.  There were tears in his eyes.\r\n 'They were never seen again,' he said.  He looked at the spring flowers. \r\n 'All this time, but somebody remembers, Elise.'  He stopped, but then continued.  'Where were you taken, little children?  Dachau, probably.  Did I ever tell you, Elise  — '\r\n 'About the trains, Dad?'  Elise said.  The trains, yes.  She remembered the children's 'train' in the farmhouse.\r\n 'We are going on a train?'\r\n 'Where to?'\r\n 'I love trains.'\r\n 'Will it be safe?'\r\n 'What does Madame Sahina say?'\r\n 'Terrible,'said Dad.'  The deaths.  I just can't forget.'\r\n To herself, Elise said, 'You're not the only one who can't forget.'\r\n As they walked back to their holiday home, somebody was watching Elise from the steps of the church.  She turned.  For a second, the entrance to the church was the inside of a Gestapo lorry.  The children were climbing in.  No questions, no tears.  The lorries moved away - to the trains.  One person was left in the shadows of the church.  He lifted a hand and waved to her.\r\n 'Have you hurt your foot, my pet?'  asked Dad, noticing.\r\n Elise fought back her tears.  'Yes, I ... Dad, can we put down some flowers, next to the others?  Wild flowers, from up on the hill?'\r\n 'Why not?'  Dad put his arm round his daughter.  'Things are going to get better now, I promise.'\r\n 'I know,' answered Elise.  'But Dad?' "
