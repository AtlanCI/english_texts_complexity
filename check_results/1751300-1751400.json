        "text":" And he was right: police officers invested as private stockholders in radar cameras, which paid dividends.  If a Zhejiang cop contributed six thousand dollars to an expressway speed trap, he collected 7.5 percent of the proceeds from each ticket.  Investors were limited to four per camera, and rookie cops weren’t allowed to purchase a share until they had accumulated a certain amount of seniority.  High-ranking officers could buy into multiple cameras.  There was a lottery system that determined which cops got which locations on the expressway.  This industry even had a corps of private moneylenders, because people knew it was safe to loan money to a cop who was buying into a speed trap.  Like so many aspects of boomtown life, it wasn’t exactly lawless — in fact there were strict rules that governed police investment.  But these were the rules of hierarchy and profit, not law and order. \r\n  Each speeding ticket added points to a driver’s record, and finally I accumulated so many that I was required by law to take a remedial driving course.  But the manager at the car rental company told me it wouldn’t be necessary if I made a personal visit to the Lishui police station.  At the station, an officer called up my outstanding violations on a computer.  He printed out a series of forms and instructed me to pay at the Bank of China, which was conveniently located across the street.  The most recent tickets came to a total of about sixty dollars. \r\n  “What about the points?”  I asked. \r\n  “I erased them,” the officer said.  “As long as your fee goes through, it won’t be a problem.” \r\n  At the bank I joined a special line dedicated to traffic violations.  A half dozen yuppies were already waiting, and one by one we made our way to the front, where a clerk efficiently handled our money.  It was February;  a big English banner in the lobby said “Merry Christmas.”  That same week I noticed a new sign on the expressway:\r\n \r\n DRIVE SAFELY! \r\n  26 PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON THIS ROAD!\r\n \r\n  BY THE END OF July, the factory still had only four customers, and they had accumulated over a million bra rings in storage.  The Machine stood silent for days at a stretch, and now the factory was clearly in serious trouble.  They stopped calling the part-time assembly-line workers, and they slashed the salaries of all high-level technicians.  Little Long’s wages were cut by 40 percent;  Master Luo’s salary was reduced by half.  This violated the men’s contracts, and in theory they could have complained to the local labor bureau, but Chinese workers rarely take such a step.  They generally have little faith in government — “You have to handle these things yourself,” as Master Luo often said.  He told me that for the time being he’d be patient, and if things didn’t turn around he’d search for another job. \r\n  Master Luo had worked with bra rings for so many years that he dreamed of them at night.  When he slept, he saw rings coming off the Machine’s conveyor belt, and he had visions of piles of rings waiting to be sorted and bagged.  His nightmares usually featured long pointless arguments with bosses.  Once, while we were chatting in the Machine room, Master Luo described the dream that had woken him up the night before.  “We had just gotten a shipment of nylon powder and it wasn’t any good,” he said.  “But Boss Wang said it was fine.  I said, no, it won’t work.  He said it was fine.  I said, no, you’re talking farts!” \r\n  In the factory world, Luo was the kind of person known as a Da Shifu, a “Big Master.”  He was only in his late thirties, but twenty-three of those years had been spent working in plants across China.  And like virtually all masters of his generation, he had grown up on a farm.  His parents raised cotton outside of Songzi, a small city in central China’s Hubei Province.  In the late 1970s, rural schools were terrible, and Master Luo didn’t receive much formal education.  “We had only two textbooks,” he remembered.  “Chinese and mathematics.  That was it.”  By the start of middle school, he was still functionally illiterate, but his parents decided to stop paying school fees.  “They said they needed money, so it would be better if I went out to work.” \r\n  In 1984, at the age of fourteen, he found a job in a toy factory in Hunan Province.  He worked there for a year, sending home much of his twenty-five-dollar-a-month salary.  Soon he made his way to Shenzhen, the special economic zone in the far south that began to boom in the 1980s.  For a while, Master Luo worked in a textile factory, and then he changed jobs again.  It became his pattern: over the course of a decade, he jumped from city to city, factory to factory, product to product.  He manufactured screws in Hubei, and he worked in a paint plant in Xinjiang.  He made plastic bowls in Guangzhou.  He did trade in Yunnan Province, near the Burmese border;  and he worked in a toy factory in northeastern Heilongjiang, near Siberia. \r\n  But eventually he returned to Shenzhen and the other cities of the far south.  Years later, he spoke most fondly of this region, because in Shenzhen he attended private classes during the late 1980s.  “The class started at eight o’clock, and we used to hurry over right after finishing our shift at the factory,” he remembered.  “The class cost five yuan and it was forty-five minutes long.  They covered electrical wiring, machine tooling, welding — anything that’s useful.  The teacher was from Beijing;  he was retired and he was really good.  The class was in a room about this size, but there were more than two hundred people every night.  It was packed because that teacher had such a good reputation.” \r\n  Back then, Master Luo worked sixty hours a week, but he still found time to attend night school.  The financial investment was significant — he earned only five hundred yuan per month, and yet he was willing to spend five yuan every time he attended a lesson.  In development zones, private schools and tutorials are common, because motivated workers know they can rise from the assembly line.  During his twenties, in his spare time, Master Luo also improved his reading and writing, until finally he became fully literate.  In Shenzhen he passed a state-administered exam that granted him a vocational high school diploma. \r\n  Apart from his native intelligence and determination, Master Luo had few natural advantages.  He had grown up in poverty, and he wasn’t good-looking by Chinese standards.  He was short, and he had freckles, which are considered blemishes in China.  He had a heavy brow and a long nose;  his teeth were bad.  But there was an openness to his expression, and he smiled easily, with soft lines of age fanning out across his temples.  He had the air of somebody who’s experienced a great deal without becoming too cynical, and over time he became the factory worker I knew best.  His vision was broader than most — he had the instinctive curiosity of the self-educated man.  And as a Big Master he often found himself positioned between ownership and labor.  In the city of Shantou, he had helped manage workers as well as machinery, and the experience left a deep impression. \r\n  “I took care of all the registration forms at the factory, and I noticed that many workers couldn’t write,” he said.  “There are still so many uneducated people in China!  But you know, sometimes these people are very smart.  In Shantou I knew a man who worked as an elevator operator at the Blue Sky Hotel.  He hadn’t gone to school, and he couldn’t read or write, but he was naturally intelligent.  Once, the hotel’s generator broke and the electricians couldn’t fix it.  After they failed, the elevator operator said to the boss, ‘Let me look at it.’  The boss said, ‘You don’t understand something like this.’  But finally he let him try and the man fixed it within an hour.  After that, the boss gave him more responsibility, and then another boss hired him for 2,800 yuan per month.  This worker, he was from Sichuan, and he was very honest.  He said, ‘I can’t read or write, how can I make that much money?’  The boss said, ‘I don’t care as long as you understand things.’  Eventually another boss hired him for four thousand.  He basically couldn’t write his name, but he could fix anything.  He couldn’t explain it, but he could do it.” \r\n  In the Shantou suburb called Chaonan, Master Luo made his own rise in the factory world.  During the late 1990s, he found a job at Shangang Keji, one of the early plants to manufacture bra rings.  Master Luo learned to repair the Machine, and by 2002 he earned nearly two hundred dollars every month, an excellent wage.  Meanwhile, other Chaonan bosses heard about the profits from bra rings, and one of them came calling.  Initially the boss didn’t say anything about a job, but he invited Master Luo to dinner at an expensive place called the Peace Restaurant.  “We had crabs, squid, and lobster,” Master Luo remembered.  “And he ordered the kind of beer that’s eighteen yuan per bottle.  They gave me Chunghwa cigarettes.  Afterward we went to a coffee shop and then to karaoke.  We did this three times, and then the boss said, ‘Can you help me?’  He said his current master was bad and he needed somebody who understood the business.” \r\n  Years later, Master Luo could still rattle off intricate details from the times he had been wooed by competing bosses.  He was like a former debutante: he told these stories wistfully, recalling every hotel, every restaurant, even the dishes and the prices.  After the second boss offered to double Master Luo’s salary, he accepted, and soon that company was successful, too.  When the next one came calling, Master Luo’s status had risen, and thus the courtship became more elaborate.  “We went to eat at the Golden Garden Hotel twice,” he said.  “We also went to the Auspicious Garden twice, and then once at the Golden Dragon, and once at the Golden Beautiful City.”  By the time Boss Gao and Boss Wang entered the picture, they represented the fourth bra ring factory to hire Master Luo, and along the way his monthly salary had risen from less than two hundred dollars to more than seven hundred. \r\n  Whenever Master Luo left a company, he followed a set protocol.  He didn’t tell his current boss about the new offer, and he tried to collect any salary that was still owed to him.  Then he asked for a few days’ vacation, explaining that he had to attend to urgent family business in his hometown. "

        "text":"Curious as they may be, Americans tend to be shy when it comes to asking about other people's incomes.  The social costs of appearing nosy are too great for many people to bear.\r\n\r\n Not the case in Sweden.\r\n\r\n The country grants citizens the ability to request anyone else's tax returns with just one phone call.  The only catch: The person whose returns you request will know it was you.\r\n\r\n Sweden's open salary policy reflects how much the country values trust and transparency, which it has cultivated through a strong social welfare model.\r\n\r\n For instance, all citizens receive universal healthcare;  new parents in Sweden receive 480 days of paid parental leave;  and since 2008, the tiny Nordic country has conducted yearly audits of all companies with more than 25 employees to ensure there are no gender pay gaps.\r\n\r\n Sweden's commitment to equality has bred high levels of trust   —   between both individual citizens and between citizens and the government.\r\n\r\n \"It is obvious that openness is significant,\" Stein Reegard, chief economist at the Norwegian Confederation of Trades Unions, told Reuters last year.  \"At least for a better-informed public debate about the different levels of wages in society, whether it's a question of leaders' wages or equal pay.\"\r\n\r\n Until recently, Sweden's government didn't tell people when their returns were being requested.  It was completely anonymous.  Imagine searching for the average salary of a given position on the job review site Glassdoor and instead finding the real salaries of actual employees on the payroll   —   albeit with a little more government bureaucracy involved.\r\n\r\n Unlike the IRS, one of the least-trusted government institutions in America, Sweden's tax agency is among the most-trusted in the country.  Citizens generally believe the department runs fairly and has their best interests in mind.  Transparency helps reinforce that belief: If everyone can know what everyone else makes, politicians and government officials included, it signals the federal agency as a whole has nothing to hide.\r\n\r\n As Reegard pointed out, the added transparency has bled into workplace culture, too.\r\n\r\n In 2008, Sweden passed the Swedish Discrimination Act, a law that requires companies of 25 employees or more to issue yearly surveys asking what people make.  If they discover a gender wage gap and don't make an effort to close it, they'll be forced to pay a fine."

        "text":" said Michael.  'It's rather heavy.  Full of scuba-diving equipment.'\r\n 'Oh, I see,' said Susan, 'oh well, thanks, Nicola, I'll try that fingering.  I'm sure he only put the E flat in there just to annoy people.  Yes, I've been at it solidly all afternoon.  Some of those semiquaver runs in the second movement are absolute bastards.  Well, yes, it helped take my mind off it all.  No, no news.  It's all just mystifying and absolutely horrible.  I don't want even to - look, maybe I'll give you a call again later and see how you're feeling.  I know, yes, you never know which is worse, do you, the illness, the antibiotics, or the doctor's bedside manner.  Look after yourself, or at least, make sure Simon does.  Tell him to bring you gallons of hot lemon.  OK.  Well, I'll talk to you later.  Keep warm.  Bye now.'\r\n She put the phone down and returned to her cello.  She had hardly started to reconsider the problem of the irritating E flat when the phone went again.  She had simply left it off the hook for the afternoon, but had forgotten to do so again after making her own call.\r\n With a sigh she propped up the cello, put down the bow, and went to the phone again.\r\n 'Hello?'  she demanded.\r\n Again, there was nothing, just a distant cry of wind.  Irritably, she slammed the receiver back down once more.\r\n She waited a few seconds for the line to clear, and then was about to take the phone off the hook once more when she realised that perhaps Richard might need her.\r\n She hesitated.\r\n She admitted to herself that she hadn't been using the answering machine, because she usually just put it on for Gordon's convenience, and that was something of which she did not currently wish to be reminded.\r\n Still, she put the answering machine on, turned the volume right down, and returned again to the E flat that Mozart had put in only to annoy cellists.\r\n In the darkness of the offices of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, Gordon Way clumsily fumbled the telephone receiver back on to its rest and sat slumped in the deepest dejection.  He didn't even stop himself slumping all the way through the seat until he rested lightly on the floor.\r\n Miss Pearce had fled the office the first time the telephone had started actually using itself, her patience with all this sort of thing finally exhausted again, since which time Gordon had had the office to himself.  However, his attempts to contact anybody had failed completely.\r\n Or rather, his attempts to contact Susan, which was all he cared about.  It was Susan he had been speaking to when he died and he knew he had somehow to speak to her again.  But she had left her phone off the hook most of the afternoon and even when she had answered she could not hear him.\r\n He gave up.  He roused himself from the floor, stood up, and slipped out and down into the darkening streets.  He drifted aimlessly for a while, went for a walk on the canal, which was a trick that palled very quickly, and then wandered back up to the street again.\r\n The houses with light and life streaming from them upset him most particularly since the welcome they seemed to extend would not be extended to him.  He wondered if anyone would mind if he simply slipped into their house and watched television for the evening.  He wouldn't be any trouble.\r\n Or a cinema.\r\n That would be better, he could go to the cinema.\r\n He turned with more positive, if still insubstantial, footsteps into Noel Road and started to walk up it.\r\n Noel Road, he thought.  It rang a vague bell.  He had a feeling that he had recently had some dealings with someone in Noel Road.  Who was it?\r\n His thoughts were interrupted by a terrible scream of horror that rang through the street.  He stood stock still.  A few seconds later a door flew open a few yards from him and a woman ran out of it, wildeyed and howling.\r\n CHAPTER 31\r\n Richard had never liked Michael Wenton-Weakes and he liked him even less with a ghost in him.  He couldn't say why, he had nothing against ghosts personally, didn't think a person should be judged adversely simply for being dead, but - he didn't like it.\r\n Nevertheless, it was hard not to feel a little sorry for him.\r\n Michael sat forlornly on a stool with his elbow resting on the large table and his head resting on his fingers.  He looked ill and haggard.\r\n He looked deeply tired.  He looked pathetic.  His story had been a harrowing one, and concluded with his attempts to possess first Reg and then Richard.\r\n 'You were,' he concluded, 'right.  Entirely.'\r\n He said this last to Dirk, and Dirk grimaced as if trying not to beam with triumph too many times in a day.\r\n The voice was Michael's and yet it was not Michael's.  Whatever timbre a voice acquires through a billion or so years of dread and isolation, this voice had acquired it, and it filled those who heard it with a dizzying chill akin to that which clutches the mind and stomach when standing on a cliff at night.\r\n He turned his eyes on Reg and on Richard, and the effect of the eyes, too, was one that provoked pity and terror.  Richard had to look away.\r\n 'I owe you both an apology,' said the ghost within Michael 'which I offer you from the depths of my heart, and only hope that as you come to understand the desperation of my predicament, and the hope which this machine offers me, you will understand why I have acted as I have, and that you will find it within yourselves to forgive me.  And to help me.  I beg you.'\r\n 'Give the man a whisky,' said Dirk gruffly.\r\n 'Haven't got any whisky,' said Reg.  'Er, port?  There's a bottle or so of Margaux I could open.  Very fine one.  Should be chambred for an hour, but I can do that of course, it's very easy, I -'\r\n 'Will you help me?'  interrupted the ghost.\r\n Reg bustled to fetch some port and some glasses.\r\n 'Why have you taken over the body of this man?'  said Dirk.\r\n 'I need to have a voice with which to speak and a body with which to act.  No harm will come to him, no harm -'\r\n 'Let me ask the question again.  Why have you taken over the body of this man?'  insisted Dirk.\r\n The ghost made Michael's body shrug.\r\n 'He was willing.  Both of these two gentlemen quite understandably resisted being… well, hypnotised - your analogy is fair.  This one?\r\n Well, I think his sense of self is at a low ebb, and he has acquiesced.\r\n I am very grateful to him and will not do him any harm.'\r\n 'His sense of self,' repeated Dirk thoughtfully, 'is at a low ebb.'\r\n 'I suppose that is probably true,' said Richard quietly to Dirk.  'He seemed very depressed last night.  The one thing that was important to him had been taken away because he, well, he wasn't really very good at it.  Although he's proud I expect he was probably quite receptive to the idea of actually being wanted for something.'\r\n 'Hmmm,' said Dirk, and said it again.  He said it a third time with feeling.  Then he whirled round and barked at the figure on the stool.\r\n 'Michael Wenton-Weakes!'\r\n Michael's head jolted back and he blinked.\r\n 'Yes?'  he said, in his normal lugubrious voice.  His eyes followed Dirk as he moved.\r\n 'You can hear me,' said Dirk, 'and you can answer for yourself?'\r\n 'Oh, yes,' said Michael, 'most certainly I can.'\r\n 'This… being, this spirit.  You know he is in you?  You accept his presence?  You are a willing party to what he wishes to do?'\r\n 'That is correct.  I was much moved by his account of himself, and am very willing to help him.  In fact I think it is right for me to do so.'\r\n 'All right,' said Dirk with a snap of his fingers, 'you can go.'\r\n Michael's head slumped forward suddenly, and then after a second or so it slowly rose again, as if being pumped up from inside like a tyre.\r\n The ghost was back in possession.\r\n Dirk took hold of a chair, spun it round and sat astride it facing the ghost in Michael, peering intently into its eyes.\r\n 'Again,' he said, 'tell me again.  A quick snap account.'\r\n Michael's body tensed slightly.  It reached out to Dirk's arm.\r\n 'Don't - touch me!'  snapped Dirk.  'Just tell me the facts.  The first time you try and make me feel sorry for you I'll poke you in the eye.  Or at least, the one you've borrowed.  So leave out all the stuff that sounded like… er -'\r\n 'Coleridge,' said Richard suddenly, 'it sounded exactly like Coleridge.  It was like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\".  Well bits of it were.'\r\n Dirk frowned.  'Coleridge?'  he said.\r\n 'I tried to tell him my story,' admitted the ghost, 'I -'\r\n 'Sorry,' said Dirk, 'you'll have to excuse me - I've never crossexamined a four-billion-year-old ghost before.  Are we talking Samuel Taylor here?  Are you saying you told your story to Samuel Taylor Coleridge?'\r\n 'I was able to enter his mind at… certain times.  When he was in an impressionable state.'\r\n 'You mean when he was on laudanum?'  said Richard.\r\n 'That is correct.  He was more relaxed then.'\r\n 'I'll say,' snorted Reg, 'I sometimes encountered him when he was quite astoundingly relaxed.  Look, I'll make some coffee.'\r\n He disappeared into the kitchen, where he could be heard laughing to himself.\r\n 'It's another world,' muttered Richard to himself, sitting down and shaking his head.\r\n 'But unfortunately when he was fully in possession of himself I, so to speak, was not,' said the ghost, 'and so that failed.  And what he wrote was very garbled.'\r\n 'Discuss,' said Richard, to himself, raising his eyebrows.\r\n 'Professor,' called out Dirk, 'this may sound absurd.  Did -Coleridge ever try to… er… use your time machine?  Feel free to discuss the question in any way which appeals to you.'\r\n 'Well, do you know,' said Reg, looking round the door, 'he did come in prying around on one occasion, but I think he was in a great deal too relaxed a state to do anything.'\r\n 'I see,' said Dirk.  'But why,' he added turning back to the strange figure of Michael slumped on its stool, 'why has it taken you so long to find someone?'\r\n 'For long, long periods I am very weak, almost totally non-existent, and unable to influence anything at all.  And then, of course, before that time there was no time machine here, and… no hope for me at all -'\r\n 'Perhaps ghosts exist like wave patterns,' suggested Richard, 'like interference patterns between the actual with the possible.  There would be irregular peaks and troughs, like in a musical waveform.'\r\n The ghost snapped Michael's eyes around to Richard.\r\n 'You…' he said, 'you wrote that article…'\r\n 'Er, yes -'\r\n 'It moved me very greatly,' said the ghost, with a sudden remorseful longing in his voice which seemed to catch itself almost as much by surprise as it did its listeners.\r\n 'Oh.  I see,' said Richard, 'Well, thank you.  You didn't like it so much last time you mentioned it.  Well, I know that wasn't you as such - -'\r\n Richard sat back frowning to himself.\r\n 'So,' said Dirk, 'to return to the beginning -'\r\n The ghost gathered Michael's breath for him and started again.  'We were on a ship -' it said.\r\n 'A spaceship.'\r\n 'Yes.  Out from Salaxala, a world in… well, very far from here.  A violent and troubled place.  We - a party of some nine dozen of us -set out, as people frequently did, to find a new world for ourselves.\r\n All the planets in this system were completely unsuitable for our purpose, but we stopped on this world to replenish some necessary mineral supplies.\r\n 'Unfortunately our landing ship was damaged on its way into the atmosphere.  Damaged quite badly, but still quite reparable.\r\n 'I was the engineer on board and it fell to me to supervise the task of repairing the ship and preparing it to return to our main ship.  Now, in order to understand what happened next you must know something of the nature of a highly-automated society.  There is no task that cannot be done more easily with the aid of advanced computerisation.  And there were some very specific problems associated with a trip with an aim such as ours -'\r\n 'Which was?'  said Dirk sharply.\r\n The ghost in Michael blinked as if the answer was obvious.\r\n 'Well, to find a new and better world on which we could all live in freedom, peace and harmony forever, of course,' he said.\r\n Dirk raised his eyebrows.\r\n 'Oh, that,' he said.  'You'd thought this all out carefully, I assume.'\r\n 'We'd had it thought out for us.  We had with us some very specialised devices for helping us to continue to believe in the purpose of the trip even when things got difficult.  They generally worked very well, but I think we probably came to rely on them too much.'\r\n 'What on earth were they?'  said Dirk.\r\n 'It's probably hard for you to understand how reassuring they were.\r\n And that was why I made my fatal mistake.  When I wanted to know whether or not it was safe to take off, I didn't want to know that it might /not/ be safe.  I just wanted to be reassured that it /was/.  So instead of checking it myself, you see, I sent out one of the Electric Monks.'\r\n CHAPTER 32\r\n The brass plaque on the red door in Peckender Street glittered as it reflected the yellow light of a street lamp.  It glared for a moment as it reflected the violent flashing light of a passing police car sweeping by.\r\n It dimmed slightly as a pale, pale wraith slipped silently through it.  It glimmered as it dimmed, because the wraith was trembling with such terrible agitation.\r\n In the dark hallway the ghost of Gordon Way paused.  He needed something to lean on for support, and of course there was nothing.  He tried to get a grip on himself, but there was nothing to get a grip on.\r\n He retched at the horror of what he had seen, but there was, of course, nothing in his stomach.  He half stumbled, half swam up the stairs, like a drowning man trying to grapple for a grip on the water.\r\n He staggered through the wall, through the desk, through the door, and tried to compose and settle himself in front of the desk in Dirk's office.\r\n If anyone had happened into the office a few minutes later - a night cleaner perhaps, if Dirk Gently had ever employed one, which he didn't on the grounds that they wished to be paid and he did not wish to pay them, or a burglar, perhaps, if there had been anything in the office worth burgling, which there wasn't - they would have seen the following sight and been amazed by it.\r\n The receiver of the large red telephone on the desk suddenly rocked and tumbled off its rest on to the desk top.\r\n A dialling tone started to burr.

        "text":"1.1 What is the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge?\r\n\r\n A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide) is a globally\r\n\r\n recognized standard for the practice of business analysis.  The BABOK® Guide describes\r\n\r\n business analysis areas of knowledge, their associated activities and tasks, and the skills\r\n\r\n necessary to be effective in their execution.\r\n\r\n The primary purpose of the BABOK® Guide is to define the profession of business analysis.\r\n\r\n It serves as a baseline that practitioners can agree upon in order to discuss the work they\r\n\r\n do and to ensure that they have the skills they need to effectively perform the role, and\r\n\r\n defines the skills and knowledge that people who work with and employ business analysts\r\n\r\n should expect a skilled practitioner to demonstrate.  It is a framework that describes the\r\n\r\n business analysis tasks that must be performed in order to understand how a solution\r\n\r\n will deliver value to the sponsoring organization.  The form those tasks take, the order\r\n\r\n they are performed in, the relative importance of the tasks, and other things may vary,\r\n\r\nbut each task contributes in some fashion, directly or indirectly, to that overall goal.\r\n\r\n This chapter provides an introduction to key concepts in the field of business analysis\r\n\r\n and describes the structure of the remainder of the BABOK® Guide.  Chapters 2 through\r\n\r\n 7 define the tasks that a business analyst must be capable of performing.  Chapter 8\r\n\r\n describes the competencies that support the effective performance of business analysis,\r\n\r\nand Chapter 9 describes a number of generally accepted techniques that support the\r\n\r\n practice of business analysis.\r\n\r\n 1.2 What is Business Analysis?\r\n\r\n Business analysis is the set of tasks and techniques used to work as a liaison among\r\n\r\n stakeholders in order to understand the structure, policies, and operations of an\r\n\r\n organization, and to recommend solutions that enable the organization to achieve its\r\n\r\n goals.\r\n\r\n Business analysis involves understanding how organizations function to accomplish\r\n\r\n their purposes, and defining the capabilities an organization requires to provide products\r\n\r\n and services to external stakeholders.  It includes the definition of organizational goals,\r\n\r\nhow those goals connect to specific objectives, determining the courses of action that\r\n\r\n an organization has to undertake to achieve those goals and objectives, and defining\r\n\r\n how the various organizational units and stakeholders within and outside of that\r\n\r\n organization interact.\r\n\r\n Business analysis may be performed to understand the current state of an organization or\r\n\r\n to serve as a basis for the later identification of business needs.  In most cases, however,\r\n\r\nbusiness analysis is performed to define and validate solutions that meet business needs,\r\n\r\ngoals, or objectives.\r\n\r\n Business analysts must analyze and synthesize information provided by a large number\r\n\r\n of people who interact with the business, such as customers, staff, IT professionals,\r\n\r\nand executives.  The business analyst is responsible for eliciting the actual needs of\r\n\r\n stakeholders, not simply their expressed desires.  In many cases, the business analyst will also work to facilitate communication between organizational units.  In particular,\r\n\r\nbusiness analysts often play a central role in aligning the needs of business units with\r\n\r\n the capabilities delivered by information technology, and may serve as a “translator”\r\n\r\n between those groups.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Then, one by one, seven of the large, easily pushed buttons depressed themselves, and after the very long pause which the British telephone system allows you within which to gather your thoughts and forget who it is you're phoning, the sound of a phone ringing at the other end of the line could be heard.\r\n After a couple of rings there was a click, a whirr, and a sound as of a machine drawing breath.  Then a voice started to say, 'Hello, this is Susan.  I can't come to the phone right at the moment because I'm trying to get an E flat right, but if you'd like to leave your name…'\r\n 'So then, on the say so of an - I can hardly bring myself to utter the words - Electric Monk,' said Dirk in a voice ringing with derision, 'you attempt to launch the ship and to your utter astonishment it explodes.  Since when -?'\r\n 'Since when,' said the ghost, abjectly, 'I have been alone on this planet.  Alone with the knowledge of what I had done to my fellows on the ship.  All, all alone…'\r\n 'Yes, skip that, I said,' snapped Dirk angrily.  'What about the main ship?  That presumably went on and continued its search for -'\r\n 'No.'\r\n 'Then what happened to it?'\r\n 'Nothing.  It's still there.'\r\n 'Still /there/?'\r\n Dirk leapt to his feet and whirled off to pace the room, his brow furiously furrowed.\r\n 'Yes.'  Michael's head drooped a little, but he looked up pitieously at Reg and at Richard.  'All of us were aboard the landing craft.  At first I felt myself to be haunted by the ghosts of the rest, but it was only in my imagination.  For millions of years, and then billions, I stalked the mud utterly alone.  It is impossible for you to conceive of even the tiniest part of the torment of such eternity.  Then,' he added, 'just recently life arose on the planet.  Life.  Vegetation, things in the sea, then, at last, you.  Intelligent life.  I turn to you to release me from the torment I have endured.'\r\n Michael's head sank abjectly on to his chest for some few seconds.\r\n Then slowly, wobblingly, it rose and stared at them again, with yet darker fires in his eyes.\r\n 'Take me back,' he said, 'I beg you, take me back to the landing craft.  Let me undo what was done.  A word from me, and it can be undone, the repairs properly made, the landing craft can then return to the main ship, we can be on our way, my torment will be extinguished, and I will cease to be a burden to you.  I beg you.'\r\n There was a short silence while his plea hung in the air.\r\n 'But that can't work, can it?'  said Richard.  'If we do that, then this won't have happened.  Don't we generate all sorts of paradoxes?'\r\n Reg stirred himself from thought.  'No worse than many that exist already,' he said.  'If the Universe came to an end every time there was some uncertainty about what had happened in it, it would never have got beyond the first picosecond.  And many of course don't.  It's like a human body, you see.  A few cuts and bruises here and there don't hurt it.  Not even major surgery if it's done properly.  Paradoxes are just the scar tissue.  Time and space heal themselves up around them and people simply remember a version of events which makes as much sense as they require it to make.\r\n 'That isn't to say that if you get involved in a paradox a few things won't strike you as being very odd, but if you've got through life without that already happening to you, then I don't know which Universe you've been living in, but it isn't this one.'\r\n 'Well, if that's the case,' said Richard, 'why were you so fierce about not doing anything to save the dodo?'\r\n Reg sighed.  'You don't understand at all.  The dodo wouldn't have died if I hadn't worked so hard to save the coelacanth.'\r\n 'The coelacanth?  The prehistoric fish?  But how could one possibly affect the other?'\r\n 'Ah.  Now there you're asking.  The complexities of cause and effect defy analysis.  Not only is the continuum like a human body, it is also very like a piece of badly put up wallpaper.  Push down a bubble somewhere, another one pops up somewhere else.  There are no more dodos because of my interference.  In the end I imposed the rule on myself because I simply couldn't bear it any more.  The only thing that really gets hurt when you try and change time is yourself.'  He smiled bleakly, and looked away.\r\n Then he added, after a long moment's reflection, 'No, it can be done.  I'm just cynical because it's gone wrong so many times.  This poor fellow's story is a very pathetic one, and it can do no harm to put an end to his misery.  It happened so very, very long ago on a dead planet.\r\n If we do this we will each remember whatever it is that has happened to us individually.  Too bad if the rest of the world doesn't quite agree.\r\n It will hardly be the first time.'\r\n Michael's head bowed.\r\n 'You're very silent, Dirk,' said Richard.\r\n Dirk glared angrily at him.  ' I want to see this ship,' he demanded.\r\n In the darkness, the red telephone receiver slipped and slid fitfully back across the desk.  If anybody had been there to see it they might just have discerned a shape that moved it.\r\n It shone only very faintly, less than would the hands of a luminous watch.  It seemed more as if the darkness around it was just that much darker and the ghostly shape sat within it like thickened scar tissue beneath the surface of the night.\r\n Gordon grappled one last time with the recalcitrant receiver.  At length he got a final grip and slipped it up on to the top of the instrument.\r\n From there it fell back on to its rest and disconnected the call.  At the same moment the ghost of Gordon Way, his last call finally completed, fell back to his own rest and vanished.\r\n CHAPTER 33 \r\n Swinging slowly round in the shadow of the Earth, just one more piece of debris among that which floated now forever in high orbit, was one dark shape that was larger and more regularly formed than the rest.\r\n And far, far older.\r\n For four billion years it had continued to absorb data from the world below it, scanning, analysing, processing.  Occasionally it sent pieces back if it thought they would help, if it thought they might be received.  But otherwise, it watched, it listened, it recorded.  Not the lapping of a wave nor the beating of a heart escaped its attention.\r\n Otherwise, nothing inside it had moved for four billion years, except for the air which circulated still, and the motes of dust within the air that danced and danced and danced and danced… and danced.\r\n It was only a very slight disturbance that occurred now.  Quietly, without fuss, like a dew drop precipitating from the air on to a leaf, there appeared in a wall which had stood blank and grey for four billion years, a door.  A plain, ordinary white-panelled door with a small dented brass handle.\r\n This quiet event, too, was recorded and incorporated in the continual stream of data processing that the ship ceaselessly performed.  Not only the arrival of the door, but the arrival of those behind the door, the way they looked, the way they moved, the way they felt about being there.  All processed, all recorded, all transformed.\r\n After a moment or two had passed, the door opened.\r\n Within it could be seen a room unlike any on the ship.  A room of wooden floors, of shabby upholstery, a room in which a fire danced.  And as the fire danced, its data danced within the ship's computers, and the motes of dust in the air also danced with it.\r\n A figure stood in the doorway - a large lugubrious figure with a strange light that danced now in its eyes.  It stepped forward across the threshold into the ship, and its face was suddenly suffused with a calm for which it had longed but had thought never again to experience.\r\n Following him stepped out a smaller, older man with hair that was white and wayward.  He stopped and blinked with wonder as he passed from out of the realm of his room and into the realm of the ship.  Following him came a third man, impatient and tense, with a large leather overcoat that flapped about him.  He, too, stopped and was momentarily bewildered by something he didn't understand.  With a look of deepest puzzlement on his face he walked forward and looked around at the grey and dusty walls of the ancient ship.\r\n At last came a fourth man, tall and thin.  He stooped as he walked out of the door, and then instantly stopped as if he had walked into a wall.\r\n He had walked into a wall, of a kind.\r\n He stood transfixed.  If anyone had been looking at his face at that moment, it would have been abundantly clear to them that the single most astonishing event of this man's entire existence was currently happening to him.\r\n When slowly he began to move it was with a curious gait, as if he was swimming very slowly.  Each tiniest movement of his head seemed to bring fresh floods of awe and astonishment into his face.  Tears welled in his eyes, and he became breathless with gasping wonder.\r\n Dirk turned to look at him, to hurry him along.\r\n 'What's the matter?'  he called above the noise.\r\n 'The… music…' whispered Richard.\r\n The air was full of music.  So full it seemed there was room for nothing else.  And each particle of air seemed to have its own music, so that as Richard moved his head he heard a new and different music, though the new and different music fitted quite perfectly with the music that lay beside it in the air.\r\n The modulations from one to another were perfectly accomplished -astonishing leaps to distant keys made effortlessly in the mere shifting of the head.  New themes, new strands of melody, all perfectly and astoundingly proportioned, constantly involved themselves into the continuing web.  Huge slow waves of movement, faster dances that thrilled through them, tiny scintillating scampers that danced on the dances, long tangled tunes whose ends were so like their beginnings that they twisted around upon themselves, turned inside out, upside down, and then rushed off again on the back of yet another dancing melody in a distant part of the ship.\r\n Richard staggered against the wall.\r\n Dirk hurried to grab him.\r\n 'Come on,' he said, brusquely, 'what's the matter?  Can't you stand the music?  It's a bit loud, isn't it?  For God's sake, pull yourself together.  There's something here I still don't understand.  It's not right.  Come on -'\r\n He tugged Richard after him, and then had to support him as Richard's mind sank further and further under the overwhelming weight of music.  The visions that were woven in his mind by the million thrilling threads of music as they were pulled through it, were increasingly a welter of chaos, but the more the chaos burgeoned the more it fitted with the other chaos, and the next greater chaos, until it all became a vast exploding ball of harmony expanding in his mind faster than any mind could deal with.\r\n And then it was all much simpler.\r\n A single tune danced through his mind and all his attention rested upon it.  It was a tune that seethed through the magical flood, shaped it, formed it, lived through it hugely, lived through it minutely, was its very essence.  It bounced and trilled along, at first a little tripping tune, then it slowed, then it danced again but with more difficulty, seemed to founder in eddies of doubt and confusion, and then suddenly revealed that the eddies were just the first ripples of a huge new wave of energy surging up joyfully from beneath.\r\n Richard began very, very slowly to faint.\r\n He lay very still.\r\n He felt he was an old sponge steeped in paraffin and left in the sun to dry.\r\n He felt like the body of an old horse burning hazily in the sun.  He dreamed of oil, thin and fragrant, of dark heaving seas.  He was on a white beach, drunk with fish, stupefied with sand, bleached, drowsing, pummelled with light, sinking, estimating the density of vapour clouds in distant nebulae, spinning with dead delight.  He was a pump spouting fresh water in the springtime, gushing into a mound of reeking newmown grass.  Sounds, almost unheard, burned away like distant sleep.\r\n He ran and was falling.  The lights of a harbour spun into night.  The sea like a dark spirit slapped infinitesimally at the sand, glimmering, unconscious.  Out where it was deeper and colder he sank easily with the heavy sea swelling like oil around his ears, and was disturbed only by a distant burr burr as of the phone ringing.\r\n He knew he had been listening to the music of life itself.  The music of light dancing on water that rippled with the wind and the tides, of the life that moved through the water, of the life that moved on the land, warmed by the light.\r\n He continued to lie very still.  He continued to be disturbed by a distant burr burr as of a phone ringing.\r\n Gradually he became aware that the distant burr burr as of a phone ringing was a phone ringing.\r\n He sat up sharply.\r\n He was lying on a small crumpled bed in a small untidy panelled room that he knew he recognised but couldn't place.  It was cluttered with books and shoes.  He blinked at it and was blank.\r\n The phone by the bed was ringing.  He picked it up.\r\n 'Hello?'  he said.\r\n 'Richard!'  It was Susan's voice, utterly distraught.  He shook his head and had no recollection of anything useful.\r\n 'Hello?'  he said again.\r\n 'Richard, is that you?  /Where are you? /'\r\n 'Er, hold on, I'll go and look.'\r\n He put the receiver down on the crumpled sheets, where it lay squawking, climbed shakily off the bed, staggered to the door and opened it.\r\n Here was a bathroom.  He peered at it suspiciously.  Again, he recognised it but felt that there was something missing.  Oh yes.  There should be a horse in it.  Or at least, there had been a horse in it the last time he had seen it.  He crossed the bathroom floor and went out of the other door.  He found his way shakily down the stairs and into Reg's main room.\r\n He was surprised by what he saw when he got there.\r\n CHAPTER 34\r\n The storms of the day before, and of the day before that, and the floods of the previous week, had now abated.

        "text":"A business analyst is any person who performs business analysis activities, no matter\r\n\r\n what their job title or organizational role may be.  Business analysis practitioners include\r\n\r\n not only people with the job title of business analyst, but may also include business\r\n\r\n systems analysts, systems analysts, requirements engineers, process analysts, product\r\n\r\n managers, product owners, enterprise analysts, business architects, management\r\n\r\n consultants, or any other person who performs the tasks described in the BABOK® Guide,\r\n\r\nincluding those who also perform related disciplines such as project management,\r\n\r\nsoftware development, quality assurance, and interaction design.\r\n\r\n 1.3 Key Concepts\r\n\r\n 1.3.1 Domains\r\n\r\n A domain is the area undergoing analysis.  It may correspond to the boundaries of an\r\n\r\n organization or organizational unit, as well as key stakeholders outside those boundaries\r\n\r\n and interactions with those stakeholders.\r\n\r\n 1.3.2  Solutions\r\n\r\n A solution is a set of changes to the current state of an organization that are made in order\r\n\r\n to enable that organization to meet a business need, solve a problem, or take advantage\r\n\r\n of an opportunity.  The scope of the solution is usually narrower than the scope of the\r\n\r\n domain within which it is implemented, and will serve as the basis for the scope of a\r\n\r\n project to implement that solution or its components.\r\n\r\n Most solutions are a system of interacting solution components, each of which are\r\n\r\n potentially solutions in their own right.  Examples of solutions and solution components\r\n\r\n include software applications, web services, business processes, the business rules that\r\n\r\n govern that process, an information technology application, a revised organizational\r\n\r\n structure, outsourcing, insourcing, redefining job roles, or any other method of creating\r\n\r\n a capability needed by an organization.\r\n\r\n Business analysis helps organizations define the optimal solution for their needs, given\r\n\r\n the set of constraints (including time, budget, regulations, and others) under which that\r\n\r\n organization operates.\r\n\r\n 1.3.3  Requirements\r\n\r\n A requirement\r\n\r\n is:\r\n\r\n1.  A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an\r\n\r\n objective.\r\n\r\n 2.  A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution\r\n\r\n component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed\r\n\r\n documents.\r\n 3.  A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2).\r\n\r\n As implied by this definition, a requirement may be unstated, implied by or derived\r\n\r\n from other requirements, or directly stated and managed.  One of the key objectives of\r\n\r\n business analysis is to ensure that requirements are visible to and understood by all\r\n\r\n stakeholders.\r\n\r\n The term “requirement” is one that generates a lot of discussion within the business\r\n\r\n analysis community.  Many of these debates focus on what should or should not be\r\n\r\n considered a requirement, and what are the necessary characteristics of a requirement.\r\n\r\n When reading the BABOK® Guide, however, it is vital that “requirement” be understood in\r\n\r\n the broadest possible sense.  Requirements include, but are not limited to, past, present,\r\n\r\nand future conditions or capabilities in an enterprise and descriptions of organizational\r\n\r\n structures, roles, processes, policies, rules, and information systems.  A requirement may\r\n\r\n describe the current or the future state of any aspect of the enterprise.\r\n\r\n Much of the existing literature on business analysis is written with the assumption that\r\n\r\n requirements only describe an information technology system that is being considered\r\n\r\n for implementation.  Other definitions may include future state business functions as\r\n\r\n well, or restrict the meaning of the term to define the ends stakeholders are seeking to\r\n\r\n achieve and not the means by which those ends are achieved.  While all of these different\r\n\r\n uses of the term are reasonable and defensible, and the BABOK® Guide’s usage of the term\r\n\r\n includes those meanings, they are significantly narrower than the way the term is used\r\n\r\n here.\r\n\r\n Similarly, we do not assume that requirements are analyzed at any particular level\r\n\r\n of detail, other than to say that they should be assessed to whatever level of depth is\r\n\r\n necessary for understanding and action.  In the context of a Business Process Management\r\n\r\n initiative, the requirements may be a description of the business processes currently in\r\n\r\n use in an organization.  On other projects, the business analyst may choose to develop\r\n\r\n requirements to describe the current state of the enterprise (which is in itself a solution\r\n\r\n to existing or past business needs) before investigating changes to that solution needed\r\n\r\n to meet changing business conditions.\r\n\r\n .1 Requirements Classification Scheme\r\n\r\n For the purposes of the BABOK® Guide, the following classification scheme is used to\r\n\r\n describe requirements:\r\n\r\n▶ Business Requirements are higher-level statements of the goals, objectives, or\r\n\r\n needs of the enterprise.  They describe the reasons why a project has been initiated,\r\n\r\nthe objectives that the project will achieve, and the metrics that will be used to\r\n\r\n measure its success.  Business requirements describe needs of the organization as\r\n\r\n a whole, and not groups or stakeholders within it.  They are developed and defined\r\n\r\n through enterprise analysis.\r\n\r\n ▶ Stakeholder Requirements are statements of the needs of a particular stakeholder\r\n\r\n or class of stakeholders.  They describe the needs that a given stakeholder has and\r\n\r\n how that stakeholder will interact with a solution.  Stakeholder requirements serve\r\n\r\n as a bridge between business requirements and the various classes of solution\r\n\r\n requirements.  They are developed and defined through requirements analysis.\r\n Solution Requirements describe the characteristics of a solution that meet business\r\n\r\n requirements and stakeholder requirements.  They are developed and defined through\r\n\r\n requirements analysis.  They are frequently divided into sub-categories, particularly\r\n\r\n when the requirements describe a software solution:\r\n\r\n▷ Functional Requirements describe the behavior and information that the\r\n\r\n solution will manage.  They describe capabilities the system will be able to\r\n\r\n perform in terms of behaviors or operations — specific information technology\r\n\r\n application actions or responses.\r\n\r\n ▷ Non-functional Requirements capture conditions that do not directly relate to\r\n\r\n the behavior or functionality of the solution, but rather describe environmental\r\n\r\n conditions under which the solution must remain effective or qualities that\r\n\r\n the systems must have.  They are also known as quality or supplementary\r\n\r\n requirements.  These can include requirements related to capacity, speed,\r\n\r\nsecurity, availability and the information architecture and presentation of the\r\n\r\n user interface.\r\n\r\n ▶ Transition Requirements describe capabilities that the solution must have in\r\n\r\n order to facilitate transition from the current state of the enterprise to a desired\r\n\r\n future state, but that will not be needed once that transition is complete.  They are\r\n\r\n differentiated from other requirements types because they are always temporary in\r\n\r\n nature and because they cannot be developed until both an existing and new solution\r\n\r\n are defined.  They typically cover data conversion from existing systems, skill gaps\r\n\r\n that must be addressed, and other related changes to reach the desired future state.\r\n\r\n They are developed and defined through solution assessment and validation.\r\n\r\n 1.4 Knowledge Areas\r\n\r\n Knowledge areas define what a practitioner of business analysis needs to understand\r\n\r\n and the tasks a practitioner must be able to perform.\r\n\r\n Business analysts are likely to perform tasks from all knowledge areas in rapid\r\n\r\n succession, iteratively, or simultaneously.  Tasks may be performed in any order as long\r\n\r\n as the required inputs are available.  In principle, a business analysis effort may start with\r\n\r\n any task, although the most likely candidates are Define Business Need (5.1) or Evaluate\r\n\r\n Solution Performance (7.6).\r\n\r\n Knowledge areas are not intended to represent phases in a project.  It is certainly\r\n\r\n possible and permissible to proceed from performing enterprise analysis activities, to\r\n\r\n requirements analysis activities, to solution assessment and validation activities, and\r\n\r\n treat each as a distinct phase in a project.  However, the BABOK® Guide does not require\r\n\r\n that you do so, and it should not be construed as a methodology for the performance of\r\n\r\n business analysis.\r\n\r\n Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring (Chapter 2) is the knowledge area that\r\n\r\n covers how business analysts determine which activities are necessary in order to\r\n\r\n complete a business analysis effort.  It covers identification of stakeholders, selection\r\n\r\n of business analysis techniques, the process that will be used to manage requirements,\r\n\r\nand how to assess the progress of the work.  The tasks in this knowledge area govern the\r\n\r\n performance of all other business analysis tasks.\r\n Elicitation (Chapter 3) describes how business analysts work with stakeholders to\r\n\r\n identify and understand their needs and concerns, and understand the environment\r\n\r\n in which they work.  The purpose of elicitation is to ensure that a stakeholder’s actual\r\n\r\n underlying needs are understood, rather than their stated or superficial desires.\r\n\r\n Requirements Management and Communication (Chapter 4) describes how business\r\n\r\n analysts manage conflicts, issues and changes in order to ensure that stakeholders and\r\n\r\n the project team remain in agreement on the solution scope, how requirements are\r\n\r\n communicated to stakeholders, and how knowledge gained by the business analyst is\r\n\r\n maintained for future use.\r\n\r\n Enterprise Analysis (Chapter 5) describes how business analysts identify a business\r\n\r\n need, refine and clarify the definition of that need, and define a solution scope that\r\n\r\n can feasibly be implemented by the business.  This knowledge area describes problem\r\n\r\n definition and analysis, business case development, feasibility studies, and the definition\r\n\r\n of solution scope.\r\n\r\n Requirements Analysis (Chapter 6) describes how business analysts prioritize and\r\n\r\n progressively elaborate stakeholder and solution requirements in order to enable\r\n\r\n the project team to implement a solution that will meet the needs of the sponsoring\r\n\r\n organization and stakeholders.  It involves analyzing stakeholder needs to define\r\n\r\n solutions that meet those needs, assessing the current state of the business to identify\r\n\r\n and recommend improvements, and the verification and validation of the resulting\r\n\r\n requirements.\r\n Solution Assessment and Validation (Chapter 7) describes how business analysts assess\r\n\r\n proposed solutions to determine which solution best fits the business need, identify gaps\r\n\r\n and shortcomings in solutions, and determine necessary workarounds or changes to\r\n\r\n the solution.  It also describes how business analysts assess deployed solutions to see\r\n\r\n how well they met the original need so that the sponsoring organization can assess the\r\n\r\n performance and effectiveness of the solution.\r\n\r\n Underlying Competencies (Chapter 8) describes the behaviors, knowledge, and other\r\n\r\n characteristics that support the effective performance of business analysis.\r\n\r\n 1.5 Tasks\r\n\r\n Each knowledge area describes the tasks performed by business analysts to accomplish\r\n\r\n the purpose of that knowledge area.  Each task in the BABOK® Guide is presented in the\r\n\r\n following format:\r\n\r\n1.5.1 Purpose\r\n\r\n Each task has a purpose.  The purpose is a short description of the reason for a business\r\n\r\n analyst to perform the task and the value created through performing the task.\r\n\r\n 1.5.2  Description\r\n\r\n A task is an essential piece of work that must be performed as part of business analysis.\r\n\r\n Each task should be performed at least once during the vast majority of business\r\n\r\n analysis initiatives, but there is no upper limit to the number of times any task may be\r\n\r\n performed.\r\n\r\n Tasks may be performed at any scale.  Each task may be performed over periods ranging\r\n\r\n from several months in time to a few minutes.  For example, a business case may be a\r\n\r\n document several hundred pages long, justifying a multi-billion dollar investment, or a\r\n\r\n single sentence explaining the benefit that a change will produce for a single individual.\r\n\r\n A task has the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n▶ A task accomplishes a result in an output that creates value to the sponsoring\r\n\r\n organization — that is, if a task is performed it should produce some demonstrable\r\n\r\n positive outcome which is useful, specific, visible and measurable.\r\n\r\n ▶ A task is complete — in principle, successor tasks that make use of outputs should be\r\n\r\n able to be performed by a different person or group.\r\n\r\n ▶ A task is a necessary part of the purpose of the Knowledge Area with which it is\r\n\r\n associated.\r\n\r\n The BABOK® Guide does not prescribe a process or an order in which tasks are performed.\r\n\r\n Some ordering of tasks is inevitable, as certain tasks produce outputs that are required\r\n\r\n inputs for other tasks.  However, it is important to keep in mind that the BABOK® Guide\r\n\r\n only prescribes that the input must exist.  The input may be incomplete or subject to\r\n\r\n change and revision, which may cause the task to be performed multiple times.  Iterative\r\n\r\n or agile lifecycles may require that tasks in all knowledge areas be performed in parallel,\r\n\r\nand lifecycles with clearly defined phases will still require tasks from multiple knowledge\r\n\r\n areas to be performed in every phase.  Tasks may be performed in any order, as long as the necessary inputs to a task are present.\r\n\r\n The description of a task explains in greater detail why the task is performed, what the\r\n\r\n task is, and the results the task should accomplish.\r\n\r\n 1.5.3  Input\r\n\r\n An input represents the information and preconditions necessary for a task to begin.\r\n\r\n Inputs may be:\r\n\r\n▶ Explicitly generated outside the scope of business analysis (e.g., construction of a\r\n\r\n software application).\r\n\r\n ▶ Generated by a business analysis task.\r\n\r\n There is no assumption that the presence of an input or an output means that the\r\n\r\n associated deliverable is complete or in its final state.  The input only needs to be\r\n\r\n sufficiently complete to allow successive work to begin.  Any number of instances of an\r\n\r\n input may exist during the lifecycle of an initiative.\r\n Requirements are a special case as an input or output, which should not be surprising\r\n\r\n given their importance to business analysis.  They are the only input or output that is not\r\n\r\n produced by a single task.  Requirements can be classified in a number of different ways\r\n\r\n and exist in any of a number of different states.  When listed as an input or output in this\r\n\r\n section of the task, the following format will be used to indicate the classification and\r\n\r\n state of a requirement or set of requirements:\r\n\r\nClassification Requirements [State or States].  If no classification or states are listed,\r\n\r\nany or all requirements may be used as an input or output.  For example, Requirements\r\n\r\n [Stated] means that the requirement may have any classification, whereas Business Requirements would mean that the business requirements may be in any possible state\r\n\r\n (e.g.  verified, prioritized, stated, or combinations thereof).\r\n\r\n States may also be combined in some cases.  For example, Requirements [Prioritized\r\n\r\n and Verified] should be read to indicate that the requirements have been both prioritized\r\n\r\n and verified.  Requirements [Prioritized or Verified] means that the requirements may\r\n\r\n be prioritized, verified, or both.\r\n\r\n In general text, the state will be written first, followed by the classification (e.g.  stated\r\n\r\n requirements, verified business requirements, etc.) Again, if no state or classification\r\n\r\n is indicated, it means that the requirement is not restricted to any particular state or\r\n\r\n classification.\r\n\r\n 1.5.4  Elements\r\n\r\n The format and structure of this section is unique to each task.  The elements section\r\n\r\n describes key concepts that are needed to understand how to perform the task.\r\n\r\n 1.5.5 Techniques\r\n\r\n Each task contains a listing of relevant techniques.  Some techniques are specific to the\r\n\r\n performance of a single task, while others are relevant to the performance of a large\r\n\r\n number of tasks (and are listed in Chapter 9: Techniques).  If a particular task can use\r\n\r\n both kinds of techniques, the ones found in Chapter 9 will be listed under a “General\r\n\r\n Techniques” subsection.  If there are no subsections, then all techniques may be found in\r\n\r\n Chapter 9.  For additional information, see Techniques (1.6).\r\n\r\n 1.5.6 Stakeholders\r\n\r\n Each task includes a listing of generic stakeholders who are likely to participate in the\r\n\r\n execution of that task or who will be affected by it.  A generic stakeholder represents a\r\n\r\n class of people that the business analyst is likely to interact with in a specific way.  The\r\n\r\n BABOK® Guide does not mandate that these roles be filled for any given initiative.  Any\r\n\r\n stakeholder can be a source of requirements, assumptions, or constraints.\r\n\r\n This list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all possible stakeholder classifications,\r\n\r\nas it would simply not be possible to compile such a listing.  Some additional examples of\r\n\r\n people who fit into each of these generic roles are provided in Figure 1–3. "

        "text":"The skies still bulged with rain, but all that actually fell in the gathering evening gloom was a dreary kind of prickle.\r\n Some wind whipped across the darkening plain, blundered through the low hills and gusted across a shallow valley where stood a structure, a kind of tower, alone in a nightmare of mud, and leaning.\r\n It was a blackened stump of a tower.  It stood like an extrusion of magma from one of the more pestilential pits of hell, and it leaned at a peculiar angle, as if oppressed by something altogether more terrible than its own considerable weight.  It seemed a dead thing, long ages dead.\r\n The only movement was that of a river of mud that moved sluggishly along the bottom of the valley past the tower.  A mile or so further on, the river ran down a ravine and disappeared underground.\r\n But as the evening darkened it became apparent that the tower was not entirely without life.  There was a single dim red light guttering deep within it.\r\n It was this scene that Richard was surprised to see from a small white doorway set in the side of the valley wall, a few hundred yards from the tower.\r\n 'Don't step out!'  said Dirk, putting up an arm, 'The atmosphere is poisonous.  I'm not sure what's in it but it would certainly get your carpets nice and clean.'\r\n Dirk was standing in the doorway watching the valley with deep mistrust.\r\n 'Where are we?'  asked Richard.\r\n 'Bermuda,' said Dirk.  'It's a bit complicated.'\r\n 'Thank you,' said Richard and walked groggily back across the room.\r\n 'Excuse me,' he said to Reg, who was busy fussing round Michael Wenton-Weakes, making sure that the scuba diving suit he was wearing fitted snuggly everywhere, that the mask was secure and that the regulator for the air supply was working properly.\r\n 'Sorry, can I just get past?'  said Richard.  'Thanks.'\r\n He climbed back up the stairs, went back into Reg's bedroom, sat shakily on the edge of the bed and picked up the phone again.\r\n 'Bermuda,' he said, 'it's a bit complicated.'\r\n Downstairs, Reg finished smearing Vaseline on all the joins of the suit and the few pieces of exposed skin around the mask, and then announced that all was ready.\r\n Dirk swung himself away from the door and stood aside with the utmost bad grace.\r\n 'Well then,' he said, 'be off with you.  Good riddance.  I wash my hands of the whole affair.  I suppose we will have to wait here for you to send back the empty, for what it's worth.'  He stalked round the sofa with an angry gesture.  He didn't like this.  He didn't like any of it.\r\n He particularly didn't like Reg knowing more about space\\time than he did.  It made him angry that he didn't know why he didn't like it.\r\n 'My dear fellow,' said Reg in a conciliatory tone, 'consider what a very small effort it is for us to help the poor soul.  I'm sorry if it seems to you an anti-climax after all your extraordinary feats of deduction.  I know you feel that a mere errand of mercy seems not enough for you, but you should be more charitable.'\r\n 'Charitable, ha!'  said Dirk. ' I pay my taxes, what more do you want?'\r\n He threw himself on to the sofa, ran his hands through his hair and sulked.\r\n The possessed figure of Michael shook hands with Reg and said a few words of thanks.  Then he walked stiffly to the door, turned and bowed to them both.\r\n Dirk flung his head round and glared at him, his eyes flashing behind their spectacles and his hair flying wildly.  The ghost looked at Dirk, and for a moment shivered inside with apprehension.  A superstitious instinct suddenly made the ghost wave.  He waved Michael's hand round in a circle, three times, and then said a single word.\r\n 'Goodbye,' he said.\r\n With that he turned again, gripped the sides of the doorway and stepped resolutely out into the mud, and into the foul and poisonous wind.\r\n He paused for a moment to be sure that his footing was solid, that he had his balance, and then without another look back he walked away from them, out of the reach of the slimy things with legs, towards his ship.\r\n 'Now, what on earth did /that/ mean?'  said Dirk, irritably mimicking the odd triple wave.\r\n Richard came thundering down the stairs, threw open the door and plunged into the room, wild-eyed.\r\n 'Ross has been murdered!'  he shouted.\r\n 'Who the hell's Ross?'  shouted Dirk back at him.\r\n 'Whatsisname Ross, for God's sake,' exclaimed Richard, 'the new editor of /Fathom/.'\r\n 'What's /Fathom/?'  shouted Dirk again.\r\n 'Michael's bloody magazine, Dirk!  Remember?  Gordon chucked Michael off the magazine and gave it to this Ross guy to fun instead.  Michael hated him for that.  Well, last night Michael went and bloody murdered him!'\r\n He paused, panting.  'At least,' he said, 'he was murdered.  And Michael was the only one with any reason to.'\r\n He ran to the door, looked out at the retreating figure disappearing into the gloom, and spun round again.\r\n 'Is he coming back?'  said Richard.\r\n Dirk leapt to his feet and stood blinking for a moment.\r\n 'That's it…' he said, '/that's/ why Michael was the perfect subject.  /That's/ what I should have been looking for.  The thing the ghost made him do in order to establish his hold, the thing he had to be fundamentally /willing/ to do, the thing that would match the ghost's own purpose.  Oh my dear God.  He thinks we've supplanted them and that's what he wants to reverse.\r\n 'He thinks this is their world not ours.  /This/ was where they were going to settle and build their blasted paradise.  It matches every step of the way.\r\n 'You see,' he said, turning on Reg, 'what we have done?  I would not be surprised to discover that the accident your poor tormented soul out there is trying to reverse is the very thing which started life on this planet!'\r\n He turned his eyes suddenly from Reg, who was white and trembling, back to Richard.\r\n 'When did you hear this?'  he said, puzzled.\r\n 'Er, just now,' said Richard, 'on… on the phone.  Upstairs.'\r\n 'What?'\r\n 'It was Susan, I don't know how - said she had a message on her answering machine telling her about it.  She said the message… was from - she said it was from Gordon, but I think she was hysterical.\r\n Dirk, what the hell is happening?  Where are we?'\r\n 'We are four billion years in the past,' said Reg in a shaking voice, 'please don't ask me why it is that the phone works when we are anywhere in the Universe other than where it's actually connected, that's a matter you will have to take up with British Telecom, but -'\r\n 'Damn and blast British Telecom,' shouted Dirk, the words coming easily from force of habit.  He ran to the door and peered again at the dim shadowy figure trudging through the mud towards the Salaxalan ship, completely beyond their reach.\r\n 'How long,' said Dirk, quite calmly, 'would you guess that it's going to take that fat self deluding bastard to reach his ship?  Because that is how long we have.\r\n 'Come.  Let us sit down.  Let us think.  We have two minutes in which to decide what we are going to do.  After that, I very much suspect that the three of us, and everything we have ever known, including the coelacanth and the dodo, dear Professor, will cease ever to have existed.'\r\n He sat heavily on the sofa, then stood up again and removed Michael's discarded jacket from under him.  As he did so, a book fell out of the pocket.\r\n CHAPTER 35\r\n 'I think it's an appalling act of desecration,' said Richard to Reg, as they sat hiding behind a hedge.\r\n The night was full of summer smells from the cottage garden, and the occasional whiff of sea air which came in on the light breezes that were entertaining themselves on the coast of the Bristol Channel.\r\n There was a bright moon playing over the sea off in the distance, and by its light it was also possible to see some distance over Exmoor stretching away to the south of them.\r\n Reg sighed.\r\n 'Yes, maybe,' he said, 'but I'm afraid he's right, you know, it must be done.  It was the only sure way.  All the instructions were clearly contained in the piece once you knew what you were looking for.  It has to be suppressed.  The ghost will always be around.  In fact two of him now.  That is, assuming this works.  Poor devil.  Still, I suppose he brought it on himself.'\r\n Richard fretfully pulled up some blades of grass and twisted them between his fingers.\r\n He held them up to the moonlight, turned them to different angles, and watched the way light played on them.\r\n 'Such music,' he said.  'I'm not religious, but if I were I would say it was like a glimpse into the mind of God.  Perhaps it was and I ought to be religious.  I have to keep reminding myself that they didn't create the music, they only created the instrument which could read the score.  And the score was life itself.  And it's all up there.'\r\n He glanced into the sky.  Unconsciously he started to quote: 'Could I revive within me Her symphony and song To such a deep delight 'twould win me That with music loud and long I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome!  Those caves of ice!'\r\n 'Hmmm,' said Reg to himself, 'I wonder if he arrived early enough.'\r\n 'What did you say?'\r\n 'Oh, nothing.  Just a thought.'\r\n 'Good God, he can talk, can't he?'  Richard exclaimed suddenly.  'He's been in there over an hour now.  I wonder what's going on.'\r\n He got up and looked over the hedge at the small farm cottage basking in the moonlight behind them.  About an hour earlier Dirk had walked boldly up to the front door and rapped on it.\r\n When the door had opened, somewhat reluctantly, and a slightly dazed face had looked out, Dirk had doffed his absurd hat and said in a loud voice, 'Mr Samuel Coleridge?  ' I was just passing by, on my way from Porlock, you understand, and I was wondering if I might trouble you to vouchsafe me an interview?\r\n It's just for a little parish broadsheet I edit.  Won't take much of your time I promise, I know you must be busy, famous poet like you, but I do so admire your work, and…'\r\n The rest was lost, because by that time Dirk had effected his entry and closed the door behind him.\r\n 'Would you excuse me a moment?'  said Reg.\r\n 'What?  Oh sure,' said Richard, 'I'm just going to have a look and see what's happening.'\r\n While Reg wandered off behind a tree Richard pushed open the little gate and was just about to make his way up the path when he heard the sound of voices approaching the front door from within.\r\n He hurriedly darted back, as the front door started to open.\r\n 'Well, thank you very much indeed, Mr Coleridge,' said Dirk, as he emerged, fiddling with his hat and bowing, 'you have been most kind and generous with your time, and I do appreciate it very much, as I'm sure will my readers.  I'm sure it will work up into a very nice little article, a copy of which you may rest assured I will send you for you to peruse at your leisure.  I will most certainly welcome your comments if you have any, any points of style, you know, hints, tips, things of that nature.  Well, thank you again, so much, for your time, I do hope I haven't kept you from anything important -'\r\n The door slammed violently behind him.\r\n Dirk turned with another in a long succession of triumphant beams and hurried down the path to Richard.\r\n 'Well, that's put a stop to that,' he said, patting his hands together, 'I think he'd made a start on writing it down, but he won't remember another word, that's for certain.  Where's the egregious Professor?  Ah, there you are.  Good heavens, I'd no idea I'd been that long.  A most fascinating and entertaining fellow, our Mr Coleridge, or at least I'm sure he would have been if I'd given him the chance, but I was rather too busy being fascinating myself.\r\n 'Oh, but I did do as you asked, Richard, I asked him at the end about the albatross and he said what albatross?  So I said, oh it wasn't important, the albatross did not signify.  He said what albatross didn't signify, and I said never mind the albatross, it didn't matter, and he said it did matter - someone comes to his house in the middle of the night raving about albatrosses, he wanted to know why.  I said blast the bloody albatross and he said he had a good mind to and he wasn't certain that that didn't give him an idea for a poem he was working on.\r\n Much better, he said, than being hit by an asteroid, which he thought was stretching credulity a bit.  And so I came away.\r\n 'Now.  Having saved the entire human race from extinction I could do with a pizza.  What say you to such a proposal?'\r\n Richard didn't offer an opinion.  He was staring instead with some puzzlement at Reg.\r\n 'Something troubling you?'  said Reg, taken aback.\r\n 'That's a good trick,' said Richard, 'I could have sworn you didn't have a beard before you went behind the tree.'\r\n 'Oh -' Reg fingered the luxuriant three-inch growth - 'yes,' he said, 'just carelessness,' he said, 'carelessness.'\r\n 'What have you been up to?'\r\n 'Oh, just a few adjustments.  A little surgery, you understand.\r\n Nothing drastic.'\r\n A few minutes later as he ushered them into the extra door that a nearby cowshed had mysteriously acquired, he looked back up into the sky behind them, just in time to see a small light flare up and disappear.\r\n 'Sorry, Richard,' he muttered, and followed them in.\r\n CHAPTER 36\r\n 'Thank you, no,' said Richard firmly, 'much as I would love the opportunity to buy you a pizza and watch you eat it, Dirk, I want to go straight home.  I have to see Susan.  Is that possible, Reg?  Just straight to my flat?  I'll come up to Cambridge next week and collect my car.'\r\n 'We are already there,' said Reg, 'simply step out of the door, and you are home in your own flat.  It is early on Friday evening and the weekend lies before you.'\r\n 'Thanks.  Er, look, Dirk, I'll see you around, OK?  Do I owe you something?  I don't know.'\r\n Dirk waved the matter aside airily.  'You will hear from my Miss Pearce in due course,' he said.\r\n 'Fine, OK, well I'll see you when I've had some rest.  It's been, well, unexpected.'\r\n He walked to the door and opened it.  Stepping outside he found himself halfway up his own staircase, in the wall of which the door had materialised.\r\n He was about to start up the stairs when he turned again as a thought struck him.  He stepped back in, closing the door behind him.\r\n 'Reg, could we make one tiny detour?'  he said.  ' I think it would be a good move if I took Susan out for a meal tonight, only the place I have in mind you have to book in advance.  Could you manage three weeks for me?'\r\n 'Nothing could be easier,' said Reg, and made a subtle adjustment to the disposition of the beads on the abacus.  'There,' he said, 'We have travelled backwards in time three weeks.  You know where the phone is.'\r\n Richard hurried up the internal staircase to Reg's bedroom and phoned L'Esprit d'Escalier.  The maitre d' was charmed and delighted to take his reservation, and looked forward to seeing him in three weeks' time.  Richard went back downstairs shaking his head in wonder.\r\n 'I need a weekend of solid reality,' he said.  'Who was that just going out of the door?'\r\n 'That,' said Dirk, 'was your sofa being delivered.  The man asked if we minded him opening the door so they could manoeuvre it round and I said we would be delighted.'\r\n It was only a few minutes later that Richard found himself hurrying up the stairs to Susan's flat.  As he arrived at her front door he was pleased, as he always was, to hear the deep tones of her cello coming faintly from within.  He quietly let himself in and then as he walked to the door of her music room he suddenly froze in astonishment.  The tune she was playing was one he had heard before.  A little tripping tune, that slowed, then danced again but with more difficulty…\r\n His face was so amazed that she stopped playing the instant she saw him.\r\n 'What's wrong?'  she said, alarmed.\r\n 'Where did you get that music?'  said Richard in a whisper.\r\n She shrugged.  'Well, from the music shop,' she said, puzzled.  She wasn't being facetious, she simply didn't understand the question.\r\n 'What is it?'\r\n 'It's from a cantata I'm playing in in a couple of weeks,' she said, 'Bach, number six.'\r\n 'Who wrote it?'\r\n 'Well, Bach I expect.  If you think about it.'\r\n 'Who?'\r\n 'Watch my lips.  Bach.  B-A-C-H.  Johannes Sebastian.  Remember?'\r\n 'No, never heard of him.  Who is he?  Did he write anything else?'\r\n Susan put down her bow, propped up her cello, stood up and came over to him.\r\n 'Are you all right?'  she said.\r\n 'Er, it's rather hard to tell.  What's…'\r\n He caught sight of a pile of music books sitting in a corner of the room with the same name on the top one.  BACH.  He threw himself at the pile and started to scrabble through it.  Book after book - J. S. BACH.\r\n Cello sonatas.  Brandenburg Concertos.  A Mass in B Minor.\r\n He looked up at her in blank incomprehension.\r\n 'I've never seen any of this before,' he said.\r\n 'Richard my darling,' she said, putting her hand to his cheek, 'what on earth's the matter?  It's just Bach sheet music.'\r\n 'But don't you understand?'  he said, shaking a handful of the stuff.\r\n 'I've never, ever seen any of this before!'\r\n 'Well,' she said with mock gravity, 'perhaps if you didn't spend all your time playing with computer music…'\r\n He looked at her with wild surprise, then slowly he sat back against the wall and began to laugh hysterically.\r\n On Monday afternoon Richard phoned Reg.\r\n 'Reg!'  he said.  'Your phone is working.  Congratulations.'\r\n 'Oh yes, my dear fellow,' said Reg, 'how delightful to hear from you.  Yes.  A very capable young man arrived and fixed the phone a little earlier. "

        "text":"In most cases,\r\n\r\nthere will be multiple stakeholder roles found within each category.  Similarly, a single\r\n\r\n individual may fill more than one role.\r\n\r\n .1 Business Analyst\r\n\r\n By definition, the business analyst is a stakeholder in all business analysis activities.  The\r\n\r\n BABOK® Guide is written with the presumption that the business analysis is responsible\r\n\r\n and accountable for the execution of these activities.  In some cases, the business\r\n\r\n analyst may also be responsible for the performance of activities that fall under another\r\n\r\n stakeholder role.  The most common roles to be assigned to business analysts, in addition\r\n\r\n to the business analysis role, are the Domain Subject Matter Expert, Implementation\r\n\r\n Subject Matter Expert, Project Manager, and Tester.  Guidance on performing these\r\n\r\n additional roles falls outside the scope of the BABOK® Guide, as these roles are not part of\r\n\r\n the discipline of business analysis. \r\n .2 Customer\r\n\r\n A customer is a stakeholder outside the boundary of a given organization or organizational\r\n\r\n unit.  Customers make use of products or services produced by the organization and may\r\n\r\n have contractual or moral rights that the organization is obliged to meet.\r\n\r\n .3 Domain Subject Matter Expert (SME)\r\n\r\n A domain subject matter expert is any individual with in-depth knowledge of a topic\r\n\r\n relevant to the business need or solution scope.  This role is often filled by people who will\r\n\r\n also be end users or people who will be indirect users of the solution, such as managers,\r\n\r\nprocess owners, legal staff (who may act as proxies for Regulators), consultants, and\r\n\r\n others.\r\n\r\n .4 End User\r\n\r\n End users are stakeholders who will directly interact with the solution.  The term is most\r\n\r\n frequently used in a software development context, where end users are those who will\r\n\r\n actually use the software application that is being developed, but in the broader context\r\n\r\n of a solution they can include all participants in a business process.\r\n\r\n .5 Implementation Subject Matter Expert (SME)\r\n\r\n Implementation subject matter experts are responsible for designing and implementing\r\n\r\n potential solutions.  The implementation subject matter experts will provide specialist\r\n\r\n expertise on the design and construction of the solution components that fall outside the\r\n\r\n scope of business analysis.\r\n\r\n While it is not possible to define a listing of implementation subject matter expert roles\r\n\r\n that is appropriate for all initiatives, some of the most common roles are:\r\n\r\nDevelopers/Software Engineers\r\n\r\n Developers are responsible for the construction of software applications.  Areas of expertise among developers or software engineers include particular languages or\r\n\r\n application components.  Good software development practices will significantly reduce\r\n\r\n the cost to build an application, the predictability of the development process, and the\r\n\r\n ability to implement changes in the functionality supported by an application.\r\n\r\n Organizational Change Management Professionals\r\n\r\n Organizational change management professionals are responsible for facilitating\r\n\r\n acceptance and adoption of new solutions and overcoming resistance to change.  Areas\r\n\r\n of expertise among change management professionals include industry and cultural\r\n\r\n expertise.  Good change management can help to create advocates for change within an\r\n\r\n organization.\r\n\r\n System Architects\r\n\r\n System architects are responsible for dividing a software application into components\r\n\r\n and defining the interactions between them.  Areas of expertise among system architects\r\n\r\n include understanding of methodologies and of solutions offered by specific vendors.\r\n\r\n Good system architecture will facilitate rapid development of solutions and reuse of\r\n\r\n components in other solutions.\r\n\r\n Trainers\r\n\r\n Trainers are responsible for ensuring that the end users of a solution understand how it\r\n\r\n is supposed to work and are able to use it effectively.  Areas of expertise among trainers\r\n\r\n may include classroom-based or online education.  Effective training will facilitate\r\n\r\n acceptance and adoption of a solution.\r\n\r\n Usability Professionals\r\n\r\n Usability professionals are responsible for the external interaction design of technology\r\n\r\n solutions and for making those solutions as simple to use as is feasible.  Areas of expertise\r\n\r\n among usability professionals include user interface designers and information\r\n\r\n architects.  Good usability will increase productivity, customer satisfaction, and reduce\r\n\r\n cost in solution maintenance and training.\r\n\r\n .6 Project Manager\r\n\r\n Project managers are responsible for managing the work required to deliver a solution\r\n\r\n that meets a business need, and for ensuring that the project’s objectives are met while\r\n\r\n balancing the project constraints, including scope, budget, schedule, resources, quality,\r\n\r\nrisk, and others.\r\n\r\n .7 Tester\r\n\r\n Testers are responsible for determining how to verify that the solution meets the solution\r\n\r\n requirements defined by the business analyst, as well as conducting the verification\r\n\r\n process.  Testers also seek to ensure that the solution meets applicable quality standards\r\n\r\n and that the risk of defects of failures is understood and minimized.\r\n\r\n .8 Regulator\r\n\r\n Regulators are responsible for the definition and enforcement of standards.  Standards\r\n\r\n may be those that the team developing the solution is required to follow, standards the\r\n\r\n solution must meet, or both.  Regulators may enforce legislation, corporate governance\r\n\r\n standards, audit standards, or standards defined by organizational centers of competency.\r\n\r\n .9 Sponsor\r\n\r\n Sponsors are responsible for initiating the effort to define a business need and develop\r\n\r\n a solution that meets that need.  They authorize work to be performed and control the\r\n\r\n budget for the initiative.\r\n\r\n .10 Supplier\r\n\r\n A supplier is a stakeholder outside the boundary of a given organization or organizational\r\n\r\n unit.  Suppliers provide products or services to the organization and may have contractual\r\n\r\n or moral rights and obligations that must be considered.\r\n\r\n 1.5.7 Output\r\n\r\n An output is a necessary result of the work described in the task.  Outputs are created,\r\n\r\ntransformed or change state as a result of the successful completion of a task.  Although\r\n\r\n a particular output is created and maintained by a single task, a task can have multiple\r\n\r\n outputs.\r\n\r\n An output may be a deliverable or be a part of a larger deliverable.  The form of an output\r\n\r\n is dependent on the type of initiative underway, standards adopted by the organization,\r\n\r\nand best judgment of the business analyst as to an appropriate way to address the\r\n\r\n information needs of key stakeholders.\r\n\r\n As with inputs, an instance of a task may be completed without an output being in its\r\n\r\n final state.  The input or output only needs to be sufficiently complete to allow successive\r\n\r\n work to begin.  Similarly, there may be one or many instances of an output created as part\r\n\r\n of any given initiative.  Finally, the creation of an output does not necessarily require that\r\n\r\n subsequent tasks which use that work product as an input must begin.\r\n\r\n 1.6 Techniques\r\n\r\n Techniques provide additional information on different ways that a task may be\r\n\r\n performed or different forms the output of the task may take.  A task may have none, one,\r\n\r\nor more related techniques.  A technique must be related to at least one task.\r\n\r\n The BABOK® Guide does not prescribe a set of analysis techniques that must be used.\r\n\r\n The techniques described in this document are those that have been demonstrated\r\n\r\n to be of value and in use by a majority of the business analysis community.  Business\r\n\r\n analysts who are familiar with these techniques are therefore likely to be able to perform\r\n\r\n effectively under most circumstances that they are likely to encounter.  However, these\r\n\r\n techniques are not necessarily the best possible ones to use in any given situation, nor\r\n\r\n are they necessarily able to address every situation effectively.  Similarly, it is unlikely\r\n\r\n that a business analyst will be called on to demonstrate expertise with every technique\r\n\r\n defined in the BABOK® Guide.\r\n\r\n A subset of the techniques in the BABOK® Guide can be described as being in widespread\r\n\r\n use.  These techniques are in regular use by a majority of business analysts and see\r\n\r\n occasional use by the vast majority of practitioners, and it is likely that many if not\r\n\r\n most organizations will expect business analysts to have a working knowledge of these\r\n\r\n techniques.  The techniques that fall into this category are: \r\n▶ Acceptance and Evaluation Criteria Definition (9.1)\r\n\r\n ▶ Brainstorming (9.3)\r\n\r\n ▶ Business Rules Analysis (9.4)\r\n\r\n ▶ Data Dictionary and Glossary (9.5)\r\n\r\n ▶ Data Flow Diagrams (9.6)\r\n\r\n ▶ Data Modeling (9.7)\r\n\r\n ▶ Decision Analysis (9.8)\r\n\r\n ▶ Document Analysis (9.9)\r\n\r\n ▶ Interviews (9.14)\r\n\r\n ▶ Metrics and Key Performance Indicators (9.16)\r\n\r\n ▶ Non-functional Requirements Analysis (9.17)\r\n\r\n ▶ Organization Modeling (9.19)\r\n\r\n ▶ Problem Tracking (9.20)\r\n\r\n ▶ Process Modeling (9.21)\r\n\r\n ▶ Requirements Workshops (9.23)\r\n\r\n ▶ Scenarios and Use Cases (9.26)\r\n\r\n The BABOK® Guide may in some cases group similar techniques, or techniques that share\r\n\r\n a single purpose, under a single heading.  For example, the Data Modeling (9.7) technique\r\n\r\n covers class models and entity-relationship diagrams and could in principle cover\r\n\r\n concept maps, term and fact models, object role models, and other less widely-adopted\r\n\r\n analysis techniques.\r\n\r\n Each technique in the BABOK® Guide is presented in the following format:\r\n\r\n1.6.1 Purpose\r\n\r\n Defines what the technique is used for, and the circumstances under which it is most\r\n\r\n likely to be applicable.\r\n\r\n 1.6.2  Description\r\n\r\n Describes what the technique is and how it is used.\r\n\r\n 1.6.3  Elements\r\n\r\n The format and structure of this section is unique to each technique.  The elements section\r\n\r\n describes key concepts that are needed to understand how to use the technique.\r\n 1.6.4  Usage Considerations\r\n\r\n Describes conditions under which the technique may be more or less effective.\r\n\r\n 1.7 Underlying Competencies\r\n\r\n The underlying competencies are skills, knowledge and personal characteristics that\r\n\r\n support the effective performance of business analysis.  The underlying competency\r\n\r\n areas relevant to business analysis include:\r\n\r\nAnalytical Thinking and Problem Solving supports effective identification of business\r\n\r\n problems, assessment of proposed solutions to those problems, and understanding of\r\n\r\n the needs of stakeholders.  Analytical thinking and problem solving involves assessing\r\n\r\n a situation, understanding it as fully as possible, and making judgments about possible\r\n\r\n solutions to a problem.\r\n\r\n Behavioral Characteristics support the development of effective working relationships\r\n\r\n with stakeholders and include qualities such as ethics, trustworthiness, and personal\r\n\r\n organization.\r\n\r\n Business Knowledge supports understanding of the environment in which business\r\n\r\n analysis is performed and knowledge of general business principles and available\r\n\r\n solutions.\r\n\r\n Communication Skills support business analysts in eliciting and communicating\r\n\r\n requirements among stakeholders.  Communication skills address the need to listen to\r\n\r\n and understand the audience, understanding how an audience perceives the business\r\n\r\n analyst, understanding of the communications objective(s), the message itself, and the\r\n\r\n most appropriate media and format for communication.\r\n\r\n Interaction Skills support the business analyst when working with large numbers of\r\n\r\n stakeholders, and involve both the ability to work as part of a larger team and to help that\r\n\r\n team reach decisions.  While most of the work of business analysis involves identifying\r\n\r\n and describing a desired future state, the business analyst must also be able to help the\r\n\r\n organization reach agreement that the future state in question is desired through a\r\n\r\n combination of leadership and facilitation.\r\n\r\n Software Applications are used to facilitate the collaborative development, recording\r\n\r\n and distribution of requirements to stakeholders.  Business analysts should be skilled\r\n\r\n users of the tools used in their organization and must understand the strengths and\r\n\r\n weaknesses of each.\r\n\r\n 1.8 Other Sources of Business Analysis Information\r\n\r\n The BABOK® Guide is a synthesis of information on the business analysis role drawn\r\n\r\n from a wide variety of approaches to business improvement and change.  A complete\r\n\r\n listing of works referenced in the development of the BABOK® Guide can be found in\r\n\r\n Appendix B: Bibliography.  Business analysts looking to expand on their understanding of\r\n\r\n business analysis may wish to consult works in these other fields, obtain training from\r\n\r\n specialists in these areas, or pursue other opportunities for education and professional\r\n\r\n development.\r\n In particular, we have drawn on information from the following application areas for\r\n\r\n business analysis and related professional bodies of knowledge:\r\n\r\n▶ Agile Development\r\n\r\n ▶ Business Intelligence\r\n\r\n ▶ Business Process Management\r\n\r\n ▶ Business Rules\r\n\r\n ▶ Decision Analysis and Game Theory\r\n\r\n ▶ Enterprise Architecture (including the Zachman Framework for Enterprise\r\n\r\n ArchitectureTM and TOGAFTM)\r\n\r\n ▶ Governance and Compliance Frameworks, including Sarbanes-Oxley, Basel II, and\r\n\r\n others\r\n\r\n ▶ IT Service Management (including ITIL®)\r\n\r\n ▶ Lean and Six Sigma\r\n\r\n ▶ Organizational Change Management\r\n\r\n ▶ Project Management\r\n\r\n ▶ Quality Management\r\n\r\n ▶ Service Oriented Architecture\r\n\r\n ▶ Software Engineering (particularly Requirements Engineering)\r\n\r\n ▶ Software Process Improvement (including CMMI®)\r\n\r\n ▶ Software Quality Assurance\r\n\r\n ▶ Strategic Planning\r\n\r\n ▶ Usability and User Experience Design\r\n\r\n The BABOK® Guide focuses on defining the business analysis role across a broad range\r\n\r\n of business analysis approaches and so only touches briefly on much of the information\r\n\r\n developed by practitioners working in these fields.  Business analysts will find that a\r\n\r\n study of any of those areas will be rewarded with a greater understanding of the business\r\n\r\n analysis profession, ability to collaborate with other professionals, and an understanding\r\n\r\n of a number of different ways that business analysts can benefit the organizations that\r\n\r\n employ them."

It's all Greek.\"\r\n 1:20\r\nI know you understand all of the words, it's just they're put together in such a way it's\r\n1:24\r\ndifficult, and that doesn't matter if you're reading your own language or another language.\r\n 1:28\r\nBut there are a lot of benefits when you're learning another language that reading gives you.\r\n 1:33\r\nAnd a lot of people want to talk and listen, but reading has some power.\r\n 1:37\r\nAnd let's address that now.\r\n 1:38\r\nOkay?\r\n 1:39\r\nSo mind maps are reading comprehension.\r\n 1:41\r\nDon't worry if you haven't seen the mind map, it's coming up in a second or two.\r\n 1:44\r\nBut the first thing I want to talk to you about is reading helps you understand the\r\n1:49\r\nway that the language is put together.\r\n 1:51\r\nMost of you will come and...\r\n1:53\r\nYou come to engVid to learn vocabulary and grammar, but that doesn't help you with syntax,\r\n1:58\r\nthat doesn't help you with putting the words together in a logical way.\r\n 2:02\r\nReading does that because...\r\n2:04\r\nWell, let's face facts, when you're reading someone is actually speaking to you but they're\r\n2:09\r\nnot in front of you.\r\n 2:10\r\nSo the problem is if they're not very clear and they don't use the language well, you\r\n2:14\r\nwon't really understand them.\r\n 2:16\r\nRight?\r\n 2:17\r\nSo reading teaches you how to...\r\n2:19\r\nThe language is put together, where the verbs go, and when's a better place to use the verb\r\n2:23\r\nor a noun, and how you can show expressions.  Okay?\r\n 2:27\r\nReading also teaches you how to speak by showing you the way that the language is used by the\r\n2:32\r\nnative speakers.\r\n 2:33\r\nHuh?  Well, if it's a fiction book they actually say:\r\n2:36\r\n\"-'Johnny, are you coming?'\r\n 2:39\r\n-'Yes.'  Dah, dah, dah, dah\",\r\n2:40\r\nand they show you how we use the language.\r\n 2:42\r\nSo not only do you understand how to put the language together by looking at it and going:\r\n2:45\r\n\"Ah, comma here, period here\", but then they say:\r\n2:48\r\n\"Hey, this is how we speak.\"\r\n 2:50\r\nSo if you follow this you can actually use that kind of method or sys-...\r\n2:55\r\nNot system.\r\n 2:56\r\nYou can follow those words and actually speak like we do.\r\n 2:58\r\nAll right?\r\n 2:59\r\nNumber three, vocabulary.\r\n 3:02\r\nI talked about it up here.\r\n 3:03\r\nReading introduces vocabulary in a natural way.\r\n 3:07\r\nHave you ever had a teacher or read a book where they have 20 words and they say:\r\n3:10\r\n\"These are your 20 words\"?\r\n 3:12\r\nAnd when you look back, you're like:\r\n3:13\r\n\"Why did they teach me these 20 and not these 20,\r\n3:15\r\nand why this word and not that word?\"\r\n 3:17\r\nWell, when they're reading they're saying: \"Here's words\", and you can see the vocabulary,\r\n3:21\r\nyou can look at the picture that it's in-and that's a key that I'm going to say picture;\r\n 3:25\r\nI'll come back to that-and you can see: \"Ah, that's how it fits, and now I have an understanding\r\n3:30\r\nof the word not just by dictionary definition, but how people actually use it in real life\r\n3:35\r\nin that language.\"\r\n 3:36\r\nOkay?\r\n 3:37\r\nSo at the end of it I say: Reading is good for you, like an orange.\r\n 3:39\r\nYou know, you have orange juice?\r\n 3:41\r\nDelicious.\r\n 3:42\r\nIt's good for you.  Right?\r\n 3:44\r\nBut there is a key that you have to remember, and that is: Reading is difficult if you don't\r\n3:49\r\nknow 80% of the vocabulary, and this is where the mind map comes in.\r\n 3:54\r\nIf you don't know 80% of the vocabulary you won't understand most of what is on the paper.\r\n 3:59\r\nBut the funny thing is if you see a picture, even if you don't know all the words, you\r\n4:03\r\ncan understand how that picture goes together.\r\n 4:04\r\nRight?\r\n 4:05\r\nWe're going to use mind maps to create a picture for you to look at and understand, and then\r\n4:09\r\ntake some of the vocabulary that you may not know and give you a really clear understanding.\r\n 4:15\r\nReady for your next adventure?\r\n 4:17\r\nLet's turn to the next chapter.\r\n 4:18\r\n[Snaps]\r\n4:19\r\nOkay, so I promised a mind map for reading, and voila.\r\n 4:24\r\nBut before I get there, I want to just go over a couple of things.  Okay?\r\n 4:28\r\nWhy do we have...?\r\n 4:30\r\nThere are three reasons for the mind map.\r\n 4:31\r\nI discussed what reading was about.\r\n 4:33\r\nBut I discussed reading, but I didn't talk about the mind map and how they actually go\r\n4:37\r\ntogether, and I'm going to fix that right now.\r\n 4:40\r\nWe want to use the mind map to do these three things to make reading much easier.\r\n 4:44\r\nDo you remember I said if you don't understand at least 80%, so it's only 20% you don't understand,\r\n4:50\r\nreading something will be impossible?\r\n 4:52\r\nThese are the three reasons we want to go to mind maps to make that 20% just disappear\r\n4:57\r\nand work for us.\r\n 4:58\r\nFirst, a mind map forces you...\r\n5:01\r\nOkay, so they break down...\r\n5:02\r\nThey force you to break down information into smaller parts that are easier to understand.\r\n 5:07\r\nHere's my fist, I'm going to eat it.\r\n 5:10\r\n[Mumbles].\r\n 5:11\r\nYou see, I can't.\r\n 5:12\r\nBut if I do this, we make it smaller, it's easier to eat.\r\n 5:17\r\nOkay?\r\n 5:18\r\nWhen you have a page of information and 20% you don't understand, you just go:\r\n5:22\r\n\"I don't understand.\"\r\n 5:24\r\nBut when you break it into parts you can go:\r\n5:27\r\n\"Hey, I know this word, and this word works with that\", it's easier for you to digest or to take in.\r\n 5:33\r\nNumber two, once you're finished the mind map all of the information can be seen quickly\r\n5:38\r\nat a glance.\r\n 5:39\r\nA glance is a quick look.\r\n 5:40\r\nWhen you...\r\n5:42\r\nNo, that's not a glance.\r\n 5:43\r\nThis is.\r\n 5:44\r\nSee?\r\n 5:45\r\nThat means a quick look.\r\n 5:46\r\nI want to be able to look at a piece of paper and get the picture right away.\r\n 5:50\r\nAnd if you think about it, when you look at a picture, you don't look corner, corner,\r\n5:54\r\ncorner, corner, corner.\r\n 5:55\r\nYou look, you see the picture, you understand it.\r\n 5:58\r\nThat's what a mind map does for you.\r\n 6:00\r\nAnd finally, the third thing is there are lots of pictures.\r\n 6:03\r\nYou're going to notice lots of silly pictures.\r\n 6:05\r\nWell, it makes it easier to remember.\r\n 6:07\r\nBecause let's face it, if you read something and you don't remember it, you never read it.\r\n 6:12\r\nSo I'm going to say that again to make sure you understand.\r\n 6:14\r\nOkay?\r\n 6:15\r\nIf you read something and you don't remember what you read, you never read it.\r\n 6:21\r\nWith a mind map, because you get these little pictures, you can put a picture in your head\r\n6:24\r\neasily.\r\n 6:25\r\nIt's easy to recall or bring back that information and remember it.\r\n 6:29\r\nSo the three advantages are we can break it into pieces we understand.\r\n 6:33\r\nOkay?\r\n 6:34\r\nWhen we need the information-[snaps]-it's quick.\r\n 6:36\r\nI don't need to go page, page.\r\n 6:37\r\nI can look and go: \"Got it.\"\r\n 6:39\r\nAnd number three, I don't even have to look.\r\n 6:41\r\nI can just remember.\r\n 6:43\r\nNice.  Right?  All right.\r\n 6:44\r\nSo let's take a look at a very general mind map.\r\n 6:47\r\nWhat do I mean by general?\r\n 6:49\r\nThis mind map is to give you an idea, sort of like a base.\r\n 6:52\r\nFrom here you can modify this type of mind map to use it for any other reading.\r\n 6:56\r\nSo if you're a business guy or you're a history person, you're like: \"This doesn't help me\",\r\n7:00\r\nwait, I'll show you how it can help you.\r\n 7:03\r\nBut for now let's go through the basic things you can do to make it easier.\r\n 7:06\r\nSo you've read your book.  Okay?\r\n 7:07\r\nYou're reading through the pages.\r\n 7:09\r\nWhile you're reading it, some of the things you can do is right off the bat you can have\r\n7:13\r\na little mind map-where are we? -vocabulary, a little arm here that goes into voca-...\r\n7:17\r\nNew vocabulary.\r\n 7:18\r\nWith the new vocabulary, you can write the word out, go to your dictionary, find a synonym.\r\n 7:23\r\nThe dictionary usually has antonyms and synonym.\r\n 7:25\r\nSynonym means a word that seems the same or is similar to this word,\r\n7:29\r\nand the antonym is the opposite.\r\n 7:32\r\nOkay?  So we can look for synonyms which may help us.\r\n 7:35\r\nSo you might know the word \"dog\", but you don't know the word \"mutt\".\r\n 7:38\r\nA mutt is a type of dog that's mixed.\r\n 7:41\r\nSo that's a synonym for \"dog\".\r\n 7:43\r\nSo you can use that by using your dictionary, and this will help you remember that word,\r\n7:47\r\nand plus make your vocabulary wider.\r\n 7:49\r\nCool.  Right?\r\n 7:50\r\nAnd next thing is almost every book you read, especially if it's for school-and a lot of\r\n7:55\r\nyou I know want to go to school or you're reading books-you need general information.\r\n 7:59\r\nSo in this kind we can put down the type of book.\r\n 8:01\r\nIs it science?\r\n 8:02\r\nIs it business?\r\n 8:03\r\nIs it fiction?\r\n 8:04\r\nWho is the author?\r\n 8:05\r\nThe Donald Trump haircut.\r\n 8:06\r\nSee?\r\n 8:07\r\nIt's blowing away.\r\n 8:08\r\nWho's the author?\r\n 8:09\r\nPut the author's name.\r\n 8:10\r\nAnd then when was it published?\r\n 8:12\r\nPublished means: When did you make this...?\r\n 8:14\r\nOr, sorry.\r\n 8:15\r\nWhen did they make the book?\r\n 8:16\r\nWhen was it written and completed?\r\n 8:19\r\nYou might want this because the information might be old.\r\n 8:21\r\nWe call it dated, and it's no good anymore.\r\n 8:23\r\nOr it could be relevant, which means it's good and useful now.\r\n 8:27\r\nRight?\r\n 8:28\r\nAnd that publishing helps you.\r\n 8:29\r\nIt's a quick glance.  Remember?\r\n 8:30\r\nYou might read five books and you can quickly go through everything you need on one piece\r\n8:34\r\nof paper.\r\n 8:35\r\nEspecially when you're writing an essay it's important because you need this.\r\n 8:39\r\nOkay?\r\n 8:39\r\nComprehension.\r\n 8:40\r\nI'm going to come back to that one, because that's usually for me the last thing that happens.\r\n 8:45\r\nSo let's go over here.\r\n 8:46\r\nAfter you've written down your basic information-okay? -you're going to write chapters.\r\n 8:50\r\nYou read it.\r\n 8:50\r\nI don't care what book you read, they have chapters.\r\n 8:52\r\nWell, have...\r\n8:53\r\nSorry.  Let me correct myself.\r\n 8:55\r\nIf they're good books they have chapters.\r\n 8:57\r\nMagazines even have chapters.\r\n 8:59\r\nRight?\r\n 9:00\r\nDifferent part, you know, there's the food one, there's the investment, on clothing.\r\n 9:04\r\nIt's not called a chapter, but you get the idea.\r\n 9:07\r\nYou can put the chapter's title, the basic information because a lot of times they'll\r\n9:11\r\noutline what is in this chapter, and then you can put down the important details that\r\n9:15\r\nyou get.\r\n 9:16\r\nIt doesn't have to be what the book says, it's what maybe you think or what the book says.\r\n 9:20\r\nThis organizes that information so that when you go back it's easier to remember than to\r\n9:24\r\nread 400 pages.\r\n 9:27\r\nTimeline.\r\n 9:28\r\nThings happen at a certain time.\r\n 9:30\r\nSo what happened and when?\r\n 9:32\r\nFor history this is perfect.\r\n 9:33\r\nNow, do you remember I told you we could modify one?\r\n 9:36\r\nYou don't need this if this is business.\r\n 9:37\r\nIt's not necessary to have a timeline, but you might have something called business strategies\r\n9:42\r\nand it could be business strategies and strategy number one for marketing, strategy number\r\n9:46\r\ntwo for investment.\r\n 9:48\r\nBut let's go back again and say this...\r\n9:50\r\nWe wanted to change this once again and we wanted to talk about a fictional book, the\r\n9:55\r\nlife of Muhammad Ali, for instance.\r\n 9:58\r\nWe could change this to put down characters.\r\n 10:00\r\nAnd when we say characters, it would be Muhammad Ali's a character, lead character, maybe his\r\n10:04\r\nbrother is another character for the personality, or when we talk about the types of characters\r\n10:11\r\nthat are in the book.\r\n 10:12\r\nYou can use it for a whole bunch of things.\r\n 10:14\r\nSo you can take this one arm out and change it.\r\n 10:16\r\nSo we could use it for business, for strategies, you could use it for fiction writing to describe\r\n10:22\r\nthe characters that are in there.\r\n 10:26\r\nNow, Muhammad Ali's non-fiction, but let's pretend he went to the moon, that would be\r\n10:31\r\na fictional book.  Okay?\r\n 10:32\r\nSo in case you're like: \"He's a real guy, I know him!\"\r\n 10:34\r\nYou don't know him.\r\n 10:36\r\nI'm just saying if it was a non-fiction, the guy's name was Muhammad Ali.\r\n 10:40\r\nOkay?  But just you understand, but we can talk about the different types of characters in here\r\n10:44\r\nor investment strategies.\r\n 10:45\r\nSo this one arm can be taken out, and this way you can modify this basic mind map for\r\n10:51\r\nreading to what you're reading and doing right now.\r\n 10:54\r\nNow, I talked about all of these and I wanted to leave this one to the end because\r\n10:57\r\ncomprehension means to understand.\r\n 11:00\r\nNo matter what you read and what you're told, there's always something that you've learned\r\n11:04\r\nfrom that book.\r\n 11:06\r\nAnd this is the one that you want to really keep on regardless because you might want\r\n11:09\r\nto say: \"I learned this.\"\r\n 11:12\r\nor \"I got this out of this book.\"\r\n 11:14\r\nBecause when you're going back and it's been a month since you read it or you have to do\r\n11:17\r\nan assignment, it's kind of good to say in your conclusion even:\r\n11:21\r\n\"This is what I learned.  This is what I got from this.\"\r\n 11:24\r\nRight?\r\n 11:25\r\nCool?\r\n 11:25\r\nWell, look, I hope this mind map lesson has been really good for you.\r\n 11:29\r\nI enjoyed it.\r\n 11:30\r\nI'm sure you got something and you can use it.\r\n 11:33\r\nAnd once again, if there was some...\r\n11:34\r\nYou know, some basic questions you had, check in the link, there's a link to the first lesson\r\n11:40\r\nI did which was very general giving more of an idea of\r\n11:42\r\nwhat is a mind map and why do you use it.\r\n 11:44\r\nOkay?\r\n 11:45\r\nSo anyway, I'd like to say thank you once again.\r\n 11:48\r\nI always appreciate when you watch our videos, Mr. E and I, though he's not here.\r\n 11:52\r\nAlso, I want you to subscribe, and that's somewhere around here.\r\n 11:56\r\nIf you just look in the box you'll find it.\r\n 11:58\r\nAnd the last thing I want to say is this: As I said, I think you found this helpful,\r\n12:03\r\nand if that's the case - do me a favour?\r\n 12:06\r\nShow someone else.\r\n 12:07\r\nBecause if you learn something from it, you should share your knowledge.\r\n 12:10\r\nThat's what we do here at engVid, we'd love it if you can do it as well.\r\n 12:13\r\nAnyway, have a good one and pick up a book."

        "text":"Ball оf Paper\r\n by William Cooper\r\n I was in my lab one afternoon.  It must have been about half-past five, anyway, time to think about going home.  There were a couple of\r\n observations I wanted to make before I went and it was a quarter of an hour before I could make the second check.  During that quarter of an\r\n hour the wretched Johnson incident happened.\r\n I decided to use the spare time filling up a form.  This form was to do with Johnson's promotion.  Johnson had got to go up-for an inter-\r\n view and he couldn't go till the form was completed.  I'd given our Establishment Officer my word that I'd definitely do it before I went\r\n home this afternoon.  I was Johnson's senior officer and whoever read that particular bit of paper was probably going to pay some attention\r\n to what I said on it.  I hoped they would anyway.  Since Johnson came to me he'd done a good job as an Experimental Officer.  I could put my hand on my heart and say that.  But he was not everything he ought to be.  He was inconsistent, inconsistent in a way I just somehow couldn't put up with.\r\n I'm not consistent at all myself.  I work in bursts and keep irregular hours.\r\n But I can see the sense in that.  I couldn't see the sense in the way Johnson \r\n went on.  He wasn't consistent intellectually.  He wasn't consistent in his\r\n attitude either.  More than once I caught him going behind my back for\r\n something he wanted.  In fact, he'd have done me one or two dirty tricks if I \r\n hadn't found out and stopped him.  But that's the personal side of it.  What \r\n really bothered me was the way he was erratic in his ideas.\r\n To be fair to the man, I've got to admit that he'd had a lot of experience.  He had some good ideas as well.  I'd even go so far as to say one or two of them were really good, far beyond what you could expect from an E.O.  He'd also had quite a few bad ones, in fact bad is hardly the word for them.  They were blunders.  On top of all he had an ungovernable temper.\r\n It was a very difficult decision to make.  Moving Johnson up fro, E.O. to S.S.O. was risky.  A man as erratic as Johnson is a risk anywhere.  In our kind of work he's a menace.  But I had to admit that as the years went by he was getting more sensible.  He was having his good ideas just as often and he was making blunders less frequently.  I was coming round to thinking the risk might be worth taking.  These were the lines I was thinking along, and I should have gone on thinking all of them if Johnson hadn't come into the room that evening just at the critical moment. \r\n I suppose you must have guessed that Johnson thought the reason he hadn't succeeded in getting promoted already was because I'd given him a bad write-up, that I was responsible for the delay.  Mind you, it was a difficult thing to do, to get the kind of appointment he was aiming at.  Johnson had it fixed in his head that a poor write-up from me would not permit our people to promote him.  As usual he was exaggerating.  I'd first reported impartially on his actual work, and then given my personal opinion of the risk of making him an S.S.O.  After that it was up to them.\r\n On the last two occasions the Commission had come down on my side of the line.  Now I'd come to the conclusion that the line didn’t  quite stand where it did.  The man was definitely taking himself in hand, both in his ideas and in his personal behavior.  I thought the risk was definitely less than it had been, and I was prepared to say so.  And that, I thought, might mean that this time Johnson would get what he wanted.\r\n I picked up my pen.  Now I'd got down to it, the job was not as disagreeable as it might have been.\r\n I was just reading the form over before I put my name to it when the door flew open.  It was Johnson.  I could tell by the look in his eyes that he knew what I was doing.\r\n I shall now have to describe the lab.  It was what's called a hot lab. \r\n This means there are radio-active substances about the place that can do you serious harm if you expose yourself to too much radiation from them.  You've probably seen pictures of people working in hot labs, handling things by remote control, wearing protective clothing and all the rest of it.  The labs are air-conditioned, they don't have any windows and they are constantly being swept and polished.\r\n What caught your eye when you came into my lab was an object \r\n called a coffin in the middle of the floor.  A coffin is a large brick-shaped\r\n block of solid lead with a cavity on the top.  Lead is one of the best materials for stopping radiation.  At the bottom of the cavity lay a uranium slug  —  that's where the radiation was coming from.  The slug was fresh from the reactor.\t : \r\nWhat goes on in an atomic pile is this.  Bars of uranium, called slugs, are pushed along channels through the reactor, and while they're there fission of the uranium takes place, so that when they come out at the other end they've been partly transformed into plutonium and fission products.  What I have to draw your attention to is that the longer the slug has been in the pile, the more active it's likely to be when it comes out.\r\n I can't describe the experiments I was doing because they are secret.  The only two things you need to know I actually can tell you.  First, the slugs I was experimenting with had been kept in the reactor a long time.  Second, the coffin I was using was one I had designed myself, and it gave very little protection.  I didn't like that, naturally.  But I couldn't do the experiments on the slug that I wanted to do unless I had that design of coffin.  So there it was.  When we weren't doing any experiments we covered the cavity over with lead bricks.  When the bricks were off you had to keep way.\r\n So there we were, Johnson and I facing each other.\r\n Johnson's eyes were bulging.  His specs were slipping off his nose.\r\n \"Oh, hello,\" I said.  I put down my pen.\r\n \"Hello, Curtis.\"  He spoke in a menacing tone and what's more he dared to come and stand not far from my elbow.  I was used to dealing with him in this mood.  I said:\r\n\"You've just come in time, Johnson.  The next observation is due\r\n at  — \" I don't remember now actually what time it was, but I told him then.\t \"O.K.,\" he said.  \"That leaves us eight minutes.  I wanted to have a\r\n word with you about that, Curtis.\"\r\n \"About what?\"  I said.\r\n \"About that confidential report on me.\"  There was no denying it.\r\n \"I'm not going to pretend it's not what you think it is, Johnson.\"  I said.  \"It is.\"\r\n He came still nearer.  His eyes were now popping out of his head,not at me, but in an effort to read what I'd written.\r\n \"What I'd like to know,\" he said, \"is whether you're going to wreck\r\n my chances again.\"\t .\t .  .\r\n \"Who said I wrecked your chances before?\"\r\n \"Come off it, Curtis;  you know you did.  That's why I'm going to have it out with you now.  I want to know where I stand.\"\r\n \"You seem to know more than I do.\"\r\n \"For once I don't.\"\r\n I was pretty fed up with him.\r\n \"I'm going to tell you what I've written about you, and then you\r\n can judge for yourself.  It'll be up to you then to decide whether I'm wrecking your chances or not. "

There are about 50 principal theatres in professional use in or near the West End and some 20 in the suburbs.\r\n\r\n Most of these are let to producing managements on a commercial basis but some of them are permanently occupied by subsidised companies, such as the National Theatre which stages classical and modern plays in its complex of three theatres on the South Bank of the River Thames.  The former Old Vic Company, which was Britain's major theatrical touring company, has now taken up residence in the National Theatre, changing its name to the National Theatre Company.  In addition the Royal Shakespeare Company presents Shakespearean plays at Stradford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire in London.\r\n\r\n Outside London there are many non-repertory theatres which present all kinds of drama and also put on variety shows and other entertainments.  Recently there has been a growth in the activity of repertory companies which receive financial support from the Arts Council and the local authorities.  These companies employ leading producers, designers and actors, and the standard of productions is generally high.  Some companies have their own theatres, while others rent from the local authorities.\r\n\r\n Music of all kinds - \"pop\" music, folk music, jazz, light music and brass bands - is an important part of British cultural life.  The large audiences at orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, ballet and chamber music reflect the widespread interest in classical music.\r\n\r\n The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts Council, gives regular seasons of opera and ballet.  It has its own orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet.  Both companies have a high international reputation.  The English National Opera which performs in the London Coliseum gives seasons of opera and operetta in English.  It also tours the provinces.\r\n\r\n In 1998 the Government announced the formation of the Young Music Trust to develop the musical skills of the young with some money from the National Lottery, and donations from music charities and companies involved in music business.  The national youth orchestras of Great Britain have established high standards.\r\n\r\n There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain.  Most universities have thriving amateur drama clubs and societies.  Every year an International Festival of University Theatre is held."

These particular sentences are 'zero conditionals'.\r\n Let's look at another type of conditional sentence - 'first conditionals'.  First conditionals are used to explain about conditions that have a real possibility of happening in the future.  It's not 100% sure, but there is a big chance it will happen.\r\n Let's look at an example.  'If I study hard, I'll pass the test'.  Is there a chance for me to pass the test if I study hard?  Yes!  Can this happen?  Yes!  Does it mean that my passing 100% guaranteed?  No.  But that is a very likely thing, that can happen.  That is a first conditional sentence.  It has the structure of: IF plus Present Tense clause, WILL + Present Tense close.\r\n Now for another example.  So, you just woke up, and looking outside the window you see gray clouds.  You say to yourself, 'If it rains, I'll go back to sleep'.  Or you can also say, 'I'll go back to sleep if it rains'.  Is this situation possible?  Yes.  Will the situation happen 100%?  No.\r\n So it's pretty much what first conditional is.  It's to talk about things that have high chance of happening. \r\n Now you try to make a first conditional sentence in the comment section below.  I will see if you're correct."

However, after thinking about the benefits that Yuan Su had brought to him that were immeasurable, his heart felt at at ease and relieved.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui had originally thought of leaving some items behind for her, however there was really no need for that.  Since doing so would increase her distress, Qing Shui chose to leave without a single trace of hesitation.\r\n\r\n He already treated Yuan Su as an honored person along his life journey.  Perhaps he was also an honored person in her life, however both of them were passing travelers in each of their lives.\r\n\r\n Since she had made this choice, Qing Shui felt that this might be the best conclusion to this matter.\r\n\r\n Looking at the disappearing figure of Qing Shui, Yuan Su’s heart had become disordered for a moment.  Thinking about the imminent takeover of the Medicinal Pill Sect, a wave of jitters rocked through her heart, before shaking her head and riding her yellow bird back to the Medicinal Pill Sect.\r\n\r\n ……\r\n\r\n Qing Shui did not return to the Di Family and instead rushed towards Central Plains.  Before he left, he had to send his greetings to Lady Duanmu,\r\n端木城！\r\n Duanmu City!\r\n\r\n Qing Mu rode on his Fire Bird.  As of now the speed of the Fire Bird was much faster than before.  Coupled with the Nine Continents Steps, it took him much less time to reach Duanmu City.\r\n\r\n On the second day he had already arrived at Duanmu City.  With the Fire Bird having a fold increase in speed, coupled with the Nine Continents Steps, the distance between regions was akin to crossing doors for Qing Shui.\r\n\r\n Upon arriving on the door of the Duanmu Family House, it just so happened that Duanmu Lingshang was leaving the house.  Looking at her, he felt slightly awkward.\r\n\r\n Previously, during the period of time at the Flower Fruit Mountain, he had teased this frosty and icy lady.\r\n\r\n “ Young Lady Duanmu!”  greeted Qing Shui with a smile.\r\n\r\n “Why are you here?”  exclaimed Duanmu Lingshuang as she looked at Qing Shui in surprise.  Due to her azure dress coupled with her icy cold expression, even the words she said made people feel a chill in their bones.\r\n\r\n “Are you going out?”  Qing Shui did not reply to the question of why he was here.Taking a look he asked Duanmu Lingshang who was seemingly going out.\r\n\r\n “I originally planned on going out.  Since you have come over, let’s go.  Mother’s in the house.”  said Duanmu Lingshang who felt slightly awkward.  However she felt that it would be even weirder if she had not said it.\r\n\r\n In actual fact Duanmu Lingshang did not think about the matter between Qing Shui and her mother.  Even if it was told to her she would not believe it.  To her, her mother was the most pure and holy woman and would absolutely never do such a thing.  Therefore, she still acted like before.\r\n\r\n “You’re here!”\r\n\r\n If one was to pay close attention, one would be able to discover the change in Qing Shui and Yu Ruyan.  It was a kind of indescribable flavor that felt slightly surprising and awkward for her when she saw Qing Shui.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui knew and understood this, as after all she was different from Yuan Su.  They had truly gone all the way and have done the most intimate of things.  Furthermore, she had felt that even she was unable to endure it.\r\n\r\n “Yes, I’ve come today to inform Madame and young lady that I’m returning to the Greencloud Continent.”  said Qing Shui softly after the three of them took a seat.\r\n\r\n “Yes, you should go back.  When are you preparing to head back?”  asked Yu Ruyan with a faint smile as before without any change of her former expression.\r\n\r\n “After preparing I’ll head back in a couple of days.  When I’m leaving I won’t come and say my goodbyes to madame again.”  replied Qing Shui as he looked at Yu Ruyan.\r\n\r\n “Okay, please take care on your way back and be careful.”\r\n\r\n Yu Ruyan did not know what to say to Qing Shui while Duanmu Lingshang maintained her silence.  Occasionally saying a word or two, her loneliness gave people a feeling of being very natural.\r\n\r\n Taking out two sets of fur coats, bracelets and necklaces like the ones that he had given to Hai Dongqing, he gave one set each to Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang before saying: “ I’m going to head back.  Here’s some gifts for you two.  If there’s anything you need remember to find me.”\r\n\r\n Yu Ruyan nodded her head, and pretended to be calm receiving the presents from Qing Shui while replying to him.\r\n\r\n Duanmu Lingshuang seemed very happy and gave a rare smile towards Qing Shui.  She had seemingly no friends of the opposite sex and had very little contact with other people.  However she had a quite a lot of interactions with Qing Shui.  In her memories, Qing Shui was considered as the most familiar friend from the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n In a previous encounter when Qing Shui had met up with Yu Ruyan, they had chatted about a lot of things unrestrictedly.  However this could only be considered as being one another’s best friend and the probability of progressing to the next level was not high.\r\n\r\n After stopping for a short while Qing Shui had to leave.  Although Yu Ruyan and Duanmu Lingshuang tried to urge him to stay, Qing Shui still wanted to leave.  After all, it was inappropriate to stay longer due to that matter, after leaving this time, perhaps it might be forgotten in a few years.\r\n\r\n Continuing on his journey back, he wanted to say his goodbyes the Nian Feng grandfather and grandson.  He had also wanted to say his farewells to Lan Tong and the rest.  All of this was arranged by Qing Shui very quickly, with Qing Shui allowing them to remain in the Jade Sea Country and if anything happens they can find the Nian Feng Family.  Qing Shui allowed them to visit the Nian Feng grandfather and grandson once while arranging for Lan Tong and the rest to gift them with seafood after dining in the Nian Feng restaurant.\r\n\r\n It was a kind of fate to meet by chance and if he could extend a helping hand he would.  This was a principle of Qing Shui and he would not request any repayment.  This was due to Qing Shui discovering that he had received the help of many people and furthermore it was always from people who he had never met before.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui did not head to the Qianyu Family and was prepared to head there only on this return trip, therefore he had only spent four days to reach the Di Family once again.\r\n\r\n “You’ve finished handling everything?”  being drawn by Qing Shui to sit on the sofa after enter the room, Di Chen gave a faint smile before asking Qing Shui.\r\n\r\n “Yes!”\r\n\r\n The relationship between Qing Shui and Di Chen had surged up many levels and it was possible for him to do more intimate actions with her.  Other than the previous occasion where he had rascally rubbed Di Chen’s breasts, he did not have a second opportunity yet.\r\n\r\n However Qing Shui did not wish to break the last level with her as Di Chen was seemingly very afraid of it.  At most she would allow Qing Shui to kiss her, however she did not allow him to break the last barrier with her.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui respected and loved her dearly and therefore did not make any strong requests of her.  The feeling of conditions between the both of them was perhaps not there yet.\r\n\r\n When this happened, Di Chen would automatically hug Qing Shui and ask him to give her slightly more time.  Only she knew that this was due to her training technique, which would not be good for her to lose her virginity at such a level…\r\n\r\n On the second day, Qing Shui and Di Chen said their goodbyes to the Di Family people before setting foot on the return path to Greencloud Continent.  Di Qing did not leave the Di Family, however during their parting she mentioned that she would come find Di Chen after a period of time.\r\n\r\n Giving a smile, Di Chen nodded her head and did not continue to talk about this, as she knew that it was best to let nature take its course.\r\n\r\n In two days, they arrived at the Qianyu Family.  Qianyu Dingjun, Qianyu He, Qianyu Qingqing, Qianyu Feifei and the rest gave them a warm welcome.  For the Qianyu Family, Nian Family as well as Madame Duanmu, Qing Shui had treated them as friends from his heart.  Due to their participation in the previous matter, it was enough to justify that.\r\n\r\n Qianyu Feifei seemingly had a special feeling for Qing Shui which was akin to that of a father.  Her life was given to her by Qing Shui, which made her trust in him no less than to her father, which was the person that she worshipped the most.  Now there was another, Qing Shui, and she had even regarded him as an elder brother, the kind that was akin to a father.\r\n\r\n He left a few small presents for Qianyu Feifei, which was the Five Elements Fruits, causing her clear and melodious laughter to be transmitted for quite long distance.  Upon seeing this, the people in the surroundings were very envious, however this kind of thing was unable to be mass produced.  Furthermore, the Five Elements of every person were different.\r\n\r\n Not long after leaving the Qingyu Family, Qing Shui arrived at the ten million kilometre wide wasteland.  This time however it was a relaxed matter for him as the speed of the Fire Bird was more than double its previous speed.  Coupled with the Nine Continent Steps, his speed had directly risen to approximately three fold as compared to before.  In the past he would require hundred days to cross it, however now he was able to accomplish that under fourteen days.\r\n\r\n “Chen Er, come over here and let your husband give you a hug!”  exclaimed Qing Shui with his arms spread open and a smile on his face as he stood on the Fire Bird.\r\n\r\n “Alright, stop it Qing Shui.”  said Di Chen as she shot an annoyed look at Qing Shui\r\n\r\n Qing Shui rubbed his nose and walked over while replying, “ If you don’t listen next time, I’ll have to treat you with the family rules?”\r\n\r\n “Family rules?  What family rules?”  asked Di Chen.  Hearing his words, she felt very happy, as she thought about them being already considered as a family.\r\n\r\n Pa!\r\n\r\n “This is family rules!” exclaimed Qing Shui has he gave a extremely gentle pat on Di Chen’s beautiful butt.  The sensation that he had felt once again gave him a shock within his spirit.\r\n\r\n “You hoodlum, you’re not allowed to bully me.”  snorted Di Chen with rage as she was drawn into Qing Shui’s embrace.  The previous pat was extremely soft and gentle, therefore she had only acted like that.\r\n\r\n “How could I bear to do that.”\r\n\r\n"

He now knew how formidable the Blood Sucking Night Bat King was.\r\n\r\n When the poison slowly disappeared, he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.  However at this moment, the poison that he thought he had already subdued came back even more ferociously.  It even caused a layer of ice to form on the surface of Qing Shui’s body.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui gently closed his eyes as the Fire Bird continued to fly!\r\n\r\n Di Chen was heartbroken when she felt the cold atmosphere and saw Qing Shui covered in ice as he stood there.\r\n\r\n She did not cry out because she could see that there was still a warmth emitted from Qing Shui’s head.  She knew that he was circulating his energy and did not dare to disturb him.  Instead, she just anxiously stood beside Qing Shui and looked at him.\r\n\r\n The Qi circulation of the Ancient Strengthening Technique got progressively slower, and only the Nature Energy and State of Immovable as Mountains counteracted the effects of the cold poison by a little.\r\n\r\n The Yin-Yang Image continued to slowly spin, it also helped to negate the cold poison and repaired the damages to his body.\r\n\r\n Qing Shui had been covered in ice for a long time.  When Di Chen saw the energy circulation in his body seem to stop, she recklessly decided to hug him.\r\n\r\n The bone-chilling cold did not bother her, she just tightly hugged Qing Shui’s frozen body.  Very soon, the bone chilling coldness seeped into her body and she felt that she was about to pass out.\r\n\r\n At that moment, she was shocked when she suddenly felt as if she entered another dimension.\r\n\r\n The dream among the sea of flowers!"

        "text":"This architecture presents itself far from civilization.  It offers travelers stripped-down accommodation, yet has everything they need after a long day’s hike.  The seven small cabins are arranged around a main house, forming an aesthetic place the rest and shelter.  The central building contains a kitchen and living area, designed to de open and inviting in order to enable harmonious togetherness among visitors.  Moreover, the structure has sleeping areas with room for up to 30 people.  On top of that, five guests can spend the night in each of the five sleeping cabins.\r\n A trip back to nature does not necessarily end on the trail.  The sauna located on the shores of the Soddadjorn lake includes washing areas where visitors can enjoy the spectacular surrounding under the open sky.  The water they need is fetched from the lake.  There is no electricity here, and the cabin is heated with wood gathered in the forest.  Lights is generated by energy from solar panels.\r\n The area’s unpredictable weather conditions meant that long assembly times were not possible here.  Therefore, the structures are made of prefabricated container modules.  The cabins structure autonomously, requiring neither monitoring nor maintenance.  Hikers tidy up the cabins and leave a small donation for their overnight accommodation – at their own direction.  This degree of self – sufficiency can be seen in the choice of robust materials.  The façade is clad with zinc, which can withstand wind and snow for decades.  Inside the cabins, wood predominates, which creates a cosy atmosphere.  Every cabin has glazed front that opens onto a panoramic view of picturesque scenery."

If I decrease the uncertainty of the position, so I decrease it to one, so the uncertainty in the momentum must increase to four, because one times four is equal to four.\r\n 2:10.\r\n If I decrease the uncertainty in the position even more, so if I lower that to point five, I increase the uncertainty in the momentum, that must go up to eight.\r\n 2:19.\r\n So point five times eight gives us four.\r\n 2:22.\r\n And so, what I'm trying to show you here, is as you decrease the uncertainty in the position, you increase the uncertainty in the momentum.\r\n 2:31.\r\n So another way of saying that is, the more accurately you know the position of a particle, the less accurately you know the momentum of that particle.\r\n 2:40.\r\n And that's the idea of the uncertainty principle.\r\n 2:44.\r\n And so let's apply this uncertainty principle to the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\r\n 2:49.\r\n So let's look at a picture of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.\r\n 2:52.\r\n Alright, we know our negatively charged electron orbits the nucleus, like a planet around the sun.\r\n 2:58.\r\n And, let's say the electron is going this direction, so there is a velocity associated with that electron, so there is velocity going in that direction.\r\n 3:08.\r\n Alright, the reason why the Bohr model is useful, is because it allows us to understand things like quantized energy levels.\r\n 3:14.\r\n"
