        "text":"Harper Steger smiled once rather grimly, even in the whirl of the financial chaos where smiles were few, as they were figuring it out.\r\n\r\n \"Frank,\" he said, \"you're a wonder.  You'll have a network of suits spread here shortly, which no one can break through.  They'll all be suing each other.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood smiled.\r\n\r\n \"I only want a little time, that's all,\" he replied.  Nevertheless, for the first time in his life he was a little depressed;  for now this business, to which he had devoted years of active work and thought, was ended.\r\n\r\n The thing that was troubling him most in all of this was not the five hundred thousand dollars which was owing the city treasury, and which he knew would stir political and social life to the center once it was generally known—that was a legal or semi-legal transaction, at least—but rather the matter of the sixty thousand dollars' worth of unrestored city loan certificates which he had not been able to replace in the sinking-fund and could not now even though the necessary money should fall from heaven.  The fact of their absence was a matter of source.  He pondered over the situation a good deal.  The thing to do, he thought, if he went to Mollenhauer or Simpson, or both (he had never met either of them, but in view of Butler's desertion they were his only recourse), was to say that, although he could not at present return the five hundred thousand dollars, if no action were taken against him now, which would prevent his resuming his business on a normal scale a little later, he would pledge his word that every dollar of the involved five hundred thousand dollars would eventually be returned to the treasury.  If they refused, and injury was done him, he proposed to let them wait until he was \"good and ready,\" which in all probability would be never.  But, really, it was not quite clear how action against him was to be prevented—even by them.  The money was down on his books as owing the city treasury, and it was down on the city treasury's books as owing from him.  Besides, there was a local organization known as the Citizens' Municipal Reform Association which occasionally conducted investigations in connection with public affairs.  His defalcation would be sure to come to the ears of this body and a public investigation might well follow.  Various private individuals knew of it already.  His creditors, for instance, who were now examining his books.\r\n\r\n This matter of seeing Mollenhauer or Simpson, or both, was important, anyhow, he thought;  but before doing so he decided to talk it all over with Harper Steger.  So several days after he had closed his doors, he sent for Steger and told him all about the transaction, except that he did not make it clear that he had not intended to put the certificates in the sinking-fund unless he survived quite comfortably.\r\n\r\n Harper Steger was a tall, thin, graceful, rather elegant man, of gentle voice and perfect manners, who walked always as though he were a cat, and a dog were prowling somewhere in the offing.  He had a longish, thin face of a type that is rather attractive to women.  His eyes were blue, his hair brown, with a suggestion of sandy red in it.  He had a steady, inscrutable gaze which sometimes came to you over a thin, delicate hand, which he laid meditatively over his mouth.  He was cruel to the limit of the word, not aggressively but indifferently;  for he had no faith in anything.  He was not poor.  He had not even been born poor.  He was just innately subtle, with the rather constructive thought, which was about the only thing that compelled him to work, that he ought to be richer than he was—more conspicuous.  Cowperwood was an excellent avenue toward legal prosperity.  Besides, he was a fascinating customer.  Of all his clients, Steger admired Cowperwood most.\r\n\r\n \"Let them proceed against you,\" he said on this occasion, his brilliant legal mind taking in all the phases of the situation at once.  \"I don't see that there is anything more here than a technical charge.  If it ever came to anything like that, which I don't think it will, the charge would be embezzlement or perhaps larceny as bailee.  In this instance, you were the bailee.  And the only way out of that would be to swear that you had received the check with Stener's knowledge and consent.  Then it would only be a technical charge of irresponsibility on your part, as I see it, and I don't believe any jury would convict you on the evidence of how this relationship was conducted.  Still, it might;  you never can tell what a jury is going to do.  All this would have to come out at a trial, however.  The whole thing, it seems to me, would depend on which of you two—yourself or Stener—the jury would be inclined to believe, and on how anxious this city crowd is to find a scapegoat for Stener.  This coming election is the rub.  If this panic had come at any other time—\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood waved for silence.  He knew all about that.  \"It all depends on what the politicians decide to do.  I'm doubtful.  The situation is too complicated.  It can't be hushed up.\"  They were in his private office at his house.  \"What will be will be,\" he added.\r\n\r\n \"What would that mean, Harper, legally, if I were tried on a charge of larceny as bailee, as you put it, and convicted?  How many years in the penitentiary at the outside?\"\r\n\r\n Steger thought a minute, rubbing his chin with his hand.  \"Let me see,\" he said, \"that is a serious question, isn't it?  The law says one to five years at the outside;  but the sentences usually average from one to three years in embezzlement cases.  Of course, in this case—\"\r\n\r\n \"I know all about that,\" interrupted Cowperwood, irritably.  \"My case isn't any different from the others, and you know it.  Embezzlement is embezzlement if the politicians want to have it so.\"  He fell to thinking, and Steger got up and strolled about leisurely.  He was thinking also.\r\n\r\n \"And would I have to go to jail at any time during the proceedings— before a final adjustment of the case by the higher courts?\"  Cowperwood added, directly, grimly, after a time.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, there is one point in all legal procedure of the kind,\" replied Steger, cautiously, now rubbing his ear and trying to put the matter as delicately as possible.  \"You can avoid jail sentences all through the earlier parts of a case like this;  but if you are once tried and convicted it's pretty hard to do anything—as a matter of fact, it becomes absolutely necessary then to go to jail for a few days, five or so, pending the motion for a new trial and the obtaining of a certificate of reasonable doubt.  It usually takes that long.\"\r\n\r\n The young banker sat there staring out of the window, and Steger observed, \"It is a bit complicated, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, I should say so,\" returned Frank, and he added to himself: \"Jail!  Five days in prison!\"  That would be a terrific slap, all things considered.  Five days in jail pending the obtaining of a certificate of reasonable doubt, if one could be obtained!  He must avoid this!  Jail! "

Lord Singleford's Rasper (purple cap, black\r\n sleeves).\r\n\r\n\r\n \"We scratched our other one and put all hopes on your word,\" said the Colonel.  \"Why, what is that?  Silver Blaze favourite?\"\r\n\r\n \"Five to four against Silver Blaze!\"  roared the ring.  \"Five to four against Silver Blaze!  Fifteen to five against Desborough!  Five to four on the field!\"\r\n\r\n \"There are the numbers up,\" I cried.  \"They are all six there.\"\r\n\r\n \"All six there!  Then my horse is running,\" cried the Colonel, in great agitation.  \"But I don't see him.  My colours have not passed.\"\r\n\r\n \"Only five have passed.  This must be he.\"\r\n\r\n As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing inclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of the Colonel.\r\n\r\n \"That's not my horse,\" cried the owner.  \"That beast has not a white hair upon its body.  What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, well, let us see how he gets on,\" said my friend, imperturbably.  For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.  \"Capital!  An excellent start!\"  he cried suddenly.  \"There they are, coming round the curve!\"\r\n\r\n From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight.  The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front.  Before they reached us, however, Desborough's bolt was shot, and the Colonel's horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival, the Duke of Balmoral's Iris making a bad third.\r\n\r\n \"It's my race anyhow,\" gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his eyes.  \"I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.  Don't you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n \"Certainly, Colonel.  You shall know everything.  Let us all go round and have a look at the horse together.  Here he is,\" he continued, as we made our way into the weighing inclosure where only owners and their friends find admittance.  \"You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.\"\r\n\r\n \"You take my breath away!\"\r\n\r\n \"I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of running him just as he was sent over.\"\r\n\r\n \"My dear sir, you have done wonders.  The horse looks very fit and well.  It never went better in its life.  I owe you a thousand apologies for having doubted your ability.  You have done me a great service by recovering my horse.  You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John Straker.\"\r\n\r\n \"I have done so,\" said Holmes, quietly.\r\n\r\n The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement.  \"You have got him!  Where is he, then?\"\r\n\r\n \"He is here.\"\r\n\r\n \"Here!  Where?\"\r\n\r\n \"In my company at the present moment.\"\r\n\r\n The Colonel flushed angrily.  \"I quite recognise that I am under obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but I must regard what you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.\"\r\n\r\n Sherlock Holmes laughed.  \"I assure you that I have not associated you with the crime, Colonel,\" said he;  \"the real murderer is standing immediately behind you!\"\r\n\r\n He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.\r\n\r\n \"The horse!\"  cried both the Colonel and myself.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, the horse.  And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence.  But there goes the bell;  and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a more lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.\" \r\n We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion's narrative of the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor training stables upon that Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.\r\n\r\n \"I confess,\" said he, \"that any theories which I had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous.  And yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import.  I went to Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete.\r\n \"It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer's house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me.  You may remember that I was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted.  I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.\"\r\n\r\n \"I confess,\" said the Colonel, \"that even now I cannot see how it helps us.\"\r\n\r\n \"It was the first link in my chain of reasoning.  Powdered opium is by no means tasteless.  The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible.  Were it mixed with any ordinary dish, the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more.  A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste.  By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer's family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour.  That is unthinkable.  Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case and our attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night.  The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill effects.  Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them?\r\n\r\n \"Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others.  The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though someone had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft.  Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.\r\n\r\n \"I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze.  For what purpose?  For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable-boy?  And yet I was at a loss to know why.  There have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by fraud.  Sometimes it is a pulling jockey.  Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means.  What was it here?  I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.\r\n\r\n \"And they did so.  You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man's hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon.  It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery.  And it was to be used for a delicate operation that night.  You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse's ham, and to do it subcutaneously so as to leave absolutely no trace.  A horse so treated would develop a slight lameness which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.\"\r\n\r\n \"Villain!  Scoundrel!\"  cried the Colonel.\r\n\r\n \"We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the horse out on to the moor.  So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife.  It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.\"\r\n\r\n \"I have been blind!\"  cried the Colonel.  \"Of course, that was why he needed the candle, and struck the match.\"\r\n\r\n \"Undoubtedly.  But in examining his belongings, I was fortunate enough to discover, not only the method of the crime, but even its motives.  As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people's bills about in their pockets.  We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own.  I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment.  The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes.  Liberal as you are with your servants, one hardly expects that they can buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their women.  I questioned Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner's address, and felt that by calling there with Straker's photograph, I could easily dispose of the mythical Darbyshire.\r\n\r\n \"From that time on all was plain.  Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible.  Simpson, in his flight, had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse's leg.  Once in the hollow he had got behind the horse, and had struck a light, but the creature, frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead.  He had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh.  Do I make it clear?\"\r\n \"Wonderful!\"  cried the Colonel.  \"Wonderful!  You might have been there.\"\r\n\r\n \"My final shot was, I confess, a very long one.  It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice.  What could he practise on?  My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.\"\r\n\r\n \"You have made it perfectly clear, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":" He merely stated, in his bland way, that he had been in the habit of borrowing money from the city treasury at a low rate of interest, and that this panic had involved him so that he could not possibly return it at present.\r\n\r\n \"I have heard rumors, Mr. Mollenhauer,\" he said, \"to the effect that some charge is to be brought against me as a partner with Mr. Stener in this matter;  but I am hoping that the city will not do that, and I thought I might enlist your influence to prevent it.  My affairs are not in a bad way at all, if I had a little time to arrange matters.  I am making all of my creditors an offer of fifty cents on the dollar now, and giving notes at one, two, and three years;  but in this matter of the city treasury loans, if I could come to terms, I would be glad to make it a hundred cents—only I would want a little more time.  Stocks are bound to recover, as you know, and, barring my losses at this time, I will be all right.  I realize that the matter has gone pretty far already.  The newspapers are likely to start talking at any time, unless they are stopped by those who can control them.\"  (He looked at Mollenhauer in a complimentary way.)  \"But if I could be kept out of the general proceedings as much as possible, my standing would not be injured, and I would have a better chance of getting on my feet.  It would be better for the city, for then I could certainly pay it what I owe it.\"  He smiled his most winsome and engaging smile.  And Mollenhauer seeing him for the first time, was not unimpressed.  Indeed he looked at this young financial David with an interested eye.  If he could have seen a way to accept this proposition of Cowperwood's, so that the money offered would have been eventually payable to him, and if Cowperwood had had any reasonable prospect of getting on his feet soon, he would have considered carefully what he had to say.  For then Cowperwood could have assigned his recovered property to him.  As it was, there was small likelihood of this situation ever being straightened out.  The Citizens' Municipal Reform Association, from all he could hear, was already on the move—investigating, or about to, and once they had set their hands to this, would unquestionably follow it closely to the end.\r\n\r\n \"The trouble with this situation, Mr. Cowperwood,\" he said, affably, \"is that it has gone so far that it is practically out of my hands.  I really have very little to do with it.  I don't suppose, though, really, it is this matter of the five-hundred-thousand-dollar loan that is worrying you so much, as it is this other matter of the sixty-thousand-dollar check you received the other day.  Mr. Stener insists that you secured that illegally, and he is very much wrought up about it.  The mayor and the other city officials know of it now, and they may force some action.  I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer was obviously not frank in his attitude—a little bit evasive in his sly reference to his official tool, the mayor;  and Cowperwood saw it.  It irritated him greatly, but he was tactful enough to be quite suave and respectful.\r\n\r\n \"I did get a check for sixty thousand dollars, that's true,\" he replied, with apparent frankness, \"the day before I assigned.  It was for certificates I had purchased, however, on Mr. Stener's order, and was due me.  I needed the money, and asked for it.  I don't see that there is anything illegal in that.\"\r\n\r\n \"Not if the transaction was completed in all its details,\" replied Mollenhauer, blandly.  \"As I understand it, the certificates were bought for the sinking-fund, and they are not there.  How do you explain that?\"\r\n\r\n \"An oversight, merely,\" replied Cowperwood, innocently, and quite as blandly as Mollenhauer.  \"They would have been there if I had not been compelled to assign so unexpectedly.  It was not possible for me to attend to everything in person.  It has not been our custom to deposit them at once.  Mr. Stener will tell you that, if you ask him.\"\r\n\r\n \"You don't say,\" replied Mollenhauer.  \"He did not give me that impression.  However, they are not there, and I believe that that makes some difference legally.  I have no interest in the matter one way or the other, more than that of any other good Republican.  I don't see exactly what I can do for you.  What did you think I could do?\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't believe you can do anything for me, Mr. Mollenhauer,\" replied Cowperwood, a little tartly, \"unless you are willing to deal quite frankly with me.  I am not a beginner in politics in Philadelphia.  I know something about the powers in command.  I thought that you could stop any plan to prosecute me in this matter, and give me time to get on my feet again.  I am not any more criminally responsible for that sixty thousand dollars than I am for the five hundred thousand dollars that I had as loan before it—not as much so.  I did not create this panic.  I did not set Chicago on fire.  Mr. Stener and his friends have been reaping some profit out of dealing with me.  I certainly was entitled to make some effort to save myself after all these years of service, and I can't understand why I should not receive some courtesy at the hands of the present city administration, after I have been so useful to it.  I certainly have kept city loan at par;  and as for Mr. Stener's money, he has never wanted for his interest on that, and more than his interest.\"\r\n\r\n \"Quite so,\" replied Mollenhauer, looking Cowperwood in the eye steadily and estimating the force and accuracy of the man at their real value.  \"I understand exactly how it has all come about, Mr. Cowperwood.  No doubt Mr. Stener owes you a debt of gratitude, as does the remainder of the city administration.  I'm not saying what the city administration ought or ought not do.  All I know is that you find yourself wittingly or unwittingly in a dangerous situation, and that public sentiment in some quarters is already very strong against you.  I personally have no feeling one way or the other, and if it were not for the situation itself, which looks to be out of hand, would not be opposed to assisting you in any reasonable way.  But how?  The Republican party is in a very bad position, so far as this election is concerned.  In a way, however innocently, you have helped to put it there, Mr, Cowperwood.  Mr. Butler, for some reason to which I am not a party, seems deeply and personally incensed.  And Mr. Butler is a great power here—\" (Cowperwood began to wonder whether by any chance Butler had indicated the nature of his social offense against himself, but he could not bring himself to believe that.  It was not probable.)  \"I sympathize with you greatly, Mr. Cowperwood, but what I suggest is that you first See Mr. Butler and Mr. Simpson.  If they agree to any program of aid, I will not be opposed to joining.  But apart from that I do not know exactly what I can do.  I am only one of those who have a slight say in the affairs of Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n At this point, Mollenhauer rather expected Cowperwood to make an offer of his own holdings, but he did not.  Instead he said, \"I'm very much obliged to you, Mr. Mollenhauer, for the courtesy of this interview.  I believe you would help me if you could.  I shall just have to fight it out the best way I can.  Good day.\"\r\n\r\n And he bowed himself out.  He saw clearly how hopeless was his quest.\r\n\r\n In the meanwhile, finding that the rumors were growing in volume and that no one appeared to be willing to take steps to straighten the matter out, Mr. Skelton C. Wheat, President of the Citizens' Municipal Reform Association, was, at last and that by no means against his will, compelled to call together the committee of ten estimable Philadelphians of which he was chairman, in a local committee-hall on Market Street, and lay the matter of the Cowperwood failure before it.\r\n\r\n \"It strikes me, gentlemen,\" he announced, \"that this is an occasion when this organization can render a signal service to the city and the people of Philadelphia, and prove the significance and the merit of the title originally selected for it, by making such a thoroughgoing investigation as will bring to light all the facts in this case, and then by standing vigorously behind them insist that such nefarious practices as we are informed were indulged in in this case shall cease.  I know it may prove to be a difficult task.  The Republican party and its local and State interests are certain to be against us.  Its leaders are unquestionably most anxious to avoid comment and to have their ticket go through undisturbed, and they will not contemplate with any equanimity our opening activity in this matter;  but if we persevere, great good will surely come of it.  There is too much dishonesty in public life as it is.  There is a standard of right in these matters which cannot permanently be ignored, and which must eventually be fulfilled.  I leave this matter to your courteous consideration.\"\r\n\r\n Mr. Wheat sat down, and the body before him immediately took the matter which he proposed under advisement.  It was decided to appoint a subcommittee \"to investigate\" (to quote the statement eventually given to the public) \"the peculiar rumors now affecting one of the most important and distinguished offices of our municipal government,\" and to report at the next meeting, which was set for the following evening at nine o'clock.  The meeting adjourned, and the following night at nine reassembled, four individuals of very shrewd financial judgment having meantime been about the task assigned them.  They drew up a very elaborate statement, not wholly in accordance with the facts, but as nearly so as could be ascertained in so short a space of time.\r\n\r\n \"It appears [read the report, after a preamble which explained why the committee had been appointed] that it has been the custom of city treasurers for years, when loans have been authorized by councils, to place them in the hands of some favorite broker for sale, the broker accounting to the treasurer for the moneys received by such sales at short periods, generally the first of each month.  In the present case Frank A. Cowperwood has been acting as such broker for the city treasurer.  But even this vicious and unbusiness-like system appears not to have been adhered to in the case of Mr. Cowperwood.  The accident of the Chicago fire, the consequent depression of stock values, and the subsequent failure of Mr. Frank A. Cowperwood have so involved matters temporarily that the committee has not been able to ascertain with accuracy that regular accounts have been rendered;  but from the manner in which Mr. Cowperwood has had possession of bonds (city loan) for hypothecation, etc., it would appear that he has been held to no responsibility in these matters, and that there have always been under his control several hundred thousand dollars of cash or securities belonging to the city, which he has manipulated for various purposes;  but the details of the results of these transactions are not easily available.  \"Some of the operations consisted of hypothecation of large amounts of these loans before the certificates were issued, the lender seeing that the order for the hypothecated securities was duly made to him on the books of the treasurer.  Such methods appear to have been occurring for a long time, and it being incredible that the city treasurer could be unaware of the nature of the business, there is indication of a complicity between him and Mr. Cowperwood to benefit by the use of the city credit, in violation of the law.\r\n\r\n \"Furthermore, at the very time these hypothecations were being made, and the city paying interest upon such loans, the money representing them was in the hands of the treasurer's broker and bearing no interest to the city.  The payment of municipal warrants was postponed, and they were being purchased at a discount in large amounts by Mr. Cowperwood with the very money that should have been in the city treasury.  The bona fide holders of the orders for certificates of loans are now unable to obtain them, and thus the city's credit is injured to a greater extent than the present defalcation, which amounts to over five hundred thousand dollars.  An accountant is now at work on the treasurer's books, and a few days should make clear the whole modus operandi.  It is hoped that the publicity thus obtained will break up such vicious practices.\"\r\n\r\n There was appended to this report a quotation from the law governing the abuse of a public trust;  and the committee went on to say that, unless some taxpayer chose to initiate proceedings for the prosecution of those concerned, the committee itself would be called upon to do so, although such action hardly came within the object for which it was formed.\r\n\r\n This report was immediately given to the papers.  Though some sort of a public announcement had been anticipated by Cowperwood and the politicians, this was, nevertheless, a severe blow.  Stener was beside himself with fear.  He broke into a cold sweat when he saw the announcement which was conservatively headed, \"Meeting of the Municipal Reform Association.\"  All of the papers were so closely identified with the political and financial powers of the city that they did not dare to come out openly and say what they thought.  The chief facts had already been in the hands of the various editors and publishers for a week and more, but word had gone around from Mollenhauer, Simpson, and Butler to use the soft pedal for the present.  It was not good for Philadelphia, for local commerce, etc., to make a row.  The fair name of the city would be smirched.  It was the old story.\r\n\r\n At once the question was raised as to who was really guilty, the city treasurer or the broker, or both.  How much money had actually been lost?  Where had it gone?  Who was Frank Algernon Cowperwood, anyway?  Why was he not arrested?  How did he come to be identified so closely with the financial administration of the city? "

        "text":"We live in globalised competitive world.  Today’s business has not been one mans show as it was few years back.   For any business to survive alliance is almost necessary.  Alliance may be in any form like partnership, joint venture, mergers & acquisitions.  This article would give a brief about partnership firm.\r\n What is partnership?\r\n In layman’s language its two or more persons coming together for common purpose.  Sec.  4 of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 defines partnership as “it is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any one of them acting for all.”  The persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called as partners & collectively known as firm.  The firm has not a legal entity in India.\r\n What are the essential elements of partnership?\r\n 1.   Association of two or more persons.\r\n There must be at least two or more persons to form a partnership.  The partnership act is silent about the maximum numbers of partners in a firm.  But the Indian Companies Act 1956 lays down that: (1) where the firm is carrying on banking business, the number of partners should not exceed 10, & (2) where the firm is carrying on any other business, the number of partners should not exceed 20.  If the number of maximum partners exceeds these limits, the partnership becomes illegal association of persons.\r\n 2.   Agreement between the persons.\r\n As per sec.5 of Partnership Act, the relation of partnership arises from contract & not from status.  The agreement of partnership may be expressed or implied.\r\n 3.   Business.\r\n Partnership can be formed only for the purpose of carrying on some business.  Sec.2 (b) Partnership Act defines as it includes every trade, occupation or profession.\r\n 4.   Sharing of Profits\r\n The sharing of profits is only a prima facie evidence of the existence of partnership and this is not the conclusive test of it.\r\n 5.   Business carried on by all or any one of them acting for all.\r\n The mutual agency relationship amongst the partners is the cardinal principle which governs partnership.  That means each partner is the agent of the firm as well as of the other partners.\r\n Who can become the partners?\r\n As per definition, “Partnership is an agreement.”  Therefore all persons who are competent to contract can become partners.  Sec.11 of the Indian Contract Act 1872 defines that “every person is competent to contract who is of the age of majority according to law to which he is subject and is of sound mind and is not disqualified from contracting by any law to which he is subject.”\r\n Types of Partnership\r\n Partnership can be classified:\r\n A.  Partnership at will (sec.7)\r\n A partnership is called partnership at will when (a) the partnership is not for fixed period of the time and (b) when no provision is made as to when and how the partnership will come to an end.  Partnership at will can be dissolved at any time when any partner chooses to do so after giving notice in writing to all other partners.  The firm is then dissolved from the date mentioned in the notice as the date of dissolution and if no such date is mentioned then from the date of communication of the notice.\r\n B.  Partnership for fixed period\r\n Where the partners agree to carry on its business for a definite term then the partnership is known as partnership for fixed period.\r\n C.  Particular Partnership\r\n Particular partnership is a partnership formed for a particular adventure or undertaking.  On completion of such undertaking or adventure the partnership is usually dissolved.  But if all the partner mutually agrees to continue partnership then it becomes partnership at will."

        "text":"A few thoughts on maintaining Responsive Sites\r\n November 29, 2011 Tagged: clients, design, media queries, responsive design\r\n\r\n It’s still relatively early days in my experience of developing and rolling out responsively designed websites.  One of the more recent ones, CEP Connect, was a phase 1 project which is currently entering its second phase.  This is, of course, involving changes to the design of the site: the addition of new elements, and adjustments to others.\r\n\r\n This has brought to light first hand, the impact that a responsively designed site might have on development time and cost when it comes to making changes down the track.\r\n\r\n\r\n In the past when I had changes to make to a site it was a simple job of adding the element to the markup,  and then styling it up.  Throw in a bit of browser testing to double check, but it was a pretty quick and seamless process.  Adding the same elements to a responsive design complicates this process quite markedly.\r\n\r\n Old vs New\r\n\r\n I personally favour a mobile-first approach - so my first step after getting the markup in place in is to set up the default styles for mobile users, and browsers that don’t support @media queries.  From there I work my way through the various breakpoints making sure everything scales appropriately and looks correct on the way to the largest @media query.  Then the final polishing is put into place for desktop and other larger-screen users.  Then throw in some browser testing, and we are ready to go.\r\n\r\n These extra steps are not a problem - they are actually quite important (and fulfilling) - but it is worth noting the extra development time this involves.  In the same way that there is an extra time consideration for the initial design of a responsive site, there needs to be extra time allowed for it’s maintenance and additions.\r\n\r\n A real-world example\r\n Time for a practical example: I was tasked with adding a secondary navigational element for users who are logged into a site.  A simple unordered list with 6 items does the trick and in the past some styles to get everything looking nice.  At a guess somewhere under half an hour to get everything polished and nice.\r\n\r\n By comparison, using the same markup but styling up the navigation to behave responsively like the rest of the site has come in a little over an hour in total.  Not a huge difference on a small item like that, but in reality it is a 100% increase in development time, which could be felt quite strongly on larger adjustments.\r\n\r\n Is it worth it?\r\n My hope is that a client who understands the benefits of a responsively designed site will likewise understand the reason for, and the benefit of, the added time (and therefore cost).  But anytime that money is involved, you can never be too sure.\r\n\r\n What experiences have you had maintaining and updating a responsively designed site?"

Kasson, a stocky, well-built, magnetic man of fifty, breathed an inward sigh of relief at the sight of it.\r\n\r\n \"I know it's hard, Mr. Cowperwood,\" he said, sympathetically.  \"We—and I can speak for the other members of the board—we feel keenly the unfortunate nature of your position.  We know exactly how it is that your son has become involved in this matter.  He is not the only banker who has been involved in the city's affairs.  By no means.  It is an old system.  We appreciate, all of us, keenly, the services you have rendered this institution during the past thirty-five years.  If there were any possible way in which we could help to tide you over the difficulties at this time, we would be glad to do so, but as a banker yourself you must realize just how impossible that would be.  Everything is in a turmoil.  If things were settled—if we knew how soon this would blow over—\" He paused, for he felt that he could not go on and say that he or the bank was sorry to be forced to lose Mr. Cowperwood in this way at present.  Mr. Cowperwood himself would have to speak.\r\n\r\n During all this Cowperwood, Sr., had been doing his best to pull himself together in order to be able to speak at all.  He had gotten out a large white linen handkerchief and blown his nose, and had straightened himself in his chair, and laid his hands rather peacefully on his desk.  Still he was intensely wrought up.\r\n\r\n \"I can't stand this!\"  he suddenly exclaimed.  \"I wish you would leave me alone now.\"\r\n\r\n Kasson, very carefully dressed and manicured, arose and walked out of the room for a few moments.  He appreciated keenly the intensity of the strain he had just witnessed.  The moment the door was closed Cowperwood put his head in his hands and shook convulsively.  \"I never thought I'd come to this,\" he muttered.  \"I never thought it.\"  Then he wiped away his salty hot tears, and went to the window to look out and to think of what else to do from now on. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXV\r\n\r\n As time went on Butler grew more and more puzzled and restive as to his duty in regard to his daughter.  He was sure by her furtive manner and her apparent desire to avoid him, that she was still in touch with Cowperwood in some way, and that this would bring about a social disaster of some kind.  He thought once of going to Mrs. Cowperwood and having her bring pressure to bear on her husband, but afterwards he decided that that would not do.  He was not really positive as yet that Aileen was secretly meeting Cowperwood, and, besides, Mrs. Cowperwood might not know of her husband's duplicity.  He thought also of going to Cowperwood personally and threatening him, but that would be a severe measure, and again, as in the other case, he lacked proof.  He hesitated to appeal to a detective agency, and he did not care to take the other members of the family into his confidence.  He did go out and scan the neighborhood of 931 North Tenth Street once, looking at the house;  but that helped him little.  The place was for rent, Cowperwood having already abandoned his connection with it.\r\n\r\n Finally he hit upon the plan of having Aileen invited to go somewhere some distance off—Boston or New Orleans, where a sister of his wife lived.  It was a delicate matter to engineer, and in such matters he was not exactly the soul of tact;  but he undertook it.  He wrote personally to his wife's sister at New Orleans, and asked her if she would, without indicating in any way that she had heard from him, write his wife and ask if she would not permit Aileen to come and visit her, writing Aileen an invitation at the same time;  but he tore the letter up.  A little later he learned accidentally that Mrs. Mollenhauer and her three daughters, Caroline, Felicia, and Alta, were going to Europe early in December to visit Paris, the Riviera, and Rome;  and he decided to ask Mollenhauer to persuade his wife to invite Norah and Aileen, or Aileen only, to go along, giving as an excuse that his own wife would not leave him, and that the girls ought to go.  It would be a fine way of disposing of Aileen for the present.  The party was to be gone six months.  Mollenhauer was glad to do so, of course.  The two families were fairly intimate.  Mrs. Mollenhauer was willing— delighted from a politic point of view—and the invitation was extended.  Norah was overjoyed.  She wanted to see something of Europe, and had always been hoping for some such opportunity.  Aileen was pleased from the point of view that Mrs. Mollenhauer should invite her.  Years before she would have accepted in a flash.  But now she felt that it only came as a puzzling interruption, one more of the minor difficulties that were tending to interrupt her relations with Cowperwood.  She immediately threw cold water on the proposition, which was made one evening at dinner by Mrs. Butler, who did not know of her husband's share in the matter, but had received a call that afternoon from Mrs. Mollenhauer, when the invitation had been extended.\r\n\r\n \"She's very anxious to have you two come along, if your father don't mind,\" volunteered the mother, \"and I should think ye'd have a fine time.  They're going to Paris and the Riveera.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, fine!\"  exclaimed Norah.  \"I've always wanted to go to Paris.  Haven't you, Ai?  Oh, wouldn't that be fine?\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't know that I want to go,\" replied Aileen.  She did not care to compromise herself by showing any interest at the start.  \"It's coming on winter, and I haven't any clothes.  I'd rather wait and go some other time.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, Aileen Butler!\"  exclaimed Norah.  \"How you talk!  I've heard you say a dozen times you'd like to go abroad some winter.  Now when the chance comes—besides you can get your clothes made over there.\"\r\n\r\n \"Couldn't you get somethin' over there?\"  inquired Mrs. Butler.  \"Besides, you've got two or three weeks here yet.\"\r\n\r\n \"They wouldn't want a man around as a sort of guide and adviser, would they, mother?\"  put in Callum.\r\n\r\n \"I might offer my services in that capacity myself,\" observed Owen, reservedly.\r\n\r\n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" returned Mrs. Butler, smiling, and at the same time chewing a lusty mouthful.  \"You'll have to ast 'em, my sons.\"\r\n\r\n Aileen still persisted.  She did not want to go.  It was too sudden.  It was this.  It was that.  Just then old Butler came in and took his seat at the head of the table.  Knowing all about it, he was most anxious to appear not to.\r\n\r\n \"You wouldn't object, Edward, would you?\"  queried his wife, explaining the proposition in general.\r\n\r\n \"Object!\"  he echoed, with a well simulated but rough attempt at gayety.  \"A fine thing I'd be doing for meself—objectin'.  I'd be glad if I could get shut of the whole pack of ye for a time.\"\r\n\r\n \"What talk ye have!\"  said his wife.  \"A fine mess you'd make of it livin' alone.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'd not be alone, belave me,\" replied Butler.  \"There's many a place I'd be welcome in this town—no thanks to ye.\"\r\n\r\n \"And there's many a place ye wouldn't have been if it hadn't been for me.  I'm tellin' ye that,\" retorted Mrs. Butler, genially.\r\n\r\n \"And that's not stretchin' the troot much, aither,\" he answered, fondly.\r\n\r\n Aileen was adamant.  No amount of argument both on the part of Norah and her mother had any effect whatever.  Butler witnessed the failure of his plan with considerable dissatisfaction, but he was not through.  When he was finally convinced that there was no hope of persuading her to accept the Mollenhauer proposition, he decided, after a while, to employ a detective.\r\n\r\n At that time, the reputation of William A. Pinkerton, of detective fame, and of his agency was great.  The man had come up from poverty through a series of vicissitudes to a high standing in his peculiar and, to many, distasteful profession;  but to any one in need of such in themselves calamitous services, his very famous and decidedly patriotic connection with the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln was a recommendation.  He, or rather his service, had guarded the latter all his stormy incumbency at the executive mansion.  There were offices for the management of the company's business in Philadelphia, Washington, and New York, to say nothing of other places.  Butler was familiar with the Philadelphia sign, but did not care to go to the office there.  He decided, once his mind was made up on this score, that he would go over to New York, where he was told the principal offices were.\r\n\r\n He made the simple excuse one day of business, which was common enough in his case, and journeyed to New York—nearly five hours away as the trains ran then—arriving at two o'clock.  At the offices on lower Broadway, he asked to see the manager, whom he found to be a large, gross-featured, heavy-bodied man of fifty, gray-eyed, gray-haired, puffily outlined as to countenance, but keen and shrewd, and with short, fat-fingered hands, which drummed idly on his desk as he talked.  He was dressed in a suit of dark-brown wool cloth, which struck Butler as peculiarly showy, and wore a large horseshoe diamond pin.  The old man himself invariably wore conservative gray.\r\n\r\n \"How do you do?\"  said Butler, when a boy ushered him into the presence of this worthy, whose name was Martinson—Gilbert Martinson, of American and Irish extraction.  The latter nodded and looked at Butler shrewdly, recognizing him at once as a man of force and probably of position.  He therefore rose and offered him a chair.\r\n\r\n \"Sit down,\" he said, studying the old Irishman from under thick, bushy eyebrows.  \"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n \"You're the manager, are you?\"  asked Butler, solemnly, eyeing the man with a shrewd, inquiring eye.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir,\" replied Martinson, simply.  \"That's my position here.\"\r\n\r\n \"This Mr. Pinkerton that runs this agency—he wouldn't be about this place, now, would he?\"  asked Butler, carefully.  \"I'd like to talk to him personally, if I might, meaning no offense to you.\"\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Pinkerton is in Chicago at present,\" replied Mr. Martinson.  \"I don't expect him back for a week or ten days.  You can talk to me, though, with the same confidence that you could to him.  I'm the responsible head here.  However, you're the best judge of that.\"\r\n\r\n Butler debated with himself in silence for a few moments, estimating the man before him.  \"Are you a family man yourself?\"  he asked, oddly.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir, I'm married,\" replied Martinson, solemnly.  \"I have a wife and two children.\"\r\n\r\n"
