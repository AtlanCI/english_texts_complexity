        "text":"Chris and Ian were waiting at the new apartment, but she wanted to turn on the alarm and lock up at Charles Street on her own.  A service was coming to clean the place up and make it sparkle for the new owners.  The realtor had arranged it, and Francesca didn’t need to be there.  But she wanted to say goodbye to the house.\r\n She wandered from room to room and remembered the good times they’d had there, and the bad ones.  She didn’t go upstairs to Eileen’s room, which was open and empty now.  But she went everywhere else.  And she smiled standing in the kitchen, remembering all the wonderful times and meals with Charles-Edouard and Marya.\r\n The house had served its purpose in its time, and Chris was right, she had loved it, and part of her still did and always would.  But like people, sometimes you had to let them go, and houses were no different.  It was a question of timing, of who belonged in your life when.  And she was letting this one go.  She stood in the front hall for the last time, and looked back at it as she set the alarm.  She punched in the numbers and locked the door.  She whispered goodbye and ran down the steps, and she took a cab to the apartment where Chris and Ian were waiting for her.  It was a whole new life with people she loved and who loved her.\r\n The apartment smelled delicious as she walked in.  Ian had baked her cookies.\r\n “Look what we made for you!”  Ian said, looking excited.  They were four-leaf clovers for St. Patrick’s Day, and he had sprinkled them green.\r\n “Those look like lucky cookies to me,” she said, and bent down to kiss him, and then she kissed Chris.  “And I am a very lucky woman,” she said to them both.  The pot had found its lid, just as Avery had said.  And she didn’t even have to go out looking for it.  It had found her.  She knew she had been right to fight to keep the house.  If she hadn’t, she would never have found Chris.  Everything had worked out just right, except for poor Eileen.  But there was nothing they could have done to save her.  Sometimes you just couldn’t.\r\n Francesca helped herself to one of the cookies, and looked around.  There were boxes everywhere.  They had tons to unpack, and a lot to do.  It was exciting to be here.  And more exciting still to be here with them.  Francesca had found her people and her place.  And it was no longer 44 Charles Street.  Charles Street was part of another time, another life, and now it was gone, to a family who would love it just as she had.  44 Charles Street was a chapter in her life, more than just a house.  The chapter was closed.  And a new one had begun.\r\n\r\n —  —  —  —  —  The end —  —  —  —  —  — -"

        "text":"Part I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Spock cannot prevent his lips from forming a thin line as Kirk swaggers into the conference room two minutes late for the briefing.  Kirk drops into the chair at the head of the table and, catching his disapproving gaze, has the audacity to raise an eyebrow  —  a gesture Kirk has mastered simply to mock him.  Spock raises an eyebrow as well.\r\n\r\n Four seconds pass before Doctor McCoy sighs in a long-suffering manner.  \"Can we please move on to the reason we're all here?  I have better things to do than watch you two have another staring contest.\"  He grumbles as an afterthought, \"Due respect, Captain.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk looks away first.  \"So,\" he says, glancing at the occupants of the room: Doctor McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Scott, Ensign Chekov, Lieutenant Sulu, Lieutenant Commander Robinson, Nyota, and, of course, Spock.  \"We’ve received new orders from Starfleet.\"  He takes an unnecessarily dramatic pause before continuing.  \"Our orders are to head for the Larunian system, to the planet Aten.  We're to rendezvous with the USS Excalibur, the USS Potemkin, and the USS Lexington there.\"  He pauses again and glances at everyone, as though to make certain that he is the center of the attention.\r\n\r\n If he were not Vulcan, Spock would be tempted to roll his eyes.  Kirk is such an attention-seeker.\r\n\r\n Mr. Chekov frowns.  \"Why, Keptin?\"\r\n\r\n Kirk smiles.  \"Starfleet is holding a tournament between the ships.  Each ship's crew has to choose a champion who will represent the ship in the tournament.  The winner of the tournament gets one million credits and his or her crew gets thirty days of additional shore leave!\"\r\n\r\n \"Wow, okay.  Cool!\"  Chekov says, exchanging a grin with Sulu.\r\n\r\n \"Aye, sounds it,\" Mr. Scott says, nodding.  \"What kind of a tournament is this?\"\r\n\r\n \"Um,\" Kirk starts, as eloquent as ever, and then blinks.  \"I'm not sure, actually – there's nothing about it in Starfleet's transmission.  I guess it’ll be the usual stuff   —   some kind of sport.\"\r\n\r\n Spock folds his hands before him on the table.  \"Captain, there are thousands of types of ‘sports.’  If you expect the crew to choose an adequate champion, we need to know for certain, so that crewmembers proficient at the sport could nominate themselves.\"\r\n\r\n \"It doesn't work like that, Mr. Spock,\" Kirk says very evenly, making Spock wary.  \"If you bothered to hear me out before starting to speak in such a condescending tone, you would have known that there would be no nominations.  Every crewmember will vote anonymously for someone who, in their opinion, would represent the ship the best.  The person who gets the most votes will be the champion of the ship.  Basically, it's a popularity contest.”  Kirk gives him a very sweet smile and claps him on the shoulder.  \"So you can relax and just enjoy the shore leave, Spock.\"\r\n\r\n Awkward silence descends upon the table.\r\n\r\n \"That wasn't passive-aggressive at all, kid,\" McCoy mutters under his breath.  Spock chooses to pretend that he cannot hear the doctor.  He will not give Kirk satisfaction by acknowledging Kirk's pathetic attempts to insult him.\r\n\r\n Mr. Sulu clears his throat.  \"But what if the chosen person doesn't want to participate?\"\r\n\r\n Kirk shrugs, averting his gaze from Spock.  \"He or she will just have to suck it up and deal with it.  It looks like all champions will be somehow... bound to participate.  I don't know the details;  we'll find out when we get to Aten.”  He considers his crew.  “Speaking of which, Mr. Chekov, you can go ahead and plot the course.\"\r\n\r\n \"Aye-aye, Captain!\"  The ensign starts quickly typing on his PADD.\r\n\r\n \"Bound?\"  McCoy repeats, a skeptical expression on his face.  It’s a rare occasion that Spock agrees with him, but this is one of those times.  \"Are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n Kirk chuckles.  \"Don't look at me like that.  They’re Starfleet's words, not mine.\"\r\n\r\n \"Actually,\" Nyota cuts in, looking thoughtful.  \"Aten has a very interesting reputation.  They say the planet is magical  —  \"\r\n\r\n \"Oh come on,\" McCoy says, snorting.  \"Magic doesn't exist.\"\r\n\r\n \"McCoy,\" Kirk warns.  \"Go on, Uhura.\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't know much,\" Nyota says, shrugging slightly.  \"Atenians are very private people, but ever since Aten joined the Federation two years ago, there’ve been a lot of rumors.  People who visited Aten tell all kinds of unbelievable things.  They say Atenians can do real magic, can read souls and people's desires  —  \"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, come on,\" Doctor McCoy says again, his lips twisting.  \"It's obvious that they made it all up.  Magic can't exist, because that's… it’s just ridiculous!\"  He snorts.  \"Next you'll say that they can prepare love potions and heal people with a flick of a wand.  Please.\"\r\n\r\n Pursing her lips, Nyota glowers at McCoy with an odd intensity, their gazes clashing.  \"Doctor, I'm merely repeating what I've heard.  Even if you're right, there has to be some basis for all the rumors, because rumors always have something that fuels them.  Believe the word of a communications expert, here.\"\r\n\r\n Spock eyes her thoughtfully, somewhat surprised.  Nyota rarely loses her temper so easily   —   it is one of the traits that she shares with his mother, and which he admires.\r\n\r\n \"The course has been plotted, Keptin!  At maximum warp we will arrive to Aten in three days and two hours!\"  Chekov says, smiling from ear to ear and oblivious to the tension between the CMO and CCO.\r\n\r\n \"Thank you, Mr. Chekov,\" Kirk says before glancing around the table, his gaze lingering on McCoy, Scott, Robinson, Nyota, and Spock.  \"I'll make an official ship-wide announcement, but make sure to give your people a talk.  You all are fully responsible for your subordinates' behaviors during the tournament.\"\r\n\r\n \"I presume that applies to you as well, Captain?\"  Spock says politely.\r\n\r\n A muscle in Kirk's jaw twitches.  \"Of course, Commander,\" he says just as politely, his smile looking like a grimace as he kicks Spock under the table.  \"I'll take a full responsibility for the Tactics and Strategy department.\"\r\n\r\n He will not kick Kirk back.  He is an adult.\r\n\r\n \"Any questions?\"  Kirk says, glancing at everyone.  When none are voiced, he smiles.  \"Good.\"  Looking straight at Spock, he drawls out, \"Dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n Spock stands up and follows everyone – except McCoy, who remains in his seat – out of the room, aware that his back is rigidly straight.  The way Kirk says the word 'dismissed' never fails to...infuriate him, as if he is something that can be easily discarded.  It is distasteful that he lets Kirk anger him so, but Spock has long ago given up denying that he is prone to that particular emotion too easily when it comes to Kirk.\r\n\r\n The door of the briefing room slides shut behind him, and Spock's steps falter as McCoy's muffled voice reaches his ears.  He is speaking very quietly and quickly, and so Spock is able to catch only his own name and the words \"childish,\" \"mean,\" and \"downright pathetic, kid.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk, however, raises his voice enough for Spock to hear him.  \"Bones, I know  —  I know, okay?  He's just  —   He's fucking driving me crazy!  In his book, I'm always wrong, I always suck, I'm never good enough.  He just looks at me with that expression like I'm some bug  —   And it's like I'm thirteen all over again.  I'm trying to be the better person, really  —  hell, I know I'm a better person, but when it's him, I just can't.  I can't, okay?\"\r\n\r\n McCoy sighs heavily.  \"All right, don't beat yourself over it.  It’s a two-way street, and I don’t see the hobgoblin givin’ much from his end.\"\r\n\r\n Ridiculous, Spock thinks as he walks to the turbolift, but it is not the first time he has heard this particular opinion.  Thanks to Kirk, approximately 89.21% of the crew is of the erroneous opinion that he is the one to blame for the tension between him and Kirk.\r\n\r\n Kirk.  Even after five months of serving under him, Spock cannot make himself think of him as 'the Captain.'  When he looks at Kirk, he cannot see an authority figure;  he sees the obnoxious, infuriating Cadet who hacked into his program and the manipulative trespasser who emotionally compromised him in front of the crew.\r\n\r\n When he applied to the Enterprise, he had thought he would adjust to Kirk's being his commanding officer, but he has not.  He simply cannot detach himself and make their interactions impersonal and purely professional.  He wishes to, but Kirk does not allow him that privilege and remains his obnoxious, petulant self.  Kirk is no better than those Vulcan bullies from his childhood: he enjoys pushing Spock's boundaries, intruding into his personal space, and goading him into an emotional reaction.\r\n\r\n The most distasteful thing is that Spock appears to be the only one who can see Kirk's true nature.  The crew admires their captain, constantly complimenting him on his bravery (foolishness), quick thinking (impulsiveness), and intelligence (here, Spock has to agree, but being intelligent is not the same as being smart).\r\n\r\n Kirk is  —  \r\n\r\n \"…Spock!  Are you even listening to me?\"\r\n\r\n Spock looks aside and finds Nyota walking alongside with him.\r\n\r\n \"Now I am,\" he says.  They enter the turbolift together.  \"Do you intend to spend the night in my quarters?\"\r\n\r\n She smiles.  \"Why?  You have some ideas?\"\r\n\r\n Spock says nothing, because it does not deserve an answer.  He will never understand why humans insist on giving serious questions sexual meanings.\r\n\r\n\r\n ~*~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Settling against his pillow, he watches Nyota undress for the night.\r\n\r\n She winks at him.  \"Like what you see?\"\r\n\r\n Spock raises an eyebrow.\r\n\r\n Chuckling, Nyota unhooks her bra, leaving her chest bare.  She is very aesthetically pleasing, her small breasts round and high, but Spock's penis stays limp.  He has no intention of having sexual intercourse tonight;  they engaged in a session two days ago, and the recommended interval between sexual acts for Vulcans is three standard days.\r\n\r\n Sighing in relief, Nyota strokes her freed breasts, giving him a sly look and a brilliant smile.  Spock raises his eyebrow higher, somewhat amused.  While it is true that Nyota's actions interest him on some level, he has no intention of allowing himself to become truly aroused.  It never ceases to amaze him that even Nyota, for all her excellent knowledge of Vulcan culture, does not understand that Spock acquires an erection only when he wishes to acquire an erection, and that no amount of seduction will work if Spock does not allow it.\r\n\r\n Humans are such peculiar creatures.\r\n\r\n Spock closes his eyes.  \"I will sleep for approximately four hours.  You are welcome to stay if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n Nyota goes silent.\r\n\r\n \"God, you’re serious.  You're going to sleep when I'm here?\"\r\n\r\n Spock suppresses the urge to sigh.  He is very fond of Nyota  —   she is smart, beautiful, kind, and understanding   —   but he finds that it was easier to talk to her when they were merely friends.  Maintaining a romantic relationship has been more tiresome than he expected.\r\n\r\n Spock looks at her.  \"Yes,\" he says, willing his voice to sound softer, because she is human and so requires such signs of affection.  \"Come into the bed, Nyota.  If you wish, we may have sexual intercourse tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n She gives him an odd look before shaking her head to herself and climbing into the bed.  She maintains the two feet between them, as required by Spock;  she knows better than to attempt to initiate 'cuddling.'  Spock has informed her on numerous occasions that he finds human bodies too cool for such an activity, even if he wished to   —   which he does not.\r\n\r\n Ordering the lights off, Spock closes his eyes.  Truth to be told, even after a year of being in a relationship with Nyota, he still cannot comprehend why independent individuals bother with maintaining romantic relationships, voluntarily restricting their freedom and adjusting to their partner's habits and whims.\r\n\r\n Spock thinks of his mother and father.  You once asked me why I married your mother.  I married her because I loved her.\r\n\r\n Is what he feels for Nyota… love?  Was it like this for his parents, as well?\r\n\r\n He thinks of the way his mother used to look at Father and wonders.\r\n\r\n Soon, he sleeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n ~*~\r\n\r\n\r\n He dreams of doing his paperwork.\r\n\r\n He hears the door to his cabin slide open, but he does not lift his head.  Three seconds later, a PADD is slammed on his desk with such force that Spock nearly flinches.\r\n\r\n \"Explain what the fuck this is,\" a familiar voice growls out, and only then, Spock lifts his head.\r\n\r\n He meets Kirk's angry gaze.\r\n\r\n \"I believe this is a PADD.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk flushes with rage.  \"I hadn’t noticed.\"\r\n\r\n \"I do not understand what you wish for me to say,\" Spock says evenly  —  or attempts to, because his heartbeat is speeding up for no apparent reason and he has to apply a calming meditation technique to control his impulses.  I am agitated, Spock realizes, with the most bizarre sensation of watching the scene unfold from an outsider's point of view.\r\n\r\n And then he realizes that it is not merely a dream   —   it is a memory of the argument they had twenty-eight days into the Enterprise's official mission.\r\n\r\n Kirk leans over the desk so that he is looming over Spock.  \"Oh yeah?  So it isn't you who marked my report to the Admiralty as 'insufficient and juvenile'?\"\r\n\r\n Spock stares at him.  \"I did indeed mark your report as insufficient and juvenile, and advised you to rewrite it.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk glowers at him.  \"I spent four hours of my off time writing it!\"\r\n\r\n Spock raises an eyebrow.  \"How is this relevant to the fact that it is insufficient and juvenile?\"\r\n\r\n \"Fuck you,\" Kirk spits out.  \"Christ.  I don't give a damn if my reports aren't up to your standards.\"\r\n\r\n Spock slowly stands up;  now they are face to face.  \"Then why are you here, Captain?  You have the freedom to simply ignore my advice if you wish.  You choose to do so ninety-three percent of the time.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk glares.  \" 'Advice,' my ass.  Making fun of my hard work isn't fucking advice!  And who said that you could be the judge of what is 'sufficient' and what's not?  You think you're so smart, huh?  Do I need to remind you that if we did it your way, Earth would have been destroyed, too? \"\r\n\r\n Spock flinches.\r\n\r\n Kirk smirks. "

If each owner had kept Caesura for ten years, and it had never sat idle for longer than a day or two, that meant Caesura was, at a very conservative estimate, more than two thousand years old.\r\n\r\n I received my next surprise three hours later when I tried to excuse myself for supper.  As I stood to leave Magwyn explained I was to remain with her until I learned all of Caesura’s story by heart.  Someone would bring us our meals, and there was a room nearby where I could sleep.\r\n First came Chael . . ."

        "text":" No!  Of course not!”\r\n “Are you certain?”\r\n “I have studied at the Medica,” I said somewhat stiffly.  “The greatest school of medicine in all the world.  I know all about the diseases a person might catch, how to spot them and how to treat them.”\r\n Penthe gave me a skeptical look.  “I do not question you in particular.  But it is well known that barbarians are quite frequently diseased in their sex.”\r\n I shook my head.  “This is just another foolish story.  I assure you the barbarians are no more diseased than the Adem.  In fact, I expect we may be less.”\r\n She shook her head, her eyes serious.  “No.  You are wrong in this.  Of a hundred barbarians, how many would you say were so afflicted?”\r\n It was an easy statistic I knew from the Medica.  “Out of every hundred?  Perhaps five.  More among those who work in brothels or frequent such places, of course.”\r\n Penthe’s face showed obvious disgust and she shivered.  “Of one hundred Adem, none are so afflicted,” she said firmly.  Absolute.\r\n “Oh come now.”  I held up my hand, making a circle with my fingers.  “None?”\r\n “None,” she said with grim certainty.  “The only place we could catch such a thing is from a barbarian, and those who travel are warned.”\r\n “What if you caught a disease from another Adem who had not been careful while traveling?”  I asked.\r\n Penthe’s tiny heart-shaped face went grim, her nostrils flaring.  “From one of my own?”  Vast anger.  “If one of Ademre were to give me a disease, I would be furious.  I would shout from the top of a cliff what they had done.  I would make their life as painful as a broken bone.”\r\n She gestured disgust, brushing at the front of her shirt in the first piece of Adem hand-talk I had ever learned from Tempi.  “Then I would make the long trek over the mountains into the Tahl to be cured of it.  Even if the trip should take two years and bring no money to the school.  And none would think the less of me for that.”\r\n I nodded to myself.  It made sense.  Given their attitudes about sex, if it were any other way, disease would run rampant through the population.\r\n I saw Penthe looking at me expectantly.  “Thank you for the flowers,” I said.\r\n She nodded and stepped closer, looking up at me.  Her eyes were excited as she smiled her shy smile.  Then her face grew serious.  “Is it enough to satisfy your barbarian rituals, or is there more that must be done?”\r\n I reached down and ran my hand along the smooth skin of her neck, sliding my fingertips under the long braid so they brushed the back of her neck.  She closed her eyes and tipped her face up toward mine.\r\n “They are lovely, and more than enough,” I said, and bent to kiss her.\r\n\r\n “I was right,” Penthe said with a contented sigh as we lay naked among the flowers.  “You have a fine anger.”  I lay on my back, her small body curled under my arm, her heart-shaped face resting gently on my chest.\r\n “What do you mean by that?”  I asked.  “I think anger might be the wrong word.”\r\n “I mean Vaevin,” she said, using the Ademic term.  “Is that the same?”\r\n “I don’t know that word,” I admitted.\r\n “I think anger is the right word,” she said.  “I have spoken with Vashet in your language, and she did not correct me.”\r\n “What do you mean by anger, then?”  I asked.  “I certainly don’t feel angry.”\r\n Penthe lifted her head from my chest and gave me a lazy, satisfied smile.  “Of course not,” she said.  “I have taken your anger.  How could you feel such a way?”\r\n “Are . . .  are you angry then?”  I asked, sure I was missing the point entirely.\r\n Penthe laughed and shook her head.  She had undone her long braid and her honey-colored hair hung down the side of her face.  It made her look like an entirely different person.  That and the lack of the mercenary reds, I supposed.  “It is not that kind of anger.  I am glad to have it.”\r\n “I still do not understand,” I said.  “This could be something barbarians do not know.  Explain it to me as if I were a child.”\r\n She looked at me for a moment, her eyes serious, then she rolled over onto her stomach so she could face me more easily.  “This anger is not a feeling.  It is . .  .”  She hesitated, frowning prettily.  “It is a desire.  It is a making.  It is a wanting of life.”\r\n Penthe looked around, then focused on the grass around us.  “Anger is what makes the grass press up through the ground to reach the sun,” she said.  “All things that live have anger.  It is the fire in them that makes them want to move and grow and do and make.”  She cocked her head.  “Does that make sense to you?”\r\n “I think so,” I said.  “And women take the anger from men in sex?”\r\n She smiled, nodding.  “That is why afterward a man is so weary.  He gives a piece of himself.  He collapses.  He sleeps.”  She glanced down.  “Or a part of him sleeps.”\r\n “Not for long,” I said.\r\n “That is because you have a fine, strong anger,” she said proudly.  “As I have already said.  I can tell because I have taken a piece of it.  I can tell there is more waiting.”\r\n “There is,” I admitted.  “But what do women do with the anger?”\r\n “We use it,” Penthe said simply.  “That is why, afterward, a woman does not always sleep as a man does.  She feels more awake.  Full of the need to move.  Often full of desire for more of what brought her the anger in the first place.”  She lowered her head to my chest and bit me playfully, wriggling her naked body against me.\r\n It was pleasantly distracting.  “Does this mean women have no anger of their own?”\r\n She laughed again.  “No.  All things have anger.  But women have many uses for their anger.  And men have more anger than they can use, too much for their own good.”\r\n “How can one have too much of the desire to live and grow and make?”  I asked.  “It seems more would be better.”\r\n Penthe shook her head, brushing her hair back with one hand.  “No.  It is like food.  One meal is good.  Two meals is not better.”  She frowned again.  “No.  It is more like wine.  One cup of wine is good, two is sometimes better, but ten . .  .”  She nodded seriously.  “That is very much like anger.  A man who grows full of it, it is like a poison in him.  He wants too many things.  He wants all things.  He becomes strange and wrong in his head, violent.”\r\n She nodded to herself.  “Yes.  That is why anger is the right word, I think.  You can tell a man who has been keeping all his anger to himself.  It goes sour in him.  It turns against itself and drives him to breaking rather than making.”\r\n “I can think of men like that,” I said.  “But I can think of women too.”\r\n “All things have anger,” she repeated with a shrug.  “A stone does not have much compared to a budding tree.  It is the same with people.  Some have more, or less.  Some use it wisely.  Some do not.”  She gave me a wide smile.  “I have a great deal, which is why I am so fond of sex and fierce in my fighting.”  She bit at my chest again, less playfully this time, and began to work her way up to my neck.\r\n “But if you take the anger from a man in sex,” I said, struggling to concentrate, “doesn’t that mean the more sex you have, the more you want?”\r\n “It is like the water one uses to prime a pump,” she said hotly against my ear.  “Come now, I will have all of it, even if it takes us all day and half the night.”\r\n\r\n We eventually moved from the grassy field to the baths, and then to Penthe’s house of two snug rooms built against the side of a bluff.  The moon was in the sky and had been watching us for some time through the window, though I doubt we showed her anything she hadn’t seen before.\r\n “Is that enough for you?”  I said breathlessly.  We were side by side in her pleasantly capacious bed, the sweat drying off our bodies.  “If you take much more of it, I might not have enough anger left to speak or breathe.”\r\n My hand lay on the flat plane of her belly.  Her skin was soft and smooth, but when she laughed I could feel the muscles of her stomach jump, going hard as sheets of steel.\r\n “It is enough for now,” she said, exhaustion plain in her voice.  “It would upset Vashet if I left you empty as a fruit with all the juice pressed out.”\r\n Despite my long day, I was oddly wakeful, my thoughts bright and clear.  I remembered something she had said earlier.  “You mentioned that a woman has many uses for her anger.  What use does a woman have for it that a man does not?”\r\n “We teach,” she said.  “We give names.  We track the days and tend to the smooth turning of things.  We plant.  We make babies.”  She shrugged.  “Many things.”\r\n “A man can do those things as well,” I said.\r\n Penthe chuckled.  “You have the wrong word,” she said, rubbing at my chin.  “A beard is what a man makes.  A baby is something different, and that you have no part of.”\r\n “We don’t carry the baby,” I said, slightly offended.  “But still, we play our part in making it.”\r\n Penthe turned to look at me, smiling as if I had made a joke.  Then her smile faded.  She propped herself up on her elbow and looked at me for another long moment.  “Are you in serious?”\r\n Seeing my perplexed expression, her eyes grew wide with amazement and she sat upright on the bed.  “It is true!”  she said.  “You believe in man-mothers!”  She giggled, covering the bottom half of her face with both hands.  “I never believed it was true!”  She lowered her left hand, revealing an excited grin as she gestured amazed delight.\r\n I felt I should be irritated, but I couldn’t quite muster the energy.  Perhaps some of what she said about men giving away their anger had some truth to it.  “What is a man-mother?”  I asked.\r\n “Are you not making a joke?”  she asked, one hand still half-covering her smile.  “Do you truly believe a man puts a baby in a woman?”\r\n “Well . . .  yes,” I said a little awkwardly.  “In a manner of speaking.  It takes a man and a woman to make a baby.  A mother and a father.”\r\n “You have a word for it!”  she said, delighted.  “They told me this too.  With the stories of dirt soup.  But I never thought it a real story!”\r\n I sat up myself at this point, growing concerned.  “You do know how babies are made, don’t you?”  I asked, gesturing serious earnestness.  “What we have been doing for most of the day is what makes a baby.”\r\n She looked at me for a moment in stunned silence, then dissolved helplessly into laughter, trying to speak several times only to have it overwhelm her again when she looked up at the expression on my face.\r\n Penthe put her hands on her belly, prodding it as if puzzled.  “Where is my baby?”  She looked down at her flat belly.  “Perhaps I have been sexing wrong these years.”  When she laughed, the muscles across her stomach flickered, making a pattern like a turtle’s shell.  “I should have a hundred babies if what you say is true.  Five hundred babies!”\r\n “It does not happen every time there is sex,” I said.  “There are only certain times when a woman is ripe for a baby.”\r\n “And have you done this?”  she asked, looking at me with mock seriousness while a smile tugged at her mouth.  “Have you made a baby with a woman?”\r\n “I have been careful not to do such a thing,” I said.  “There is an herb called silphium.  I chew it every day, and it keeps me from putting a baby in a woman.”\r\n Penthe shook her head.  “This is more of your barbarian sex rituals,” she said.  “Does bringing a man to the flowers also make a baby where you come from?”\r\n I decided to take a different tack.  “If men do not help with making babies, how do you explain that babies look like their fathers?”\r\n “Babies look like angry old men,” Penthe said.  “All bald and with . .  .”  She hesitated, touching her cheek.  “. . .  with face lines.  Perhaps the old men are the only ones making babies then?”  She smirked.\r\n “What about kittens?”  I asked.  “You have seen a litter of kittens.  When a white cat and a black cat have sex, you get kittens both white and black.  And kittens of both colors.”\r\n “Always?”  she asked.\r\n “Not always.”  I admitted.  “But most times.”\r\n “What if there is a yellow kitten?”  she asked.\r\n Before I could put together an answer, she waved the question away.  “Kittens have little to do with this,” she said.  “We are not like animals.  We do not go into season.  We do not lay eggs.  We do not make cocoons, or fruit, or seeds.  We are not dogs or frogs or trees.”\r\n Penthe gave me a serious look.  “You are committing a false thinking.  You could as easily say two stones make baby stones by banging against each other until a piece breaks off.  Therefore two people make baby peoples in the same way.”\r\n I fumed, but she was right.  I was committing a fallacy of analogy.  It was faulty logic.\r\n Our conversation continued along this vein for some time.  I asked her if she had ever known a woman to get pregnant who had not had sex in the previous months.  She said she didn’t know of any woman who would willingly go three months without sex, except those who were traveling among the barbarians, or very ill, or very old.\r\n Eventually Penthe waved a hand to stop me, gesturing exasperation.  “Do you hear your own excuses?  Sex makes babies, but not always.  Babies look like man-mothers, but not always.  The sex must be at the right time, but not always.  There are plants that make it more likely, or less likely.”  She shook her head.  “You must realize what you say is thin as a net.  You keep sewing new threads, hoping it will hold water.  But hoping does not make it true.”\r\n Seeing me frown, she took my hand and gestured comfort into it as she had before in the dining hall, all the laughter gone out of her face.  “I can see you think this truly.  I can understand why barbarian men would want to believe it.  It must be comforting to think you are important in this way.  But it is simply not.”\r\n Penthe looked at me with something close to pity.  “Sometimes a woman ripens.  It is a natural thing, and men have no part in it.  That is why more women ripen in the fall, like fruit.  That is why more women ripen here in Haert, where it is better to have a child.”\r\n I tried to think of some other convincing argument, but none would come to mind.  It was frustrating.\r\n Seeing my expression, Penthe squeezed my hand and gestured concession.  “Perhaps it is different for barbarian women,” she said.\r\n “You are only saying that to make me feel better,” I said sullenly and was overcome with a jaw-popping yawn.\r\n “I am,” she admitted.  Then she gave me a gentle kiss and pushed at my shoulders, encouraging me to lie back down on the bed.\r\n I did, and she nestled into the crook of my arm again, resting her head on my shoulder.  “It must be hard to be a man,” she said softly.  “A woman knows she is part of the world.  We are full of life.  A woman is the flower and the fruit.  We move through time as part of our children.  But a man . .  .”  She turned her head and looked up at me with gentle pity in her eyes.  “You are an empty branch.  You know when you die, you will leave nothing of any import behind.”\r\n Penthe stroked my chest fondly.  “I think that is why you are so full of anger.  Maybe you do not have more than women.  Maybe the anger in you simply has no place to go.  Maybe it is desperate to leave some mark.  It hammers at the world.  It drives you to rash action.  To bickering.  To rage.  You paint and build and fight and tell stories that are bigger than the truth.”\r\n She gave a contented sigh and rested her head on my shoulder, snugging herself firmly into the circle of my arm.  “I am sorry to tell you this thing.  You are a good man, and a pretty thing.  But still, you are only a man.  All you have to offer the world is your anger.”\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT Names\r\n It was the day that I would either stay or leave.  I sat with Vashet on a green hill, watching the sun rise out of the clouds to the east.\r\n “Saicere means to fly, to catch, to break,” Vashet said softly, repeating herself for the hundredth time.  “You must remember all the hands that have held her.  Many hands, all following the Lethani.  You must never use her in an improper way.”\r\n “I promise,” I said for the hundredth time, then hesitated before bringing up something that had been bothering me.  “But Vashet, you used your sword to trim the willow branch you beat me with.  I saw you use it to hold your window open once.  You pare your nails with it . .  .”\r\n Vashet gave me a blank look.  “Yes?”\r\n “Isn’t that improper?”  I asked.\r\n She cocked her head, then laughed.  “You mean I should only use it for fighting?”\r\n I gestured obvious implication.\r\n “A sword is sharp,” she said.  “It is a tool.  I carry it constantly, how is using it improper?”\r\n “It seems disrespectful,” I clarified.\r\n “You respect a thing by putting it to good use,” she said.  “It may be years before I return to the barbarian lands and fight.  How does it harm my sword if it cuts kindling and carrots in the meantime?”  Vashet’s eyes grew serious.  “To carry a sword your whole life, knowing it was only for killing . .  .”  She shook her head.  “What would that do to a person’s mind?  It would be a horrible thing.”\r\n Vashet had returned to Haert last night, dismayed that she had missed my stone trial. "

We were burning down forests for crops and stoking\r\nforges with lumber.  When the industrial revolution began, there was a lack of wood and some clever guys\r\nstumbled upon the idea of using coal, then came the turn of oil and gas, but they are also about to run out.\r\n Although some attempts were made to switch over to nuclear energy.  The atom is much more difficult than it seemed.\r\n AND NOW WHAT?\r\n We have raked out from the earth all we could, but  it was not enough!  We want more and more and more!\r\n Cities are turned into garbage heaps.  Rivers are polluted seas are poisoned.  We have contrived to leave \r\nwaste in space.  Dropped it at the bottom of the ocean.  Made holes in the ozone layer.  Sh. . ed up the air!\r\n DO YOU KNOW WHO IS TO BLAME?  It is for you the oil is produced, so, you can drive your an a big new car.\r\n It is for you the products imported from other continents.  And of course each comes in packaging, which will\r\nbe burnt  and it all end up in the atmosphere. \r\n In the End you are the reason for GLOBAL WARMING, but you will start thinking about it after ANTARCTICA or GREENLAND melt even more.  It is going to hit you only when New York, London, Amsterdam and hundreds of other cities are flooded the water reaches your house.\r\n TELL ME WHAT makes you better than a monkey?  NOTHING!  It want the same things to be safe and feel\r\nno hunger.  Unlike you in order to satisfy it is needs the monkey does not have to demolish all living things\r\naround it.\r\n Doesn't sound good.  DOES IT?\r\n So, change yourself.  Carpool to work.  Shop only for  local goods.  Use fluorescent bulbs and other energy\r\nsaving appliances.  Start switching off the TV and computer when not using them. \r\n That's how you'll reduce the consumption of power by eighty percent.  Get together with your neighbors to\r\ninstall wind turbines or solar panels.\r\n AT LEAST DO SOMETHING!   GO!"
