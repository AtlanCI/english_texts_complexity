        "text":"She said I was right to lay aside my sword when Carceret did, and that I had made her proud.\r\n Yesterday, Shehyn had formally invited me to stay and train at the school.  In theory, I already had earned that right, but everyone knew that was more of a political fiction than anything.  Her offer was a flattering one, an opportunity I knew I would likely never have again.\r\n We watched a boy herd a flock of goats down the side of a hill.  “Vashet, is it true that the Adem have no concept of fatherhood?”\r\n Vashet nodded easily, then paused.  “Tell me you did not embarrass both of us by talking about this with everyone while I was gone,” she said with a sigh.\r\n “Only with Penthe,” I said.  “She thought it was the funniest thing she had heard in ten months’ time.”\r\n “It is fairly amusing at that,” Vashet said, her mouth curving a little.\r\n “It’s true then?”  I asked.  “Even you believe this?  You’ve . .  .”\r\n Vashet held up a hand and I trailed off.  “Peace,” she said.  “Think whatever you wish about your man-mothers.  It is all the same to me.”  She gave a soft smile of remembrance.  “My poet king actually believed a woman was nothing more than the ground in which a man might plant a baby.”\r\n Vashet made an amused huffing sound that wasn’t quite a laugh.  “He was so sure he was right.  Nothing could sway him.  Years ago I decided arguing such things with a barbarian is a long, weary waste of my time.”  She shrugged.  “Think what you want about making babies.  Believe in demons.  Pray to a goat.  So long as it doesn’t bruise me, why should I bother myself?”\r\n I chewed it over for a moment.  “There’s wisdom in that,” I said.\r\n She nodded.\r\n “But either a man helps with a baby or he does not,” I pointed out.  “There can be many opinions on a thing, but there is only one truth.”\r\n Vashet smiled lazily.  “And if the pursuit of truth was my goal, that would concern me.”  She gave a long yawn, stretching like a happy cat.  “Instead I will focus on the joy in my heart, the prosperity of the school, and understanding the Lethani.  If I have time left after that, I will put it toward worrying on the truth.”\r\n We watched the sunrise for a while longer in silence.  It occurred to me Vashet was quite a different person when she wasn’t struggling to cram the Ketan and all of Ademic into my head as quickly as possible.\r\n “That said,” Vashet added, “if you persist in clinging to your barbarian beliefs about man-mothers, you would do well to keep quiet about it.  Amusement is the best you can hope for.  Most will simply assume you an idiot for thinking such things.”\r\n I nodded.  After a long moment, I decided to finally ask the question I had been holding off for days.  “Magwyn called me Maedre.  What does it mean?”\r\n “It is your name,” she said.  “Speak of it to no one.”\r\n “It is a secret thing?”  I asked.\r\n She nodded.  “It is a thing for you and your teachers and Magwyn.  It would be dangerous to let others know what it is.”\r\n “How could it be dangerous?”\r\n Vashet looked at me as if I were daft.  “When you know a name you have power over it.  Surely you know this?”\r\n “But I know your name, and Shehyn’s and Tempi’s.  What danger is in that?”\r\n She waved a hand.  “Not those names.  Deep names.  Tempi is not the name he was given by Magwyn.  Just as Kvothe is not yours.  Deep names have meanings.”\r\n I already knew what Vashet’s name meant.  “What does Tempi mean?”\r\n “Tempi means ‘little iron.’  Tempa means iron, and it means to strike iron, and it means angry.  Shehyn gave him that name years ago.  He was a most troublesome student.”\r\n “In Aturan temper means angry.”  I pointed it out rather excitedly, amazed at the coincidence.  “And it is also something you do with iron when forging it into steel.”\r\n Vashet shrugged, unimpressed.  “That is the way of names.  Tempi is a small name, and still it holds much.  That is why you should not speak of yours, even to me.”\r\n “But I do not know your language well enough to tell what it means myself,” I protested.  “A man should know the meaning of his own name.”\r\n Vashet hesitated, then relented.  “It means flame, and thunder, and broken tree.”\r\n I thought for a while and decided I liked it.  “When Magwyn gave it to me, you seemed surprised.  Why is that?”\r\n “It is not proper for me to comment on another’s name.”  Absolute refusal.  Her gesture was so sharp it almost hurt to look at.  She came to her feet, then brushed her hands against her pants.  “Come, it is time you gave your answer to Shehyn.”\r\n\r\n Shehyn motioned for us to sit as we entered her room.  Then she took a seat herself, startling me by showing the smallest of smiles.  It was a terribly flattering gesture of familiarity.  “Have you decided?”  she asked.\r\n I nodded.  “I thank you, Shehyn, but I cannot stay.  I must return to Severen to speak with the Maer.  Tempi fulfilled his obligation when the road was made safe, but I am bound to return and explain everything that happened.”  I thought of Denna as well, but didn’t mention her.\r\n Shehyn gestured an elegant mingling of approval and regret.  “Fulfilling one’s duty is of the Lethani.”  She gave me a serious look.  “Remember, you have a sword and a name, but you must not hire yourself out as if you had taken the red.”\r\n “Vashet has explained everything to me,” I said.  Reassurance.  “I will make arrangements for my sword to be returned to Haert if I am killed.  I will not teach the Ketan or wear the red.”  Carefully attentive curiosity.  “But I am permitted to tell others I have studied fighting with you?”\r\n Reserved agreement.  “You may say you have studied with us.  But not that you are one of us.”\r\n “Of course,” I said.  “And not that I am equal to you.”\r\n Shehyn gestured content satisfaction.  Then her hands shifted and she made a small gesture of embarrassed admission.  “This is not entirely a gift,” she said.  “You will be a better fighter than many barbarians.  If you fight and win, the barbarians will think: Kvothe studied only slightly the Adem’s arts, and still he is formidable.  How much more skilled must they themselves be?”  However.  “If you fight and lose, they will think: He only learned a piece of what the Adem know.”\r\n The old woman’s eyes twinkled ever so slightly.  She gestured amusement.  “No matter what, our reputation thrives.  This serves Ademre.”\r\n I nodded.  Willing acceptance.  “It will not hurt my reputation either,” I said.  Understatement.\r\n There was a pause in the conversation, then Shehyn gestured solemn importance.  “When we spoke before, you asked me of the Rhinta.  Do you remember?”  Shehyn asked.  From the corner of my eye I saw Vashet shift uncomfortably in her seat.\r\n Suddenly excited, I nodded.\r\n “I have remembered a story of such.  Would you like to hear it?”\r\n I gestured extreme eager interest.\r\n “It is an old story, old as Ademre.  It is always told the same.  Are you ready to hear it?”  Profound formality. "

        "text":"Posted by Jake Rocheleau on Dec 28, 2010\r\n\r\n Mobile iOS devices have seen some tremendous growth over the 2010 period.  With the growing sales of iPads and the popular release of the new iPhone 4 Apple has had an amazing year.  Not only in these two markets but all iPod Touch devices are also running iOS which can access the App Store.\r\n\r\n Here we’ll be going over brief ideas of how to design icons for iOS devices.  There are many sizes and scales which require careful attention to detail and focus.  iOS designers are required to submit an icon with their app into the store during publishing.\r\n The process may be time consuming but the rewards are outstanding and provide a true sense of empowerment.\r\n\r\n iOS App Development\r\n\r\n The main process for designing an app for iOS requires two bits.  The frontend design concept requires a branding or icon design to fit in the Apple App Store.  Designers are also required to craft UI wireframe concepts for each screen of the mobile app.\r\n\r\n Developers then enter XCode and spend hours working with views and libraries to produce a fantastic final result.  Combining the graphics and programming can produce amazing applications to stand the test of time.\r\n\r\n Designers do not often consider how much work is put into development of a mobile application.  The style is different with Android-powered devices where Google hosts an open platform for any and all to build on.  The iOS App store is much more exclusive and also offers the greatest chance of reaping a small profit.\r\n\r\n Graphics Split on iPhone/iPad\r\n\r\n Each icon has a specific size which is used for a certain purpose.  The large amount of devices currently running iOS means designers must be on their toes to incorporate a keen icon set with each mobile app.\r\n\r\n iPhone/iPod Icon Sizes\r\n\r\n Application Icon – 57x57px\r\n iPhone 4 icon – 114x114px\r\n App Store Icon – 512x512px\r\n Spotlight Search – 29x29px\r\n iPhone 4 Spotlight – 58x58px\r\n The iPhone doesn’t have many icon size variations.  The official app icon which rests on one of your users’ home screens is 57 pixels length and width.  The iPhone 4 supports higher resolution settings so it’s optional to include a 114 pixel icon, though not required.\r\n\r\n The largest size necessary of an icon is 512 x 512 pixels.  This is a fairly large graphic which is displayed throughout the App Store and when browsing apps in Cover Mode.  When opening Photoshop to design a new icon it’s always recommended to start at 512 and scale your way down.\r\n\r\n Spotlight search supports slightly smaller sizes for icons.  29×29 may seem downright puny but when you’re viewing the search results screen it’s a fairly intuitive interface.  The iPhone 4 similarly supports a Spotlight Search icon refined to 58 x 58 pixels for the higher resolution screens.\r\n\r\n iPad Icon Sizes\r\n\r\n Application Icon – 72x72px\r\n App Store Icon – 512x512px\r\n Spotlight Search – 50x50px\r\n Settings Icon – 29x29px\r\n The application icon is slightly larger this time around.  The app store and cover flow sizes are still the same with an increase in our spotlight search dimensions.  The iPad boasts a fairly large tablet touchscreen so icons can fit nicely.\r\n\r\n The 29px version previous mentioned can be re-used for iPad as a settings icon.  If you create a settings page within the iOS general functionality it will display a small icon next to your tab.  This can be nice to allow users to change themes, include different accounts/usernames, and also fiddle with smaller options regarding your app.\r\n\r\n Basic Icon Rules\r\n\r\n The App Store only accepts applications which offer PNG files for icons.  For many detailed reasons PNGs are able to hold deeper colors while not requiring much hard drive space.\r\n\r\n You may also notice that icons from the app store have a gloss over their exterior.  This is an effect added at runtime and shouldn’t be added into your actual icon.  There is a Boolean switch which any app developer can use to turn the glossy icon effect on or off.  However most icons benefit from the effect when done properly, so it’s best to leave this setting alone.\r\n\r\n The iOS platform also applies rounded corners to icons in most screens.  When designing your icon set be sure to keep all corners flat at 90 degrees for a perfect square.  This is very important because Apple will add the rounded corner effects for your icons by default.  If you apply this beforehand your graphics may publish improperly.\r\n\r\n UI Tips & Design Kits\r\n\r\n Icon designers should also shy away from using transparency in designs.  This is reflected poorly when apps get published to the store since iOS has a difficult time rendering areas from an icon as transparent.  If you’d like some inspiration check out our best iPhone apps for web designers.\r\n\r\n There are also many resources available to app designers today.  Icon artists are fairly open about sharing their projects and love helping the design community with their contribution.  Browse the many UI kits for iPhone and iPad development which are free of charge and easy to download.\r\n\r\n This has been a developed overview for starting iOS icon design.  The process will require months of hard work and dedicated practice to master such an art.  However the skills and production value of iPhone apps is tremendous and surely icon design is a skill worth acquiring."

        "text":"25 Superpowers You Wish You Had.\r\n\r\n Admit it – At some point in your life, you’ve run around the house in a cape, or at least thought about doing it.  Don’t worry.  No judgment here.  There’s just something fascinating about superheroes that captures the imaginations of young and old alike.  It’s fun to envision how different life would be if we developed superpowers of our own.  Whether you’re a diehard superhero fan who attended the midnight premiere of “The Avengers” or you only know a little bit about superheroes, you’ve probably wished you had one of these 25 superpowers.\r\n\r\n 25 Power Mimicry.\r\n Is there a certain skill you wish you could be good at?  Power mimicry would allow you to copy or absorb another’s powers or skills, so you could swim as fast as Michael Phelps, direct movies as impeccably as Steven Spielberg, or write as many best-selling novels as J.K. Rowling.\r\n\r\n 24 Invisibility.\r\n Forget about Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak.  With the power of invisibility, you could vanish in the blink of an eye using your mind.  You could sneak out of the house without your parents knowing and play hilarious pranks on your friends without getting caught.\r\n\r\n 23 Superhuman Strength.\r\n With the help of superhuman strength, you’d have no problem winning the strongman game at carnivals, opening stubborn jars and bottles, lifting cars, breaking tiles, or performing other awesome acts without even trying.  Being as powerful as the Incredible Hulk has its advantages.\r\n\r\n 22 Healing.\r\n What if you had the power to heal?  You could not only get rid of minor injuries like cuts and bruises, but also help ease the pain of people suffering from serious illnesses.  Cancer, Alzheimer’s, and AIDs would all be history.\r\n\r\n 21 Superhuman Endurance.\r\n Superhuman endurance allows those who possess it to exert themselves during activities without getting tired.  With this power, you could run marathons, clean the house, and study for long periods of time with ease.\r\n\r\n 20 Water Breathing.\r\n If you had the power of water breathing, you could breathe underwater like a fish.  You’d be able to scuba dive without bringing an oxygen tank and if you ever had to jump into a lake to escape an angry swarm of bees like Yogi Bear, you’d be all set.\r\n\r\n 19 Invulnerability.\r\n Invulnerability grants heroes immunity to one or more forms of physical, mental, or spiritual damage.  If you possessed this power, you would never have to worry about getting beat up by bullies, mending a broken heart, or suffering from depression.\r\n\r\n 18 Time Travel.\r\n Did the flux capacitor in your time machine break down again?  No worries!  You wouldn’t need a time machine if you possessed the power of time travel.  It would be so cool to be a part of the crowd at Woodstock or visit your future self. \r\n\r\n 17 Night Vision.\r\n Screw the flashlight app!  With night vision, you would never stub your toe on the way to bed again because your eyes would always adjust to the dark.  You could also read in the dark, which could come in handy during late-night study sessions if your roommate is asleep.\r\n\r\n 16 Telepathy.\r\n Some friends can communicate through facial expressions, interpretive dances, or in other non-audible ways.  But wouldn’t it be easier to develop the power of telepathy and communicate by reading each other’s minds?  You could carry on secret conversations in public and no one would ever know."

Next stop after that was the slippery slope into his underworld.  Thanks, but no thanks.  Been there, Anthony.  The pay is good, but the price is too high.\r\n He said to me, “If you took this on, I’d give you two hundred up front, and a third of what you got back from the Feds.”  He added, in case I didn’t get the math, “That could be three, four, maybe five million for you.”\r\n He wasn’t actually as dim as I thought, and he also figured out that I probably needed the dough, which would make most men vulnerable to the temptations of the devil.  I replied, “Actually, it’s about zero.”\r\n “No, you at least get two hundred up front and it’s yours.”\r\n “No, it’s yours.”\r\n He seemed a little exasperated and tried a new approach.  “Hey, Counselor, I think you owe me and my family something on this.”\r\n “Anthony, I don’t owe you a thing.”  In fact, Junior, your father owes me fifty large.  I continued, “At the end, I wasn’t working for your father when he cut his own deal with the government.  The only representation he had, as far as I know, was his personal attorney, Jack Weinstein” – who was actually a mob attorney – “so you should speak to him if you haven’t already.”\r\n “Jack is retired.”\r\n “So am I.”\r\n As far as I was concerned, this meeting was over.  We’d covered the walk down memory lane, and I’d squashed the clumsy recruiting pitch, so unless Junior wanted to hear that his father had actually been a government stool pigeon, or wanted to hear about my feelings on the subject of his father pulling some strings to get my tax returns examined, or seducing my wife, then there was little else to talk about – unless he wanted to talk about the night his father was murdered.  On that subject, I reminded him, “Don’t forget what we discussed regarding my ex-wife.”\r\n He nodded, then asked me, “I mean, do you give a shit?”\r\n “My children do.”\r\n He nodded again, and said, “Don’t worry about it.”\r\n “Good.”  I was about to reannounce my early departure, but then he said, “I never understood how she got off on that.”\r\n “She had good lawyers.”\r\n “Yeah?  I guess that wasn’t you.”\r\n “Anthony, go fuck yourself.”\r\n Like his father, who rarely, if ever, heard a personal insult, he didn’t know how to react to that.  He seemed to be wavering between explosive rage or sloughing it off as a joke.  He picked the latter, and forced a laugh, saying, “You got to learn to curse in Italian.  You say, vaffanculo.  That means, like, Go fuck your ass.  In English, we say, Go fuck yourself.  Same thing.”\r\n “Interesting.  Well-”\r\n “But, I mean, do you think it’s fair that she walked on a premeditated murder?  She got a different kind of justice because of who she is.  Right?  I mean, what is this?  Open season on Italians?”\r\n “This subject is closed.  Or take it up with the Justice Department.”\r\n “Yeah, right.”\r\n “And don’t even think about what you’re thinking about.”\r\n He stared at me, but said nothing.\r\n I started to slide out of the booth, but the waitress appeared with two covered serving dishes, and the sweet but obviously inexperienced young lady asked us, “You want to share?”\r\n Anthony, whose mood had darkened somewhat, reminded her, “We got the same fucking thing.”  He looked at me and asked, “You believe this moron?” "

        "text":"But we've gone sixty feet past the last hit with the probes and haven't gotten anything.  We also got another flyover from Nellis last night.  There was nothing new from thermal imaging.  So we feel pretty comfortable at this time that we've got them all.\"\r\n \"And thank God for that.  Harvey?  What have you got for us?\"\r\n Richards cleared his throat and leaned forward so that his voice would be heard by the electronic pickups, wherever they were.\r\n \"Greta's right, we have all eight excavated so far in the morgue at Nellis.  So far the veil of secrecy is holding up.  I think people there think we're bringing in aliens off a crashed saucer in the desert.  This is how urban legends start, people.\"\r\n Only Alpert cracked a smile.  Richards continued.\r\n \"We've conducted full autopsies on four so far and initial exams of the others.  Similar to what Greta said, we're not finding a hell of a lot of difference from body to body.  This guy is a robot.  No variation on theme.  It's almost like the killings themselves are of no import.  Perhaps it is the hunt that juices this guy.  Or perhaps the killings are just part of a larger plan we don't know about yet.\"\r\n Rachel stared pointedly at Alpert.  She hated that people working so closely on the case were still working in the dark.  But she knew if she said anything she would quickly be on the outside looking in.  She didn't want that.\r\n \"You have a question, Rachel?\"\r\n He'd caught her off guard.  She hesitated.\r\n \"Why are the bodies being taken to Nellis instead of hereorL.A. ?\"  She knew the answer before asking the question but needed to say something to escape the moment.\r\n \"It's easier to keep a lid on things this way.  The military knows how to keep a secret.\"\r\n His tone suggested an unspoken final line: Do you?  He swung his view back to Richards.\r\n \"Doctor, go on.\"\r\n Rachel picked up on the subtle difference.  Alpert had called Richards Doctor, whereas he had simply addressed Greta Coxe by her first name.  It was a character trait.  Alpert either had trouble with women in positions of power and knowledge or he didn't respect the science of anthropology.  She guessed it was the former.\r\n \"Well, we're looking at suffocation as the cause on these,\" Richards said.  \"It's pretty obvious from what we've got.  There is not a lot left to work with on most of them but with what we've got we're not seeing other injuries.  The unsub overpowers in some way, tapes wrists and ankles and then puts the bag in place over the head.  The taping around the neck we think is significant.  That is indicative of a slow death.  In other words the unsub was not holding the bag in place.  He took his time, pulled it over the head, taped it and then could step back to watch.\"\r\n \"Doctor?\"  Rachel asked.  \"Was the tape applied from the front or back?\"\r\n \"The ends are at the back of the neck, indicating to me that the bag may have been pulled over from behind, possibly when the victim was in a sitting position, and then taped in place.\"\r\n \"So he-the, uh, unsub-may have been ashamed or afraid to face his victims when he did this.\"\r\n \"Quite possibly.\"\r\n \"How are we doing on identification?\"  Alpert asked.\r\n Richards looked at Sundeen and he took over.\r\n \"Still just the five that were included in the Las Vegas investigation.  We assume the sixth from their group will be one of the final two excavations.  The others we have nothing on so far.  We've got no useable prints.  We've forwarded the clothing-what's left of it-to Quantico and perhaps Brass has an update on that.  Meantime, we-\"\r\n \"No, no update,\" Doran said from the television screen.\r\n \"Okay,\" Sundeen said.  \"We have the dental data just going into the computer today.  So maybe we'll get a hit there.  Other than that we're just waiting for something to happen.\"\r\n He nodded at the completion of his report.  Alpert took back the lead.\r\n \"I want to go to Brass last, so let's hear about the soil.\"\r\n Mary Pond took it from there.\r\n \"We've sifted all of the sites and it's all come up clean except for one piece we got yesterday that is exciting.  In excavation seven we found a wad of gum in a wrapper.  Juicy Fruit, according to the wrapper.  It was between twenty-four and thirty inches down in a three-foot grave.  So we really feel it is related and could be a good break for us.\"\r\n \"Dental?\"  Alpert asked.\r\n \"Yes, we have dental.  I can't tell you what yet but it looked like three good impressions.  I boxed it and sent it to Brass.\"\r\n \"Yes, it is here,\" Doran said from the television.  \"Came in this morning.  I put it in motion but I don't have anything on it yet either.  Maybe late today.  I agree, though.  From what I saw we'll get at least three teeth out of it.  Maybe even DNA.\"\r\n \"Could be all we need,\" Alpert added excitedly.\r\n Even though she distinctly remembered that Bob Backus had a habit of chewing Juicy Fruit gum, Rachel was not excited.  The gum in the grave was too good to be true.  She thought there was no way that Backus would allow himself to leave such important evidence behind.  He was too good as both a killer and agent for that.  She could not properly express this doubt in the meeting, however, because of her agreement with Alpert not to bring up Backus in front of other agents.\r\n \"It's got to be a plant,\" she said.\r\n Alpert looked at her a moment, weighing the risk of asking her why.\r\n \"A plant.  Why do you say that, Rachel?\"\r\n \"Because I can't see why this guy who is burying a body in the middle of nowhere, probably in the middle of the night, would take the time to put his shovel down, take the gum out of his mouth, wrap it in its foil, which he had to take out of his pocket, and then drop it.  I think if he'd been chewing gum he would have just spit it out.  But I don't think he was chewing gum.  I think he picked that little wad up somewhere, brought it to the grave and dropped it in so we would spin our wheels with it when he decided to lead us to the bodies with his GPS trick.\"\r\n She glanced around the room.  She had their eyes but she could tell she was more of a curiosity to them than a respected colleague.  The silence was broken by the television.\r\n \"I think Rachel is probably right,\" Doran said.  \"We have been manipulated from day one on this.  Why not with the gum?  It does seem like an incredible mistake for such a well-planned action.\"\r\n Rachel noticed Doran wink at her.\r\n \"One piece of gum, one mistake, in eight graves?\"  said Gunning, one of the agents from Quantico.  \"I don't think that is such a long shot.  We all know nobody's ever committed the perfect crime.  Yes, people get away but they all make mistakes.\"\r\n \"Well,\" Alpert said, \"let's wait and see what we get with this before we jump to any conclusions one way or the other.  Mary, anything else?\"\r\n \"Not at this time.\"\r\n \"Then let's go to Agent Cates to see how the locals are doing with the IDs.\"\r\n Cates opened a leather-bound folder on the table in front of him.  It contained a legal pad with notes on it.  That he had such a nice and expensive holder for a basic legal pad told Rachel that he was very proud of his work and what he did.  Either that or the person who gave him the folder had those feelings.  Either way, it made Rachel like him right away.  It also made her feel like she was missing something.  She no longer carried that kind of pride in the bureau or what she did.\r\n \"Okay, we started sniffing around Vegas Metro on their missing persons case.  We're handicapped by the need for secrecy.  So we're not going in there like gang-busters.  We've just made contact and said we're interested because of the state line thing-victims from multiple states and even one other country.  That gives us an in but we don't want to show our hand by blasting in there.  So we're supposed to have a sitdown with them later today.  Once we reach the beach, so to speak, we'll start back tracing these individuals and looking for the common denominator.  Keep in mind these guys have been on this for several weeks and as far as we know don't have shit.\"\r\n \"Agent Cates,\" Alpert said.  \"The tape.\"\r\n \"Oh, excuse my language there.  They don't have anything is what I meant to say.\"\r\n \"Very good, Agent Cates.  Keep me informed.\"\r\n And only silence followed.  Alpert continued to smile warmly at Cates until the local agent got the message.\r\n \"Oh, um, you want me to leave?\"\r\n \"I want you out there working on those victims,\" Alpert said.  \"No sense wasting time in here listening to us hash things around to no end.\"\r\n \"Okay, then.\"\r\n Cates got up.  If he had been a white man the embarrassment would have been more recognizable on his face.\r\n \"Thank you, Agent Cates,\" Alpert said to his back as he went through the door.\r\n Alpert then turned his attention back to the table.\r\n \"I think Mary, Greta, Harvey and Doug can all be excused as well.  We need you guys back in the trenches, I'm afraid.  No pun intended.\"\r\n There was that administrative smile again.\r\n \"Actually,\" Mary Pond said, \"I'd like to stay and hear what Brass has to say.  It might help me in the field.\"\r\n Alpert lost his smile at the challenge.\r\n \"No,\" he said firmly, \"that won't be necessary.\"\r\n An uneasy silence engulfed the room until it was finally punctuated by the sounds of the science team's chairs being pushed back from their tables.  The four of them got up and left the room without speaking.  It was painful for Rachel to watch.  The unchecked arrogance of command staff was endemic in the bureau.  It was never going to change.\r\n \"Now, where were we?\"  Alpert said, easily morphing past what he had just done to five good people.  \"Brass, your turn now.  I have you down here for the boat, the tape and bags, the clothes, the GPS device, and now you have the gum, which we all know will lead nowhere, thank you very much, Agent Walling.\"\r\n He said the.word agent like it was synonymous with idiot.  Rachel raised her hands in surrender.\r\n \"Sorry, I didn't know half the field team is in the dark on the suspect.  Funny, but when I was in Behavioral we never did it that way.  We pooled information and knowledge.  We didn't hide it from one another.\"\r\n \"You mean when you were working for the man we are looking for right now?\"\r\n \"Look, Agent Alpert, if you are trying to taint me with that brush, then you-\"\r\n \"This is a classified case, Agent Walling.  That is all I am trying to get across to you.  As I told you before, it is 'need to know.'\"\r\n \"Obviously.\"\r\n Alpert turned away from her as if dismissing her from memory and looked at the television screen.\r\n \"Brass, can you begin please?\"\r\n Alpert made sure he stood between Rachel and the screen, to further underline her position as outsider on the case.\r\n \"Okay,\" Doran said, \"I have something significant and… well, strange, to begin with.  I told you about the boat yesterday.  The initial fingerprint analysis of manageable surfaces came back negative.  It had been out there in the elements for who knows how long.  So we took it another step.  Agent Alpert approved disassembly of the evidence and that was done in the hangar at Nellis last night.  On the boat there are grip locations-handholds for moving the boat.  This at one time was a navy lifeboat, built in the late thirties and probably sold off as military surplus after World War Two.\"\r\n As Doran continued Dei opened a file and pulled out a photo of the boat.  She held it for Rachel to see, since Rachel had never actually seen the boat.  It was already at Nellis by the time she had gotten to the excavation site.  She thought it was amazing and typical that the bureau could amass so much information about a boat set adrift in the desert but so little about the crime it was attached to.\r\n \"We could not get into the interior of the grip holes with our first analysis.  When we disassembled the piece we were able to get in there.  This is where we got lucky because this little hollow was protected from the elements for the most part.\"\r\n \"And?\"  Alpert asked impatiently.  He obviously wasn't interested in the journey.  He just wanted the destination.\r\n \"And we got two prints out of the port side grip on the bow.  This morning we ran them through the data banks and got a hit almost right away.  This is going to sound strange but the prints came from Terry McCaleb.\"\r\n \"How can that be?\"  asked Dei.\r\n Alpert didn't say anything.  His eyes stared down at the table in front of him.  Rachel sat quiet as well, her mind racing to catch up with and understand this latest piece of information.  \"At some point he put his hand into the grip hole on the boat, that's the only way it can be,\" Doran said.\r\n \"But he's dead,\" Alpert said.\r\n \"What?\"  Rachel exclaimed.\r\n Everyone in the room turned and looked at her.  Dei slowry nodded.\r\n \"He died about a month ago.  Heart attack.  I guess the news didn't get to South Dakota.\"\r\n Doran's voice came from the speaker.\r\n \"Rachel, I am so sorry.  I should have gotten word to you.  But I was too upset about it and went out to California right away.  I'm sorry.  I should have told you.\"\r\n Rachel looked down at her hands.  Terry McCaleb had been her friend and colleague.  He was one of the em-paths.  She felt a sudden and deep sense of loss, despite the fact that she had not spoken to him in years.  Their shared experiences had left them bonded for life and now that life, for him, was gone.\r\n \"Okay, people, let's take a break here,\" Alpert said.  \"Fifteen minutes and then back in here.  Brass, can you callback?\"\r\n \"I will.  I've got more to report.\"\r\n \"Talk to you then.\"\r\n They all filed out to get coffee or use the restrooms.  To leave Rachel alone.\r\n \"Are you all right, Agent Walling?\"  Alpert asked.\r\n She looked up at him.  The last thing she would take would be comfort from him.\r\n \"I'm fine,\" she said, moving her eyes back to the blank TV screen.  Rachel remained in the conference room by herself.  Her initial shock gave way to a wave of guilt coming up behind her like a following sea.  Terry McCaleb had attempted to contact her over the years.  She had gotten the messages but had never responded.  She had sent him a card and a note when he was in the hospital recovering from the transplant.  That had been five or six years ago.  She couldn't remember. "

        "text":"A number of travel traditions have been forgotten or discarded over the years, and while we won’t be wishing for a return to the days of covered wagons or smoking sections on airplanes, there are a handful of lost travel traditions I’d love to see rescued from obscurity.\r\n\r\n Read on for the 14 lost travel traditions that I’d love to make a comeback:\r\n1) The Handwritten Letter\r\n Handwritten letters are thoughtful and sentimental and make nostalgic scrapbook keepsakes.  A collection of lovingly written letters is also a heck of a lot more romantic than a stack of printed emails or a memory chip of text messages.\r\n 2) The Postcard\r\n\r\n The “Wish You Were Here!”  postcard used to be the only method we had of announcing to friends and colleagues that we were on vacation while simultaneously rubbing it in that they weren’t.\r\n\r\n Though we now have Facebook status updates to do that, it’s not the same.  Postcards made it more personal.  They also made for pretty travel keepsakes. \r\n 3) Cross-Atlantic Voyages\r\n\r\n Today, a successful cross-Atlantic voyage is one where your flight isn’t delayed and your seatmate doesn’t hog the armrests.\r\n\r\n Before air travel, however, a successful cross-Atlantic voyage was one where you didn’t get scurvy and arrived with the same number of family members with which you departed.\r\n\r\n Though ship travel was certainly dangerous, it was exciting and daring in a way that air travel — with its cranky crew and cockamamie travel restrictions — can’t begin to compare.\r\n 4) Dining Cars on Trains\r\n\r\n There’s something tantalizing and almost illicit about eating dinner while the world zooms by outside, like running with scissors or having ice cream for breakfast.\r\n\r\n Though dining cars are still in existence today, they’re uncommon and mostly limited to tourist trains.\r\n 5) Film Cameras\r\n\r\n Thanks to the digital camera, we now have the ability to take a near limitless amount of photos and then instantly post them on the Internet for all to see.  And while this has been convenient, it’s also turned us all into snap-happy hussies.\r\n\r\n This wasn’t the case 15 years ago, when we couldn’t afford to waste precious film on 23 near-identical photos of our cat, Tootles.  When we were limited to just a single roll of a film, we had to be selective, to be picky and to ask ourselves: How many pictures of the Eiffel tower do I really need?\r\n 6) Hitch-hiking\r\n\r\n From the 1930s through the 1970s, hopping into the back of a stranger’s pick-up truck or squeezing into the bench seat of a family’s station wagon (Oooh, remember bench seats?)  was a common way to travel on the cheap.\r\n\r\n Hitch-hiking became a popular means of travel in the United States during the Great Depression, when few were wealthy enough to afford a car or public transportation.\r\n\r\n Though it’s declined since then, we like the community trust and social interaction fostered by hitchhiking.  Thus, we give it a big thumbs up.\r\n 7) Road Trips\r\n\r\n Books-on-tape, wrinkled maps, cups of over-sweetened coffee at early morning pit stops and watching the towns and billboards slide by to the thumping soundtrack of your road-trip mix tape …what’s not to love?\r\n\r\n Unfortunately, due to the high price of gas and the prevalence of budget airlines, the long-haul road trip has come to a dead end of sorts.\r\n 8) Getting Dressed Up for Flights\r\n\r\n Once upon a time, when flying was rare enough to still be considered a special occasion, people dressed up for flights.  Today, by contrast, people barely get dressed at all;  preferring a track suit over a business suit and pajama bottoms over a pencil skirt.\r\n\r\n While enforcing a mandatory airline dress code would never, well, fly with today’s comfort-seeking airline passengers, would it be too much to ask people to refrain from wandering the cabin barefoot?\r\n 9) Pen-Pals\r\n\r\n While having a pen pal is not completely dead (it’s still a common practice among prison inmates), the novelty of it certainly is.\r\n\r\n At one time, communicating with a stranger on the other side of the globe was considered exhilarating, now it’s just considered Twitter.\r\n 10) Suitcase Trunks\r\n\r\n Durable, long lasting and able to withstand even the most careless of airline baggage handlers, suitcase trunks are the Incredible Hulks of the luggage world.\r\n\r\n While they once enjoyed rides aboard sea-soaked cargo ships and rooftop Jeep luggage racks, they now mostly sit unsold in antique stores.\r\n 11) Used Bookstores\r\n\r\n When bookstores eventually go extinct in favor of digital downloads, the satisfaction of rifling through a hostel’s collection of Lonely Planets, Paulo Coelho novels and 12 battered copies of The Beach until you find that perfect hammock-worthy book, will be lost.\r\n\r\n Books bring strangers together, they facilitate “Hey, whatcha reading?”  conversations and as any bookworm will tell you, there’s something intoxicating about the musty smell of ink and paper.\r\n 12) Easy Going Airport Check-ins\r\n\r\n Remember when you used to be able to arrive at the airport 10 minutes before your plane was due to depart and still make it on board in time.\r\n\r\n Catching a flight used to be like catching a bus.  Park, run to the gate, hand someone your ticket and you were off.  They barely asked for ID.\r\n 13) True Travel Breaks\r\n\r\n Prior to the invention of email, social media and international cell phones, kissing loved ones goodbye at the departure gate (how nostalgic?)  often meant that you didn’t see or even speak to them until you returned home.\r\n\r\n While this made leaving for an extended trip abroad hard, it provided a true break from the routine and a chance to really immerse yourself into a foreign culture.\r\n 14) Slow Travel\r\n\r\n It was hard to be in a rush to get somewhere when your only means of transportation was a horse and buggy.  Early travelers recognized the importance of appreciating the journey as well as the destination.\r\n\r\n Let’s reintroduce the concept of slow travel and living in the moment.\r\n Which lost travel traditions would you like to see make a comeback?  Let me know in the comments below."

        "text":"Grow It Yourself: Onions Are Nothing to Cry About\r\n\r\n This is the VOA Special English Agriculture Report, \r\nOnions come in different sizes, shapes, colors and flavors, from mild and sweet to hot and strong.  A full-grown onion plant has roots, bulbs and leaves.  The leaves are long, thin and hollow.  They stand straight up and thicken at the bottom to form a bulb.  Onions are biennials;  their life cycle is two years long.  But they are usually picked during their first year after flowers form and the bulbs stop growing. \r\n Onions grow best in loose, fertile soil.  They can grow in many different climates.  In cooler climates, onions may need fourteen to fifteen hours of daylight to start forming bulbs.  In warmer climates, onions can begin developing bulbs with fewer hours of daily sun.  Organic material like compost or leaf mulch can help onions grow in heavy soil.  Barbara Fick is an extension agent at Oregon State University in the northwestern United States.  She says a faster way to grow onions is to plant small bulbs known as sets instead of seeds.  Onions can be harvested once their tops have dried and fallen over.  You can store onions for months.  But Barbara Fick says stored onions need to be cured first.  \"Curing is a way of making sure those leaves on the outside are nice and dry.\"  Here are some directions from editors at the National Gardening Association.  First, dry the onions in the sun for a day or so.  Then bring them out of direct sun for two to three weeks.  Spread them out in any warm, airy place that is covered.  Or cover the onions with a light cotton sheet held in place with stones along the edge.  The sheet will keep the sun from burning the bulbs.  Don't worry about rain.  And do not use a plastic or canvas sheet.  Heavy coverings will trap moisture and keep the onions from drying fully.  Turn the bulbs a couple of times to help them dry evenly.  After curing the onions, you can hang them indoors in mesh bags to dry even more.  There should be no wet spots on the onions when they are put in storage.  Editors at the National Gardening Association say the longer onions are cured, the better they will keep.  Some people cut off the top leaves before curing onions.  If you do that, do not cut the leaves any closer than two and a half centimeters from the bulb. \r\n For VOA Special English, I'm Alex Villarreal.

        "text":" I noticed, too, that Mr. Nasim hadn’t invested in air-conditioning, and a floor fan moved the warm, humid air around the big library.\r\n On the table was a silver tray piled high with sticky-looking pastry.  My host said to me, “I enjoy the English tea, but I prefer Persian sweets to cucumber sandwiches.”\r\n I noted his use of the word “Persian” as opposed to “Iranian,” which had some negative connotations since the Islamic Revolution, the ’79 hostage crisis, and subsequent misunderstandings between our countries.\r\n Mr. Nasim whipped out his cell phone, speed-dialed, said a few words in Farsi, then hung up and said to me with a smile, “The high-tech version of the servant call button.”  He informed me, “Tea will arrive shortly,” just in case I thought he’d called the Revolutionary Guards to take me hostage.\r\n He sat back in his satin chair and asked me, “To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr. Sutter?”\r\n I replied, without apologizing for my unannounced house call, “First, I wanted to let you know – personally and officially – that I’m staying in the gatehouse.”\r\n “Thank you.”  He added politely, “Perhaps I should have called on you.”\r\n My limited experience with Arabs, Pakistanis, and Iranians in London was that they fell into two categories: those who tried to emulate the British, and those who went out of their way not to.  Mr. Nasim, so far, seemed to fall into the former category of, “See how Western I am?  Am I getting it right?”\r\n I informed him, “It is I who am living on your property, so I should call on you.  Which brings me to the other point of my visit.  I saw Mrs. Allard a few days ago in the hospice house, and I believe she doesn’t have much time left.”\r\n He seemed genuinely surprised and replied, “Yes?  I didn’t know that.  I thought… well, I am sorry to hear that news.”\r\n “When she dies, as you know, her life tenancy expires with her.”\r\n “Yes, I know that.”\r\n He didn’t seem outwardly thrilled to learn that he was about to get his property back, but he knew, of course, this day would come, and he’d already made plans for it, and I’m sure those plans didn’t include me.  Nevertheless, I said, “Therefore, I’d like to ask you if I could rent – or buy – the gatehouse.”\r\n “Yes?  You want to live there?”\r\n “It’s an option.”\r\n He nodded, thought a moment, then said, “I see…”\r\n “If I rented, it would be only for a month or two.”\r\n “I see.  So you need a place to stay while you are not in London.”\r\n “How did you know I lived in London?”\r\n “I was told by Mrs. Sutter.”\r\n “I assume you mean my ex-wife.”\r\n “That is correct.”\r\n “And what else did she tell you?  So I don’t take your time by repeating what you already know.”\r\n He shrugged and replied, “When she purchased the house – the former guest cottage – she paid a courtesy call.  It was a Sunday, and I was here with my wife, and we had tea and she spoke generally of her situation.”\r\n “I see.  And since then, she’s informed you that her ex-husband has returned from London.”\r\n “Correct.”  He added, “Not me, actually.  Soheila.  My wife.  They speak.”\r\n I wanted to warn him that Mrs. Sutter was an adulteress and not good company for Soheila.  But why cause trouble?  I returned to my subject and said, “So, if you have no objection, I’d like to rent the gatehouse for a month or two – with an option to buy.”\r\n “It is not for sale, but-”\r\n"

At the time she told herself it was because she wasn't going to be stuck in Minot for very long.  But she knew then as she knew now that the real reason was she didn't want the connection.  She didn't want the questions about the choices she had made.  She didn't want that link to the past.\r\n Now she didn't have to worry, the link was forever gone.\r\n The door opened and Cherie Dei looked in.\r\n \"Rachel, do you want a bottle of water?\"\r\n \"Sure, that would be nice.  Thank you.\"\r\n \"Tissues?\"\r\n \"No, that's all right, I'm not crying.\"\r\n \"Be right back.\"\r\n Dei closed the door.\r\n \"I don't cry,\" Rachel said to no one.\r\n She put her elbows on the table and held her hands over her face.  In the darkness she saw a memory.  She and Terry on a case.  They weren't partners but Backus had put them together on this one.  It was a crime scene analysis.  A bad one.  A mother and daughter tied up and thrown into the water, the girl squeezing so hard on a crucifix it left its full impression on her hand.  The mark was still there when the bodies were found.  Terry was working with the photos and Rachel went to the cafeteria to get coffee.  When she came back she could tell he had been crying.  That was when she knew he was an empath, that he was her kind.\r\n Dei came back into the room and put a bottle of spring water and a plastic cup down in front her.\r\n \"You okay?\"\r\n \"Yes, fine.  Thanks for the water.\"\r\n \"It was quite a shock.  I didn't really know him and it bowled me over when the word spread.\"\r\n Rachel just nodded.  She didn't want to talk about it.  The speakerphone rang and Rachel reached for it ahead of Dei.  She picked up the handset rather than push the teleconference button.  This way she could speak privately at first to Doran-at least, Doran's side of it would not be overheard.\r\n \"Brass?\"\r\n \"Rachel, hi, I am so sorry I didn't-\" \"It's all right.  It isn't your job to keep me informed of everything.\"\r\n \"I know but this I should have told you about.\"\r\n \"It was probably in one of the bulletins and I just missed it.  It's just strange finding out about it this way.\"\r\n \"I know.  I'm sorry.\"\r\n \"So you went to the funeral?\"\r\n \"The service, yes.  It was out on the island where he lived.  Catalina.  It was really beautiful there and really sad.\"\r\n \"Were there many agents?\"\r\n \"No, not too many.  It was kind of hard to get to.  You have to take a ferry.  But there were a few and there were some cops and family and friends.  Clint Eastwood was there.  I think he took his own helicopter out.\"\r\n The door opened and Alpert came in.  He seemed renewed, as if he had been sucking on pure oxygen during the break.  The other two agents, Zigo and Gunning, followed him in and sat down.\r\n \"We're ready to start,\" Rachel said to Doran.  \"I've got to put you on the screen now.\"\r\n \"Okay, Rachel.  We'll talk later.\"\r\n Rachel handed the phone to Alpert, who set up the teleconference.  Doran appeared on the screen, looking more tired than before.\r\n \"Okay,\" Alpert said.  \"We ready to continue?\"\r\n After no one said a word he continued.\r\n \"All right then, what do these prints on the boat mean?\"\r\n \"It means we've got to find out when and why McCaleb was out in the desert before he died,\" Dei said.\r\n \"And it means we've got to go over to L.A. and take a look at his death,\" Gunning said.  \"Just to be sure a heart attack was a heart attack.\"\r\n \"I agree with that but there is a problem,\" Doran said.  \"He was cremated.\"\r\n \"That sucks,\" said Gunning.\r\n \"Was there an autopsy?\"  Alpert asked.  \"Blood and tissue taken?\"\r\n \"I don't know about that,\" Doran said.  \"All I know is that he was cremated.  I flew out for the service.  The family let his ashes go over the side of his boat.\"\r\n Alpert looked at the faces around the room and stopped at Gunning's.\r\n \"Ed, you're on it.  Go over there and see what you can come up with.  Do it quick.  I'll call the FO over there and tell them to give you the people you need.  And for God's sake keep it out of the press.  McCaleb was a minor celebrity because of the movie thing.  If the press gets a whiff of this they'll be on us like the jacket on a book.\"\r\n \"Got it.\"\r\n \"Other ideas?  Suggestions?\"\r\n Nobody said anything at first.  Then Rachel cleared her throat and spoke quietly.\r\n \"You know, Backus was Terry's mentor, too.\"\r\n There was a pause of silence and then Doran said, \"That's right.\"\r\n \"When they started the mentoring program Terry was the first one Backus picked.  I was next after that.\"\r\n \"And what is the significance of that to us now?\"  Alpert asked.\r\n Rachel shrugged.  \"Who knows?  But Backus called me out with the GPS.  Maybe he called Terry out before me.\"\r\n Everybody paused for a moment to think about that.\r\n \"I mean, why am I here?  Why did he send the package to me when he knows I'm not in Behavioral anymore?  There's a reason.  Backus has some kind of plan.  Maybe Terry was the first part of it.\"\r\n Alpert slowly nodded his head.\r\n \"I think it is an angle we need to be aware of.\"\r\n \"He could be watching Rachel,\" Doran said.\r\n \"Well, let's not jump ahead of ourselves here,\" Alpert said.  \"Let's stay with the facts.  Agent Walling, I want you to exercise all caution of course.  But let's check out the McCaleb situation and see what we've got before we start jumping.  Meantime, Brass, what else have you got?\"\r\n They waited as Doran looked down and off camera at some paperwork and apparently shifted gears from McCaleb back to the rest of the evidence.\r\n \"We've got something that might tie in with McCaleb.  But let me go down my list and get this other stuff out of the way first.  Uh, first, we're just starting now with the tape and the bags recovered with the bodies.  Give us another day on that and I'll have a report.  Let's see, on the clothes, they're probably going to be in the drying room another week before they're ready for analysis.  So nothing there.  The gum we already talked about.  We'll put the dental profile into the bite mark database by the end of the day.  Which leaves the GPS.\"\r\n Rachel noticed that everyone in the room was staring intently at the television screen.  It was as if Doran was in the room with them.\r\n \"We're making some good progress here.  We traced the serial number to a Big Five Sporting Goods store in Long Beach, California.  Agents from the Los Angeles FO went to the store yesterday and obtained a store sales record showing the purchase of this Gulliver one hundred model by a man named Aubrey Snow.  Turns out Mr. Snow is a fishing guide and was out on the water yesterday.  Last night, when he finally returned to dock he was questioned at length about his Gulliver.  He told us that he lost the device about eleven months ago in a poker game with several other guides.  It was valuable because at the time it had several waypoints corresponding to his favorite or most productive fishing spots along the coast of Southern California and Mexico.\"\r\n \"Did he give us the guy who won it?\"  Alpert asked quickly.\r\n \"Unfortunately, no.  It was an impromptu game.  There was bad weather at the time and business was slow. "

        "text":"• Study estimates staggering size of offshore economy\r\n • Private banks help wealthiest to move cash into havens\r\n\r\n Heather Stewart, business editor \r\n guardian.co.uk,  Saturday 21 July 2012 21.00 BST\r\n\r\n A global super-rich elite has exploited gaps in cross-border tax rules to hide an extraordinary £13 trillion ($21tn) of wealth offshore – as much as the American and Japanese GDPs put together – according to research commissioned by the campaign group Tax Justice Network.\r\n\r\n James Henry, former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey and an expert on tax havens, has compiled the most detailed estimates yet of the size of the offshore economy in a new report, The Price of Offshore Revisited, released exclusively to the Observer.\r\n\r\n He shows that at least £13tn – perhaps up to £20tn – has leaked out of scores of countries into secretive jurisdictions such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands with the help of private banks, which vie to attract the assets of so-called high net-worth individuals.  Their wealth is, as Henry puts it, \"protected by a highly paid, industrious bevy of professional enablers in the private banking, legal, accounting and investment industries taking advantage of the increasingly borderless, frictionless global economy\".  According to Henry's research, the top 10 private banks, which include UBS and Credit Suisse in Switzerland, as well as the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, managed more than £4tn in 2010, a sharp rise from £1.5tn five years earlier.\r\n\r\n The detailed analysis in the report, compiled using data from a range of sources, including the Bank of International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund, suggests that for many developing countries the cumulative value of the capital that has flowed out of their economies since the 1970s would be more than enough to pay off their debts to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n Oil-rich states with an internationally mobile elite have been especially prone to watching their wealth disappear into offshore bank accounts instead of being invested at home, the research suggests.  Once the returns on investing the hidden assets is included, almost £500bn has left Russia since the early 1990s when its economy was opened up.  Saudi Arabia has seen £197bn flood out since the mid-1970s, and Nigeria £196bn.\r\n\r\n \"The problem here is that the assets of these countries are held by a small number of wealthy individuals while the debts are shouldered by the ordinary people of these countries through their governments,\" the report says.\r\n\r\n The sheer size of the cash pile sitting out of reach of tax authorities is so great that it suggests standard measures of inequality radically underestimate the true gap between rich and poor.  According to Henry's calculations, £6.3tn of assets is owned by only 92,000 people, or 0.001% of the world's population – a tiny class of the mega-rich who have more in common with each other than those at the bottom of the income scale in their own societies.\r\n\r\n \"These estimates reveal a staggering failure: inequality is much, much worse than official statistics show, but politicians are still relying on trickle-down to transfer wealth to poorer people,\" said John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network.  \"People on the street have no illusions about how unfair the situation has become.\"\r\n\r\n TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: \"Countries around the world are under intense pressure to reduce their deficits and governments cannot afford to let so much wealth slip past into tax havens.\r\n\r\n \"Closing down the tax loopholes exploited by multinationals and the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share will reduce the deficit.  This way the government can focus on stimulating the economy, rather than squeezing the life out of it with cuts and tax rises for the 99% of people who aren't rich enough to avoid paying their taxes.\"\r\n\r\n Assuming the £13tn mountain of assets earned an average 3% a year for its owners, and governments were able to tax that income at 30%, it would generate a bumper £121bn in revenues – more than rich countries spend on aid to the developing world each year.\r\n\r\n Groups such as UK Uncut have focused attention on the paltry tax bills of some highly wealthy individuals, such as Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, with campaigners at one recent protest shouting: \"Where did all the money go?  He took it off to Monaco!\"  Much of Green's retail empire is owned by his wife, Tina, who lives in the low-tax principality.\r\n\r\n A spokeswoman for UK Uncut said: \"People like Philip Green use public services – they need the streets to be cleaned, people need public transport to get to their shops – but they don't want to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n Leaders of G20 countries have repeatedly pledged to close down tax havens since the financial crisis of 2008, when the secrecy shrouding parts of the banking system was widely seen as exacerbating instability.  But many countries still refuse to make details of individuals' financial worth available to the tax authorities in their home countries as a matter of course.  Tax Justice Network would like to see this kind of exchange of information become standard practice, to prevent rich individuals playing off one jurisdiction against another.\r\n\r\n \"The very existence of the global offshore industry, and the tax-free status of the enormous sums invested by their wealthy clients, is predicated on secrecy,\" said Henry."

        "text":"Carriers in Criminal Psychology.\r\n\r\n Since the field of psychology is so diverse, psychologists work in wide range of special areas.  A person who plans a career in any field of psychology must first obtain a bachelor’s degree.  But career opportunities are greatest for those with a doctoral degree.  According to the U.S. Department of Education, psychology is the second most popular college major study behind business and law.  And there is a strong tendency in the increase of carriers in psychology.\r\n\r\n The chief professional association for psychologists in the United States is the American Psychological Association which was founded in 1892.  The APA now consists of approximately 50 special divisions including that of criminal psychology.\r\n\r\n For many years psychologists sought to answer a wide range of important questions about human nature: what motivates us to do crimes?  Why do so many people become depressed and behave in ways that seem self-destructive?  What causes homicide, and why is it so widespread?\r\n\r\n The role of the forensic psychologist will to a varying degree involve the provision of psychological information for the purpose of facilitating a legal decision.  That’s why many of them work in the legal system as psychological experts or forensic psychologists, trying to answer such questions.\r\n\r\n It is very difficult to answer the question what does a forensic psychologist actually do;  as this will depend on the individual forensic psychologist’s experience, background, working environment, psychological/forensic expertise.\r\n\r\n A criminal psychologist may be involved in assessment of offenders or intervention to prevent offending behavior, usually with people who have already come in contact with the legal or penal system.  Often this involves working with offenders with mental health problems, or with people who act dangerously or in an antisocial manner (for example, psychopaths).  Criminal profiling is another important role fulfilled by forensic psychologists and typically involves building psychological profiles of unknown or at-large offenders from the known evidence.\r\n\r\n They also consult with attorneys, testify in court as expert witnesses, counsel prisoners, teach in law schools, and research various justice-related issues.  Sometimes referred to as forensic psychologists, those who apply psychology to the law study a range of issues, including jury selection, eyewitness testimony, confessions to the police, lie-detecor tests, the death penalty, criminal profiling, and the insanity defense."

Oh, but these have the characteristics of someone who has...\r\n\r\n (He motions for her to wait a second and flips back a page in his notebook.)\r\n\r\n Uh, do you prefer the term \"abductee\" or \"experiencer?\"\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Actually, I prefer neither, but my partner uses \"abductee.\"\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: My preference is for the other.\r\n\r\n (He leans in and whispers.)\r\n\r\n \"I've just had a, uh... little alien experience.\"  As opposed to, \"I've just been abducted!\"\r\n\r\n (He points at her with his pen and starts to write down things.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, regardless, the girl was considered neither at the time.  She appeared more to be the victim of date rape than anything else.\r\n\r\n (He shrugs a little and writes it down.  Cut to Chrissy's bedroom, where she is sleeping.  Scully talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n She was given a physical exam and her statement was taken.  Later that night, she received her... visitation.\r\n\r\n (Chrissy, with a visible scar on her cheek, wakes up and wipes some blood off her nose.  The nosebleed has dripped down onto the pillow.  She looks at the foot of her bed and sees an alien reaching out to grab her.  She screams and turns on the light to reveal her stuffed cat.  The cat is then punted across the room.  A rattling is head from the other side of the room and she turns off the lights, scared.  Looking out at the window, she sees a giant shadow stretching across the lawn.  She gasps, then looks again to see Harold walking away.  She opens the window.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Oh, Chrissy, thank God you're all right.\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: How dare you come here.\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy, I did everything I could.\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: Don't I know it, you bastard.\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy!  Don't you remember?\r\n\r\n FATHER: What the hell is going on up there?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy!  I love you!\r\n\r\n (He runs away.  Scully starts her voice-over again.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: The father informed the police, who apprehended the boy back at his own home.\r\n\r\n (Harold sits in a chair in an interrogation room.  Detective Manners paces in the back, another man sitting across from Harold.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: We... we were abducted by aliens.\r\n\r\n MANNERS: You don't sound so sure of it.\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy doesn't remember it.\r\n\r\n MANNERS: You're willing to take a lie detector test to prove you were abducted by creatures from outer space?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Yes, I am.\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Well, too bad!  'Cause I don't need no lie detector to tell me the only thing you were abducted by were your rampaging hormones, you punk!\r\n\r\n (Harold looks away in sorrow.  Jose and Scully talk over.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: But he did take a test and passed it?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: And he stuck to his story... until we got there.\r\n\r\n (Seemingly no time has passed, but Scully is now sitting where the other man was and Mulder is walking across the room.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: If she says I raped her, then...  I guess I raped her.\r\n\r\n MULDER: You don't sound so sure of that.\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy remembers it that way.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that you raped her?\r\n\r\n (Harold will not look up at the agents.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: No, I'm not.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Well, that's too bad.  Because the next rape you experience will probably be your own... in prison.\r\n\r\n (Harold looks back down at the desk.  Scully talks over.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: That should have ended our investigation, but Mulder brought the girl in for questioning.\r\n\r\n (Chrissy sits across from Mulder.  Scully is leaning against the door at the back wall.  Chrissy's parents sit in the back.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Are you having trouble sleeping?  Are you experiencing muscle pains?  Vision problems?  Nose bleeds?  When you look at a particular object, do you receive the sudden flash that you're actually looking at something else?  An alien's face?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: Yes!\r\n\r\n (Mulder turns and talks to her parents.  Scully rolls her eyes.  Scully talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: So, my partner became convinced that she was suffering from what he calls \"post-abduction syndrome.\"\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: You don't believe in the disorder?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, I think that stress of any kind can cause all of those physical ailments.  In any case, Mulder convinced the girl and her parents to let her be hypnotized.\r\n\r\n (Mulder turns back to Chrissy.  Cut to the X-Files office.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: What is your opinion of hypnosis?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: I know that it has its therapeutic value, but it has never been proven to enhance memory.  In fact, it actually worsens it since, since, since people in that state or prone to confabulation.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: When I was doing research for my book \"The Caligarian Candidate...\"\r\n\r\n SCULLY: One of the greatest thrillers ever written.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Oh...\r\n\r\n (He chuckles.)\r\n\r\n Thank you.  I was, uh... interested in how the C.I.A., when conducting their MK-Ultra mind control experiments back in the '50s, had no idea how hypnosis went.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Hmm.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Or what it was.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: No one still knows.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Still, as a storyteller, I'm fascinated how a person's sense of consciousness can be... so transformed by nothing more magical than listening to words.  Mere words.\r\n\r\n (Cut to the interrogation room.  Doctor Fingers sits across from Chrissy very closely.  In the background, Chrissy's parents are sitting down in the back like before.  Manners is standing, then Mulder is more to the front.  Scully is still leaning on the door in the back.  His voice is very soothing and slow.  She is sitting in a recliner, eyes closed.)\r\n\r\n FINGERS: You are feeling very sleepy, very relaxed.  As your body calmly drifts deeper and deeper into a state of peaceful relaxation, you will respond only to the sound of my voice.\r\n\r\n (She opens her eyes as the room starts to become shaky in her vision.  She gasps as everyone is replaced by aliens, down to one still holding Manners' cup of coffee.  As the \"Fingers\" alien talks, the mouth does not move.)\r\n\r\n Chrissy?  Can you recall where you are?\r\n\r\n (Chrissy is hooked onto a glass table with white lines all over it up against the wall.  She and Fingers talk over the scene.)\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: I'm in a room... on a spaceship... surrounded by aliens.\r\n\r\n FINGERS: What do the aliens look like?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: They're small... but their heads and their eyes are big.  They're gray.\r\n\r\n FINGERS: Are you alone?\r\n\r\n (She looks to her left and sees Harold on a similar table, one hooked to the floor.)\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: No, Harold's on another table... but he seems really out of it... like he's not really there.\r\n\r\n (In reality, the table has donuts and coffee on it.)\r\n\r\n FINGERS: What are the aliens doing now?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: They're sort of arguing.  I sort of hear them but I can't understand what they're saying.\r\n\r\n (The aliens bicker illegibly.  The \"Scully\" alien walks over to the \"Mulder\" alien.  She and Fingers still talk over the scene.)\r\n\r\n Except the leader.  I can understand him.\r\n\r\n FINGERS: When the leader speaks to you, does his mouth move?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: No.\r\n\r\n (She starts to cry.)\r\n\r\n But I hear him in my head.\r\n\r\n FINGERS: What is he saying?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: He's telling me this is for the good of my planet, but...\r\n\r\n FINGERS: But what?\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: I don't like what he's doing.  It's like he's inside my mind, like... like he's stealing my memories.\r\n\r\n (Mulder looks at Scully.  Later, Chrissy is being led out of the room.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: The description of the aliens, the physical exam, the mindscan, the presence of another human being that appears switched off, it's all characteristic of a typical abduction.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: That's my problem with it, Mulder.  It's all a little too typical.  Abduction lore has become so prevalent in our society that you can ask someone to imagine what it would be like to be abducted and they'd concoct an identical scenario.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Yeah, if it were only one person, Scully, but we have two individuals here, each verifying the other's story.\r\n\r\n (Manners walks over to them.)\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Well, thanks a lot!  You really bleeped up this case.\r\n\r\n (Cut to present day.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, of course, he didn't actually say \"bleeped.\"  He said...\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: I'm, uh, familiar with, uh, Detective Manners' colorful phraseology.\r\n\r\n (Cut back to the interrogation room.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: You still going to hold the boy?\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Oh, you bet your blankety-blank bleep I am.\r\n\r\n MULDER: But the victim seems to confirm his alibi.\r\n\r\n MANNERS: The hell she did!  Those kids' stories couldn't be more bleeping different.\r\n\r\n (He walks away.  Scully rubs her forehead.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 4 \r\n UNKNOWN LOCATION\r\n (Harold sits in a small cell.  Screams echo throughout the room, which is so long it seems to have no end, covered with small jail cells.  He grabs the bars and pulls away in pain, gasping.  Over the room, other bars spark.  He looks down at Chrissy, who is sleeping in the cell with him.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD: Chrissy!  Chrissy!\r\n\r\n (He looks over at another gray alien in the next cell.)\r\n\r\n What do you want with us?\r\n\r\n (The alien looks at him.)\r\n\r\n What do you want with us?!\r\n\r\n (Cut to the interrogation room.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: How did the alien respond?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Well... all he did was...\r\n\r\n (Cut back to the alien.  Harold talks over the scene as the alien raises a cigarette to his mouth and takes a drag.  He leaves it in his mouth as Harold looks on in awe.  Chrissy wakes and looks at the Abducted Smoking Alien.)\r\n\r\n CHRISSY GIORGIO: What, what's happening?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Don't worry, it'll okay.  I'm here to protect you.  I'll never let anything happen to you.\r\n\r\n (The roof of the cell slides open and a bright light shines down.  The behemoth roars and she screams as she is pulled from the cage.  The doors slide shut.  Her screams drift off.  Cut to the interrogation room.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: What was the other alien, the gray, what was it doing during all this.\r\n\r\n (Scully walks up behind Harold.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: He was just... talking.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Telepathically?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: No.  In english.  He just kept saying the same thing over and over again.\r\n\r\n (Cut to the Abducted Smoking Alien, who has his head in his hands.)\r\n\r\n ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN: This is not happening.  This is not happening.  This is not happening.  This is not happening...\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: Would you shut up already?\r\n\r\n (The roof to Harold's cell slide open again and he is pulled out as the behemoth roars.)\r\n\r\n No!  No!\r\n\r\n (The doors slam shut.)\r\n\r\n ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN: This is not happening.  This is not happening.\r\n\r\n (Cut back to the interrogation room.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: I don't know where I was taken, because the whole time I was like this, in pain.\r\n\r\n (He shows how he held up his arms to block the shots.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Because the other alien was conducting torturous experiments on you?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: No... no, it was like... you know, you know when you were a kid and you tore the legs off a bug for no reason?  I guess I was the bug.  Anyways, the next thing I remember, I was suddenly outside... like I was flying through the air or something.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Then what?\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: And then I think I hit the ground.  When I came to, I, I immediately ran to Chrissy's to make sure she was there and that she was okay.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Harold... did you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse that night?\r\n\r\n (Harold looks away.)\r\n\r\n HAROLD LAMB: If her father finds out, I'm a dead man.\r\n\r\n (Later, the agents sit across from each other in the empty room.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: He said it happened before the abduction.  So what if they had sex?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: So we know that it wasn't an alien who probed her.  Mulder, you've got two kids having sex before they're mature enough to know how to handle it.\r\n\r\n MULDER: So you're saying that all this is just a case of sexual trauma?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: It's a lot more plausible than an alien abduction, especially in light of their contradictory stories.\r\n\r\n (Manners barges in.)\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Hey!  I just got a call from some crazy bleep-head saying he was an eyewitness to this alien abduction.  Do you feel like talking to this blank-hole?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 5 \r\n ROKY CRIKENSON'S HOUSE\r\n (Roky is sitting at his artist's desk in the basement, papers in front of him.  Mulder and Scully are standing on either side of him.)\r\n\r\n ROKY CRIKENSON: I know how crazy all this sounds, but I don't care. "

Nothing physical, they just mess with their minds.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Hypnosis.\r\n\r\n (Schaffer nods.)\r\n\r\n JACK SCHAFFER: At the base, I've seen people go into an ordinary room with an ordinary bunch of doctors... and come out absolutely positive they were probed by aliens.\r\n\r\n MULDER: But if abductions are just a covert intelligence operation and UFOs are merely secret military airships, piloted by aliens such as yourself... then what were you abducted by?\r\n\r\n JACK SCHAFFER: Don't you get it?  I'm absolutely positive me, my copilot, and those two kids were abducted but I can't be absolutely sure it happened.  I can't be sure of anything anymore!\r\n\r\n MULDER: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n JACK SCHAFFER: I'm not sure we're even having this conversation.  I don't know if these mashed potatoes are really here.  I don't know if you even exist.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I can only assure you that I do.\r\n\r\n JACK SCHAFFER: Well... thanks, buddy.  Unfortunately...  I can't give you the same assurance about me.\r\n\r\n (The door slams.  Mulder and Jack look over to see a number of soldiers being led by the Air Force Man.  Jack takes a drag of his cigarette and prepares to leave.)\r\n\r\n Well, looks like I'm a dead man.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Wait a minute, wait a minute.  It can't all be fake memory implantations.  What about that third alien?  What, what was that thing?\r\n\r\n JACK SCHAFFER: Who?  Lord Kinbote?\r\n\r\n (He stands.)\r\n\r\n SOLDIER: Right, come on.\r\n\r\n (Everybody walks out but Mulder.  Cut to the X-Files office.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: That is odd.  Because almost every day I was there, I ate lunch at that diner and became dear friends with the cook.  He told me a story about the night you're talking about.\r\n\r\n (He looks at another set of notes.  Cut back to the diner.  The neon sign now says \"Ovaltine.\"  Mulder walks in.  Chung talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n A man walked into his place...\r\n\r\n MULDER: Sweet potato pie.\r\n\r\n (Chung continues talking.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Sat down, ordered sweet potato pie, identified himself as F.B.I.  Agent Mulder.\r\n\r\n (Mulder sits and holds up his badge towards... us, effectively breaking down the fourth wall.  The cook walks over and takes out a piece of pie.)\r\n\r\n He then questioned my friend.\r\n\r\n (The cook puts down a piece of pie in front of Mulder.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: You ever seen a UFO in these parts?\r\n\r\n (Mulder takes a huge bite.  The cook watches him.

Mulder digs into another piece of pie.)\r\n\r\n Have you checked everywhere?\r\n\r\n (The cook looks at him.  Mulder stands and puts a bill down on the counter.  Chung talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: He ate a whole pie in that fashion, then got up and left.  My friend never saw him again.\r\n\r\n (Mulder leaves.)\r\n\r\n The cook never mentioned Lieutenant Schaffer, let alone any other Air Force personnel.\r\n\r\n (Cut back to the X-Files office.  Scully is placid.)\r\n\r\n You seem non-nonplused by these contradictions?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, not after what happened when Mulder left the diner and got back to the motel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 9 \r\n SCULLY'S MOTEL ROOM\r\n (Mulder knocks on the door to Scully's room, number seventeen.  The door swings open as he does.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Scully?\r\n\r\n (Mulder sees the second man in black sitting on the bed, facing away.  The first man in black is looking through her dresser.  Mulder whips out his gun.)\r\n\r\n Where's Scully?\r\n\r\n 1ST MAN IN BLACK: Oh.  She, uh... she went to get some ice.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Where is she?!\r\n\r\n (Mulder is quite angry.

She puts it down on the nightstand.)\r\n\r\n Scully, what's going on here?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Mulder, these gentlemen have something very important to tell you.\r\n\r\n (The first man in black walks towards Mulder.)\r\n\r\n 1ST MAN IN BLACK: Some alien encounters are hoaxes perpetrated by your government to manipulate the public.  Some of these hoaxes are intentionally revealed to manipulate the truth-seekers who become discredited if they disclose the deliberately absurd deception.\r\n\r\n (Mulder puts the gun away and walks to the man.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Similar things are said about the men in black.  That they purposely dress and behave strangely so that if anyone tries to describe an encounter with them, they come off sounding like a lunatic.\r\n\r\n 1ST MAN IN BLACK: I find absolutely no reason why anyone would think you crazy if you described this meeting of ours.\r\n\r\n (The second man in black puts his hand on Mulder's shoulder.  He bears an uncanny resemblance to Alex Trebek.)\r\n\r\n 2ND MAN IN BLACK: You're feeling very sleepy, very... relaxed.\r\n\r\n (Chung talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Alex Trebek?\r\n\r\n (Cut to the X-Files office.)\r\n\r\n The game show host?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Mulder didn't say that it was Alex Trebek.  It was just someone that looked incredibly like him.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Did he?  I mean, you were there.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, not exactly, I'm...  I don't have any recollection of this.  I.. .  was surprised to wake up the next morning with Mulder asleep in my room.\r\n\r\n (Cut back to the motel room.  Scully is under the covers in her bed, Mulder is sitting in the opposite one.)\r\n\r\n But, Mulder... I, I don't even remember letting you in.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I told you, you didn't let me in.  They were already here.\r\n\r\n (The phone rings.  Scully answers.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Scully.  We'll be right there.\r\n\r\n (Mulder dips his hands in the ice bucket, finding water instead.  Scully hangs up.)\r\n\r\n That was Detective Manners.  He said they just found your bleeping UFO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 10 \r\n WRECKAGE SITE\r\n (Mulder, Scully and Manners walk towards a downed plane.  Soldiers are all over the place.  A number of them carry out a body on a sheet.)\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Apparently, that was the cause of all those UFO sightings three nights ago.  They refused our assistance because it's some kind of top secret, experimental plane.\r\n\r\n (They stop walking.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: They don't want assistance.  They want witnesses to their alibi.\r\n\r\n (The officers carrying the body walk by.)\r\n\r\n OFFICER: Excuse me, ma'am.\r\n\r\n (Mulder looks at the body of Jack Schaffer.  He runs after them.  Another group of men pass carrying the body of Robert Vallee.)\r\n\r\n MANNERS: Hey!  That was the guy that was...\r\n\r\n (Scully looks at him and runs off after them.  Manners looks at the deserted wreckage.)\r\n\r\n Bleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 11 \r\n X-FILES OFFICE;  FBI HEADQUARTERS;  WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n (Chung dots the last period harshly and glares at Scully.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: I know it probably doesn't have the sense of closure that you want... but it has more than some of our other cases.\r\n\r\n (Chung closes his notebook.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 12 \r\n JOSE CHUNG'S OFFICE\r\n (Chung is typing on the typewriter.  He hears murmuring outside and sees a silhouette in his window.  He takes out his gun and slowly makes his way to the door.  He opens it to see Mulder and another man starting off.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder?\r\n\r\n (He motions for him to come in.  Mulder looks at the other man.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Thanks.\r\n\r\n (Mulder walks in and Chung closes the door.  They stand opposite each other at the desk.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: What can I do for you, Agent Mulder?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Don't write this book.\r\n\r\n (Chung sits.  Mulder walks over to the left and stands next to a small dresser with books.)\r\n\r\n You'll perform a disservice through a field of inquiry that has always struggled for respectability.  You're a gifted writer, but no amount of talent could describe the events that occurred in any realistic vein because they deal with alternative realities that we've yet to comprehend.  And when presented in the wrong way, in the wrong context, the incidents and the people involved in them can appear foolish, if not downright psychotic.\r\n\r\n (He walks back to the right, in front of Chung's desk.)\r\n\r\n I also know that your publishing house is owned by Warden White, Incorporated... a subsidiary of MacDougall-Kesler, which makes me suspect a covert agenda for your book on the part of the military-industrial-entertainment complex.\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder, this book will be written.  But it can only benefit if you can explain something to me.\r\n\r\n MULDER: What's that?\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: What really happened to those kids on that night?\r\n\r\n (Mulder looks down.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: How the hell should I know?\r\n\r\n (Chung stands in anger.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder, I appreciate this little visit but I have deadlines to face.\r\n\r\n (Mulder stares at him for a second, then walks out as Chung sits back down.  Chung starts to type again, but stops and looks at the door.  He talks over the scene.)\r\n\r\n Evidence of extraterrestrial existence remains as elusive as ever...\r\n\r\n (Cut to Blaine, pointing his flashlight to the sky as he is lifted up on the electric company crane.  Chung continues to talk.)\r\n\r\n ...but the skies will continue to be searched by the likes of Blaine Faulkner, hoping to someday find not only proof of alien life, but also contentment on a new world.  Until then, he must be content with his new job.\r\n\r\n (Blaine screams as sparks fly off of the electric pole.  Cut to El Cajon, California.  A group of people sit on the floor, gathered around Roky, who is standing in front of a strange diagram of the earth with a triangle in the middle, much like an Egyptian pyramid.  The triangle has an eye in each corner and clouds in the middle.  Roky is wearing a crystal necklace.  Chung continues to talk from his book.)\r\n\r\n Others search for answers from within.  Roky relocated to El Cajon, California, preaching to the lost and desperate.\r\n\r\n ROKY CRIKENSON: And so, at each death, the soul descends further into the inner earth, attaining ever greater levels of purification, reaching... enlightenment at the core.  Assuming, of course, that your soul is able to avoid... the lava men.\r\n\r\n (He holds his crystal.  Cut to the X-Files office, where she is reading Jose Chung's new book, \"From Outer Space.\"  Chung talks over.)\r\n\r\n JOSE CHUNG: Seeking the truth about aliens means a perfunctory nine-to-five job to some.

        "text":" But he’s not stupid – well, actually, he is, but anyway, assuming it was D’Alessio who tried to have Frank Bellarosa killed at Giulio’s in the presence of Frank’s wife and two upstanding citizens, then D’Alessio understands that he himself has broken the rules.  And he knows that Anthony does not play by many rules anyway.  So, D’Alessio does have one bodyguard with him outside of Giovanni’s, and D’Alessio is wearing a Kevlar vest under his Big and Tall Man suit, and he’s also carrying a.38 caliber Smith amp;  Wesson, and he’s got his family with him so he’s not expecting trouble, but he’s prepared for it.”\r\n I commented, “Well, he should have expected it and been better prepared.”\r\n “Correct.  The bodyguard, who Marie D’Alessio described to us as their driver – though they walked to the restaurant – took a longer walk, and seems to have disappeared.  As for the Kevlar vest, apparently the two shooters knew or anticipated this, so the first blast was aimed at D’Alessio’s face.”  He reminisced, “Frank Bellarosa got very lucky that night, but Mr. D’Alessio’s assailants were not going to repeat the mistake of Mr. Bellarosa’s assailants.”\r\n “No.  That would be stupid,” I agreed.\r\n Mr. Mancuso continued, “Well, that single blast to D’Alessio’s face knocked him onto the floor, whereupon one more shot was fired into his head, though he was undoubtedly already fatally wounded, according to what the medical examiner is telling me.”  He added, “That second shot was… well, a personal message.”  He explained, “There is no undertaker who could rebuild that head and face for an open casket.”\r\n Too much information.\r\n Mr. Mancuso continued, “As these two shots were fired, the second assailant pointed a shotgun at Marie D’Alessio’s head and shouted, ‘Nobody move or she dies,’ so the two sons sat there, frozen, according to witnesses, but Marie was screaming.  Then the two men left and got into a waiting car.”  He concluded, “From the time the two men walked in to the time they walked out was about fifteen seconds.”  He added, “Marie, when she looked at her husband, fainted.  One of the sons threw up, and the other son became hysterical.”  He said, as if to himself, “Happy Father’s Day.”\r\n I nodded.  Well, that certainly put my stressful day with Harriet and the Stanhopes into perspective.\r\n I tried to picture this scene of a restaurant on Father’s Day, filled with families, and two men coming through the door, and before anyone even knows what’s happening, one of them blows Salvatore D’Alessio’s head off, after wishing him a happy Father’s Day.  What was the D’Alessio family doing in that few seconds before Sal’s head and their world exploded?  Talking?  Laughing?  Passing the pastry?  Did Salvatore D’Alessio know, in that second before the blast, that it was over for him?\r\n I remembered how fast it had happened in front of Giulio’s – actually, I didn’t realize what was happening until it was almost over.  With no point of reference in my life, my brain did not comprehend what my eyes were seeing.  In fact, it didn’t even register when Vinnie’s face disappeared in a cloud of blood, brains-\r\n “Mr.  Sutter?”\r\n “Yes…”\r\n “I said, you may not want Mrs. Sutter to see this on TV.”\r\n I glanced at Susan, who was curled up on the couch, staring off into space.  I replied, “Right.”\r\n “And perhaps you should not have any of the tabloids lying around tomorrow.”\r\n “Right… well, I guess that answers the question of whether or not Anthony Bellarosa is alive.”\r\n “Correct.  I think we should assume that he ordered the hit.”  He pointed out, “It seems like the kind of message he would want to send to his uncle’s colleagues.  Meaning, this is what happened to my father in front of my mother.”\r\n “Right… well, I wouldn’t have given Anthony that much credit for showmanship, or symbolic acts, but maybe he does have a little of his father in him.”  So maybe he could appreciate my act of slashing his painting;  his father would have.\r\n Mr. Mancuso stayed silent a moment, then said, “I, too, was surprised at how the hit went down.  I had expected something… quieter.  A disappearance, so as not to draw the full attention of the law, or too much public attention.  Or, if it was going to be violent, then I didn’t think Anthony would make it so obvious that he was behind it.”  He added, “He might as well have had the killer say, ‘Happy Father’s Day, Uncle Sal. ’” He speculated, “This hit may cause him some problems.  And that brings us to another subject.”  I didn’t respond, so he went on, “It is possible, as we’ve discussed, that Anthony will now turn his attention to Mrs. Sutter, and possibly to you.”\r\n I glanced again at Susan, who was now looking at me.  She needed to hear this, so I hit the speaker button, replaced the receiver, and said to Mancuso, “Susan is back.”\r\n He said to us, “Based on the usual modus operandi, I’m fairly certain that Anthony Bellarosa is, and has been, out of town for this last week, and he can document this when we ask him where he was on the night of his uncle’s murder.  In any case, wherever he is, my guess is that he will stay put for another week or so, or at least until he’s certain that he’s coming home as the undisputed boss.”  He concluded, “Probably he’ll wait until after his uncle’s funeral, though he may actually show up for that.”\r\n I pointed out, “Well, he should if he was the cause of the funeral.”\r\n He allowed himself a small chuckle, but Susan didn’t smile.\r\n He went back to the more immediate subject and informed us, “Anthony’s absence, however, does not preclude him from taking care of business here, as Mr. D’Alessio’s murder obviously demonstrates.  In fact, if there is any more such business, it may be done while Anthony Bellarosa is still out of town.”\r\n Susan thought about that, then asked, “So what do you suggest we do?”\r\n “I suggest taking extra precautions, including hiring a personal bodyguard.”\r\n I pointed out, “That didn’t help Uncle Sal.”\r\n “No, it didn’t.  But hopefully your bodyguard will not be working for the other team as D’Alessio’s was.  Also, I’d advise you both to stay within your security zone at Stanhope Hall as much as possible.  Meanwhile, I’m asking the county police to see if they can assign you a twenty-four-hour protection detail.  Also, I’ve asked if the Bureau can assign one or two agents to you, but quite frankly, we’re shorthanded since 9/11.”\r\n Susan looked at me, then asked Mancuso, “How long are we supposed to live like this?”\r\n He replied, “I wish I could tell you.”  He tried out some good news and said, “Bellarosa will surface soon, or we will find him.  And when that happens, the NYPD will take him in for questioning regarding the murder of Salvatore D’Alessio, and the FBI will assist if requested.  The county police will also speak to him about the threats he’s made against both of you.  With any luck, as I’ve said, we can make an arrest.  At the least, we can make sure he’s on notice and under constant surveillance.”  He reminded us, “The problem now is that he’s missing.  And missing people, if they’re not dead, are more dangerous than people who are present and accounted for.”\r\n Susan had believed that it was good that Anthony Bellarosa was missing, but now she understood the problem with that.  She asked, “Why can’t you find him?”\r\n Mr. Mancuso, who’d probably answered this question many times, replied, “It’s a big country, and a big world.”  He added, “He has the resources to remain missing indefinitely.”  He reminded us, “He’s not a fugitive from the law, so we’re assuming that he’ll just appear when he thinks it’s best for him to do so.”\r\n What Felix Mancuso said sounded logical, of course, and certainly if I were Anthony Bellarosa, I’d be more worried about my paesanos and the law than thinking about killing any more people – especially people who, for all he knew, were being protected by the police and the FBI.  And yet… I knew, deep inside, that this had more to do with revenge than business, and that the revenge murder of Salvatore D’Alessio was just the first of two.  Maybe three.\r\n I had a thought, and I said to Mancuso, “I have business in London…” I glanced at Susan, who was nodding – “so, I’m thinking that this might be a good time for me and Mrs. Sutter to take a week or so in London, and then maybe a week or two on the Continent.”  I added, “In other words, we, too, should go missing.”\r\n He replied without hesitation, “That would be a very good idea at this time – until the situation here becomes more clear.”  He added, “If you stay in touch with us, we can keep you up to date on developments.”\r\n “We’ll certainly be interested in news from home.  And please don’t hesitate to call us the moment Sally Da-da’s friends whack Anthony.”\r\n Mr. Mancuso never responded well to my murderous remarks regarding Anthony Bellarosa – he was a professional – but he did say, “We’re hoping to locate him first.”\r\n “I hope Uncle Sal’s friends locate him first.”\r\n He ignored that and asked me, “When do you plan on leaving?”\r\n I looked at Susan, and she said, “Tuesday is fine with me.”\r\n Mancuso agreed, “That would be good.”  He reminded us, “Keep the particulars of your itinerary to yourselves.”\r\n “We will.”\r\n “And enjoy yourselves.  You need a break.”\r\n Mr. Mancuso seemed happy that we were getting out of his bailiwick.  Again, he liked us, and he would be personally saddened if we got whacked.  And professionally, of course, he would be more than saddened;  he would be in the same embarrassing situation he’d been in when Susan whacked his star witness.  He certainly didn’t need that aggravation again.\r\n He assured us, “I’m confident that we will catch some breaks while you’re gone, and that Anthony Bellarosa will be either in jail, under tight surveillance, killed by his own people, or frightened into permanent retirement and relocated to Florida or Vegas, where many of his colleagues wind up when they need to give up the business.”\r\n I wasn’t so sure about Anthony retiring and moving away, but I did agree with Felix Mancuso that Anthony’s career was at a crossroads.  Not my problem, as long as none of those roads led back to Grace Lane.\r\n I thought, too, of Anthony in hiding, or in exile, and I wondered if he had normal human feelings of missing his family, and not knowing when or if he’d see them again.  On the other hand, this was the life he’d chosen.  And then, of course, I thought about my own exile.  That was not the life I’d chosen – well, maybe it was – but it wasn’t my first choice.\r\n Anyway, Anthony Bellarosa didn’t even know where London was, and he thought Paris was the name of a Vegas hotel.  So this was a good idea, and we’d have fun while Anthony was trying to figure out if he was the boss, or if he was in trouble.\r\n I said to Mr. Mancuso, “We’ll call you Tuesday from the airport.”\r\n “Please do.”\r\n I asked him, “Other than being called to the scene of a murder, did you have a good Father’s Day?”\r\n “I did, thank you.  And how about you?”\r\n “I had a wonderful day with my children, and my fiancée.”  I added, “My mother and future in-laws were here, too.”  I informed him, “Everyone will be out of here by tomorrow morning.”\r\n “That’s good.”  He asked us, “Are you being… cautious?”\r\n “We are,” I assured him.  “However, Susan and I did go to Giulio’s for coffee and pastry on Thursday.”\r\n “Did you?  Well… that was probably a good thing.”\r\n “It was, actually.”\r\n He stayed quiet a moment, then said to me, or really to us, “I’ve often wondered… what would have been different in all our lives if you hadn’t stopped him from bleeding to death.”\r\n “Well… you can be sure I’ve wondered about that myself a few times.”  I glanced at Susan, who wasn’t looking at me, and said, “But I would never have let him bleed to death.”\r\n “I know that.  And neither would I.  But I mean, if you couldn’t have saved his life, and he’d died then and there… well, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”\r\n “We would not.”  And Susan wouldn’t have killed Frank on Felix Mancuso’s watch, and I wouldn’t have divorced her and been in self-exile for ten years, and Anthony would not now be a threat to our lives.  But who knows if something worse might have happened in these last ten years?  Like me running off with Beryl Carlisle.  I said to Felix Mancuso, but also for Susan, “Well, if we believe in a divine plan, maybe this is going to have a better ending than if Frank Bellarosa had lost one more pint of blood on the floor in Giulio’s restaurant.”\r\n He stayed quiet a moment, then said to me, and to Susan, “I’ve thought the same thing.  I really believe that… well, that there is a purpose to all this, and that part of that purpose is to test us, and to impart some wisdom to us, and to show us what is important, and to make us better people.”\r\n Susan said, “I believe that.  And I believe that we have a guardian angel who will watch over us.”\r\n Well, then, I thought, why bother to go to London?  But to be on the team, I said, “Me, too.”\r\n Mr. Mancuso said, “Someone here needs to speak to me.  Have a good trip, and don’t hesitate to call me anytime.”\r\n “Thank you,” I replied, “and have a good evening.”\r\n “Well…”\r\n “Right.  Then have a good day tomorrow.”\r\n “You, too.”\r\n Susan said, “And thank you.”\r\n I hung up, and we looked at each other.\r\n Finally, Susan said, “I, too, wonder how our lives would have been if I hadn’t-”\r\n “Stop.  We will never – and I mean never – discuss that again.”\r\n Susan nodded.  “All right.  But maybe there really is a purpose to what happened.”\r\n “Maybe.” "
