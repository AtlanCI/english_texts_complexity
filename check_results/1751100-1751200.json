where I\r\n 0:07\r\n get an upgrade so I ended up actually\r\n 0:11\r\n getting a new computer and so because of\r\n 0:14\r\n that all of my videos from now on should\r\n 0:16\r\n be in a solid 60 frames per second 1080p\r\n 0:19\r\n resolution previously all of my videos\r\n 0:21\r\n were in a 30 FPS state but now there\r\n 0:26\r\n should be 60fps 1080p resolution and I\r\n 0:29\r\n also got a new microphone so hopefully\r\n 0:31\r\n you guys notice the quality difference\r\n 0:34\r\n between my old microphone and my new\r\n 0:36\r\n microphone be sure to let me know anyway\r\n 0:39\r\n let's go ahead and get started with this\r\n 0:40\r\n tutorial so in this tutorial I'm going\r\n 0:42\r\n to be discussing how to use buffers in\r\n 0:45\r\n fin so we've discussed several\r\n 0:47\r\n advantages and disadvantages of them\r\n 0:49\r\n well not many disadvantages because\r\n 0:51\r\n they're definitely aren't many\r\n 0:53\r\n disadvantages of using them but one of\r\n 0:55\r\n the hardest parts about using vim is\r\n 0:56\r\n doing things that you would normally do\r\n 0:58\r\n with the mouse for one of the examples\r\n 1:00\r\n of that would be creating new tabs or\r\n 1:02\r\n just managing different types of files\r\n 1:05\r\n so in this tutorial I'm going to teach\r\n 1:07\r\n you all about buffers windows and tabs\r\n 1:10\r\n so what are these things so the buffer\r\n 1:14\r\n is essentially the window that's a bad\r\n 1:18\r\n term for it the buffer is essentially an\r\n 1:20\r\n open file let's just say alright so in\r\n 1:23\r\n this window here I'm actually going to\r\n 1:26\r\n go ahead and create a file hello world\r\n 1:28\r\n I'm going to go ahead and write this\r\n 1:30\r\n file as hello world of txt so we don't\r\n 1:34\r\n have this file this is hello world in it\r\n 1:36\r\n so this file since it's one file\r\n 1:38\r\n actually has a corresponding buffer with\r\n 1:40\r\n in vim so and this buffer is being\r\n 1:46\r\n displayed on this single window here on\r\n 1:48\r\n the screen so there are several things\r\n 1:50\r\n that we can actually do in order to\r\n 1:52\r\n change around the viewing of this so say\r\n 1:55\r\n we want to edit this hello world file\r\n 1:56\r\n but we don't want to change our current\r\n 1:59\r\n position in the window so in order to do\r\n 2:02\r\n this we can actually split the window in\r\n 2:04\r\n half so in order to split the window all\r\n 2:08\r\n we have to do is type the colon the\r\n 2:10\r\n colon split command\r\n 2:11\r\n and if we do that that it actually\r\n 2:13\r\n splits the window into as you can see\r\n 2:15\r\n there's two buffers open containing the\r\n 2:18\r\n same file the buffer actually has the\r\n 2:20\r\n file name at the bottom so we now have a\r\n 2:23\r\n split window with two copies of the same\r\n 2:26\r\n file now in order to actually switch\r\n 2:28\r\n from window to window we're going to use\r\n 2:30\r\n the ctrl w modifier so we type in\r\n 2:35\r\n control w and then we can actually go\r\n 2:37\r\n ahead and use the regular standard vm\r\n 2:40\r\n navigation command so if we type ctrl w\r\n 2:42\r\n j we move down up a window and if we\r\n 2:46\r\n type control w k we move up a window see\r\n 2:51\r\n how simple that is now we can actually\r\n 2:53\r\n take a window and we can split it in\r\n 2:55\r\n another way as well so we can use DV\r\n 2:57\r\n split command to actually split the\r\n 2:59\r\n window vertically so if we do this it's\r\n 3:02\r\n going to actually split our current\r\n 3:03\r\n window vertically and then we can go\r\n 3:05\r\n ahead and navigate to this window by\r\n 3:06\r\n using the ctrl w and the hnl command so\r\n 3:10\r\n we can type in control WL control really\r\n 3:12\r\n k and then we're able to successfully\r\n 3:14\r\n navigate around these windows now this\r\n 3:19\r\n of course the alternative of this would\r\n 3:21\r\n be using the mouse and clicking on the\r\n 3:22\r\n separate windows however in vim\r\n 3:24\r\n everything is faster using the keyboard\r\n 3:26\r\n so because these are all the same file\r\n 3:29\r\n we can actually edit one of these copies\r\n 3:31\r\n and all of them will change so I'm just\r\n 3:33\r\n going to go ahead and take this file\r\n 3:34\r\n here go down to the tenth line well\r\n 3:36\r\n actually I'm going to create 10 new\r\n 3:40\r\n lines here and then I'm just going to\r\n 3:41\r\n type hello Mars and as you can see the\r\n 3:48\r\n file contents and all of the files have\r\n 3:50\r\n changed now typing in the colon split\r\n 3:56\r\n and colon V split commands are actually\r\n 3:58\r\n kind of annoying so this could actually\r\n 4:00\r\n be short cut it by using the window\r\n 4:02\r\n modifier and the s and V commands so the\r\n 4:05\r\n window modifier is controlled w and if\r\n 4:07\r\n we actually type control w and then s\r\n 4:09\r\n you can see that it just goes ahead and\r\n 4:11\r\n splits the window same thing with\r\n 4:13\r\n control WV it just creates a simple\r\n 4:16\r\n vertical split so now we have this crazy\r\n 4:18\r\n hierarchy of all of these copies of the\r\n 4:21\r\n same file and we can go ahead\r\n 4:23\r\n and navigate them all and see that they\r\n 4:26\r\n are actually all same file very\r\n 4:32\r\n interesting so we just have a huge\r\n 4:34\r\n collection here of all of these files so\r\n 4:38\r\n since each window corresponds to its own\r\n 4:44\r\n so each window is its own little\r\n 4:46\r\n operating area so in order to actually\r\n 4:48\r\n execute commands on the window all we\r\n 4:50\r\n need to do is make sure that our cursor\r\n 4:51\r\n is in the window and then we can go\r\n 4:53\r\n ahead and execute colon commands so if\r\n 4:55\r\n we want to exit one window we move the\r\n 4:57\r\n cursor to the window we want to open and\r\n 4:58\r\n then we execute the colon command that\r\n 5:01\r\n we want to execute so in this case I\r\n 5:03\r\n want to quit this window and we're\r\n 5:05\r\n actually in the long bar in the middle\r\n 5:06\r\n here so I'm just going to type colon Q\r\n 5:08\r\n and it goes head and quits that window\r\n 5:10\r\n now if I want to quit all the windows I\r\n 5:13\r\n would go ahead and type in control q a\r\n 5:16\r\n or colon QA and that stands for quit all\r\n 5:20\r\n however we can also use the window\r\n 5:22\r\n modifier to close windows by typing in\r\n 5:24\r\n control WC and that just controller that\r\n 5:28\r\n just closes a window so as you can see\r\n 5:31\r\n navigating with windows is pretty easy\r\n 5:33\r\n in vim now we could also navigate with\r\n 5:37\r\n windows by opening new files so say we\r\n 5:40\r\n want to create a hello Morris file to\r\n 5:43\r\n contain the hello Mars line and we want\r\n 5:44\r\n to delete it entirely from the hello\r\n 5:46\r\n world so we can go ahead and type v\r\n 5:48\r\n split hello Mars txt and that inside of\r\n 5:52\r\n hello Mars we're just going to go over\r\n 5:54\r\n to hello world yank that our delete cut\r\n 5:57\r\n the hell of our slide paste it into this\r\n 5:59\r\n one delete this first line we're going\r\n 6:04\r\n to go ahead and delete all of that white\r\n 6:05\r\n space from the hello world file and\r\n 6:07\r\n we're just going to save them all\r\n 6:13\r\n so as you can see we just created two\r\n 6:16\r\n separate files and these are delineated\r\n 6:17\r\n by the little buffer status bars on the\r\n 6:19\r\n bottom which contain the name of the\r\n 6:22\r\n files that we want to create so this is\r\n 6:26\r\n all this is all set and fine as long as\r\n 6:29\r\n we want to constantly be viewing what\r\n 6:31\r\n we're working on but say we don't\r\n 6:32\r\n actually one of you what we're working\r\n 6:34\r\n on all of the time so say for example we\r\n 6:37\r\n have a client application and a server\r\n 6:39\r\n application and although we're working\r\n 6:40\r\n on both at the same time we don't need\r\n 6:42\r\n to be viewing them side-by-side in fact\r\n 6:44\r\n we probably don't want to be viewing\r\n 6:46\r\n them side by that at all so in order to\r\n 6:49\r\n do this this type of functionality we\r\n 6:51\r\n can go ahead and use tabs so tabs in vim\r\n 6:54\r\n work just like tabs in your web browser\r\n 6:55\r\n of course back in the day tabs existed\r\n 6:58\r\n before tabs did in the web browser but\r\n 6:59\r\n now I can use that analogy so in order\r\n 7:02\r\n to create a new tab all we need to do is\r\n 7:04\r\n type in colon tab new and as you can see\r\n 7:07\r\n this creates a nice new tab at the top\r\n 7:09\r\n and inside of this tab there is a buffer\r\n 7:12\r\n so we can go ahead and pull the file\r\n 7:13\r\n into the buffer by using the colon II\r\n 7:15\r\n command and then just pull the file so\r\n 7:18\r\n I'm going to eat polo hello mrs txt and\r\n 7:20\r\n as you can see hello Mars is now inside\r\n 7:23\r\n of this tab now just like with any other\r\n 7:26\r\n window we can go ahead and V split this\r\n 7:28\r\n tab or split the tab by using all of our\r\n 7:31\r\n new window functionality and it's just\r\n 7:35\r\n like our own little working space which\r\n 7:37\r\n is perfect if we want to manage a single\r\n 7:38\r\n file here and a single file on the other\r\n 7:40\r\n tab now what if we want to switch tabs\r\n 7:44\r\n so in order to do that we would type in\r\n 7:46\r\n the colon tab p here and that stands for\r\n 7:49\r\n tab previous so once we do that we can\r\n 7:51\r\n see that it moves over to our first tab\r\n 7:54\r\n which we're then going to quit out of\r\n 7:56\r\n the hello Mars window so now we have a\r\n 7:59\r\n tab for managing hello world txt and\r\n 8:02\r\n hello Marcy XD so now if we want to\r\n 8:05\r\n switch back to our hello Mars tab here\r\n 8:07\r\n we type in tab n which you guessed it\r\n 8:09\r\n stands for tab next which will actually\r\n 8:12\r\n move our tab forward so this is basic\r\n 8:16\r\n tab management in vim an easy way to\r\n 8:19\r\n manage multiple files multiple buffers\r\n 8:21\r\n whatever you want to manage\r\n 8:23\r\n so say we're done with hello Mars we've\r\n 8:25\r\n actually edited it and I'm going to go\r\n 8:27\r\n ahead and go to our biggest working\r\n 8:29\r\n space here and I'm going to create a few\r\n 8:32\r\n new lines and I'm just going to say this\r\n 8:34\r\n is truly a wonderful planet planet it\r\n 8:42\r\n contains canyons river valleys and giant\r\n 8:48\r\n ice sheets i'm quoting brian cox there\r\n 8:52\r\n if you were aware of that and actually i\r\n 8:54\r\n just duplicated this many times I'm\r\n 9:00\r\n actually not sure how I did that I think\r\n 9:06\r\n that I pressed a button on accident but\r\n 9:09\r\n you know what I will just go with it so\r\n 9:11\r\n I'm just going to go ahead and save that\r\n 9:12\r\n file by typing in control w here and as\r\n 9:15\r\n you can see we now have multiple windows\r\n 9:18\r\n containing the same file so I'm just\r\n 9:20\r\n going to close off all of these windows\r\n 9:21\r\n with having control WC and now we have\r\n 9:23\r\n one single window and now we have two\r\n 9:26\r\n tabs managing hello world and hello Mars\r\n 9:28\r\n so now that i'm done managing hello Mars\r\n 9:30\r\n I'm just going to go ahead and i'm\r\n 9:34\r\n typing control tab clothes or not\r\n 9:37\r\n control colon tab clothes here and that\r\n 9:40\r\n will go ahead and close our hello maersk\r\n 9:42\r\n one tab and then here once i have the\r\n 9:45\r\n hello world tab open the tab bar\r\n 9:48\r\n disappears since there's no other tabs\r\n 9:49\r\n and then we can pretty much exit to the\r\n 9:51\r\n program gracefully by typing in colon q\r\n 9:54\r\n and that is a basic window and basic tab\r\n 9:59\r\n management in vim now the functionality\r\n 10:01\r\n of using tabs and windows is definitely\r\n 10:04\r\n a lot more powerful than that for\r\n 10:07\r\n example you can go ahead and use tabs to\r\n 10:09\r\n find files and just open up all of the\r\n 10:11\r\n files matching that certain regular\r\n 10:14\r\n expression or you can use tabs to\r\n 10:16\r\n directly edit files from other tabs\r\n 10:17\r\n without even switching tabs but this was\r\n 10:20\r\n just a basic overview in order to give\r\n 10:23\r\n you a basic understanding of how to use\r\n 10:25\r\n tabs in bed so thank you for watching\r\n 10:27\r\n this tutorial I hope that you enjoyed if\r\n 10:29\r\n you have any questions please

        "text":"Indigenous Australian art, from the magical barks of the Yolngu to the mesmerising dot paintings of the Western Desert, grace the walls of opulent homes and legislatures, galleries and boardrooms from Sydney to New York City and beyond.\r\n\r\n But I’ve often wondered when I’ve viewed beautiful Indigenous cultural material on the walls of offices and private homes, whether those who’ve procured it have ever been anywhere near the communities that produce it.  Sure – it’s not a prerequisite to meet an artist before buying their work.  But in the case of non-Indigenous people acquiring pieces created by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artists the disconnect – cultural, economic, social, geographical – between buyer and creator can be profound.\r\n How do you buy Indigenous Australian art ethically?\r\n Read more\r\n\r\n This week the genesis of modern desert Indigenous art movements will receive fitting acknowledgment with the inclusion on the Unesco Australian Memory of the World register of Warlpiri crayon drawings created at Hooker Creek in 1953 and 1954.\r\n\r\n Anthropologist Mervyn Meggitt lived for 10 months at Hooker Creek (Lajamanu), on Gurindji land, to which the white authorities had forcibly moved the Warlpiri from their traditional country and settlement Yuendumu, hundreds of kilometres away in the Tanami Desert. \r\n\r\n He enlisted 21 men and three women to do crayon drawings of whatever they chose.  The Warlpiri, disconnected from – and desperately homesick for – their traditional lands, drew pictures associated with their country and their dreaming stories.  Many of the drawings had cosmological and ceremonial themes (a third relate to secret men’s business and cannot be publicly viewed), some focused on landscapes of the Tanami drawn from memory while others captured the new settlement.\r\n Advertisement\r\n\r\n Meggitt commissioned the drawings to facilitate his research into Warlpiri social organisation and kinship.  He deposited the drawings with the (then) Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in 1965 and, while he drew on their imparted knowledge for his seminal book, Desert People, he did not specifically reference them.  He later destroyed all of his Warlpiri research material before he died in 2004, apparently concerned that the material might be mis-used by other anthropologists and academics.\r\n\r\n His only remaining interpretations of the images is in a 1965 recorded interview;  not surprisingly later generations of Warlpiri who’ve become acquainted with the images, courtesy of the national Museum of Australia and contemporary anthropologist Melinda Hinkson, have sometimes challenged and taken exception to Meggitt’s take on them.\r\n\r\n It’s a curiosity of museological collection practices that, until quite recently, the drawings were known as the “Meggitt collection”;  colonialism, in Australia and the world over, not only denied the Indigenous their land – it also applied the nomenclature of the appropriators to their cultural property.\r\n\r\n But the Unesco listing, formalised on Thursday at the Canberra Museum and Gallery, affords further long-overdue acknowledgement to those Hooker’s Creek artists who, inspired by their introduction to a new medium for their storytelling, went on to form the vanguard of the Australian desert art movements. \r\n\r\n Meggitt, however, at times transcended a purely ethnographic approach to the drawings and saw some of them through the prism of their artistry.  He was especially taken with the drawings of Larry Jungarrayi and Abe Jangala, whose later work would become internationally renowned and highly valuable.\r\n Advertisement\r\n\r\n The Hooker’s Creek works of Jungarrayi and Jangala feature prominently among the collection of 169 drawings that has been accepted – due to its historical, aesthetic, social and spiritual significance – onto the Unesco register.\r\n\r\n Last week I visited the drawings in the archives of AIATSIS.  They reflect a broad range of technical abilities, but tell remarkable stories – in a fabulous palette of colour and using beautiful, and, to the untrained eye, intriguing, iconography – of tens of thousands of years of pre-colonial history, traditional law, the departure from country and the imposition of settlement life.\r\n\r\n There is a spearing at Yuendumu.  There are many devils, spirits (Jarnpa), serpents and marsupial footprints and trees – hundreds of trees!  – memorised from tens of thousands of years in the Tanami and re-imagined at Hooker Creek.\r\n\r\n The drawings are artistically significant because their existence dispels the misconception that the Central Desert art movement spontaneously happened at Papanya in 1971.  So, drawn 17 years before the first Papanya boards were painted, the Warlpiri crayons effectively represent the transition, in the desert, of ancient artistic expression (the finger-drawing in sand, for example) to the modern medium.\r\n\r\n Perhaps the image that has come to best characterise the “Warlpari Collection” (as it is now, appropriately, known) is Larry Jungarrayi’s The Superintendant’s House (main image).\r\n\r\n This drawing testifies to the different ways Indigenous people viewed (from the earth up) their world compared with white interlopers (from an elevated perspective) after early contact.\r\n The stories you need to read, in one handy email\r\n Read more\r\n\r\n In her remarkable 2014 book, Remembering the Future – Warlpiri Life Through The Prism Of Drawing, Hinkson recounts how Meggitt didn’t initially know what the drawing depicted.\r\n Advertisement\r\n\r\n She writes how, in his 1965 recorded interview, Meggitt said: “It looks like an aerial view of rice fields in green with black borders.  In fact it is Larry’s version of the superintendent’s house.  He said the most striking thing about the house was the flywire that screened it.  By drawing the flywire as he’s done, he’s indicated the house.”\r\n\r\n Hinkson describes the works as “remarkable time capsules”.\r\n\r\n “They mark a moment in the 1950s when Warlpiri were forcibly relocated to the new government settlement of Hooker Creek, on the lands of the Gurindji.  They give us a sense of what people were thinking about and what they cared about at this turbulent time – especially the cherished ancestral places they were now separated from and the ceremonial knowledge associated with those places.  Some drawings also indicate that Warlpiri were keeping a sharp watchful eye on the new world of the settlement that was unfolding around them,” she says.\r\n\r\n “It’s wonderful that the international significance of the drawings is being recognised by their addition to the Unesco register.”\r\n Long overlooked, Indigenous women’s art takes centre stage in Melbourne exhibition\r\n Read more\r\n\r\n But celebrations in Warlpiri country will be overshadowed by the tragic recent death of Larry Jungarayi’s granddaughter, who Hinkson describes as “a radiant woman of remarkable creative abilities who died far too young”.\r\n\r\n Which reinforces the point that the Indigenous Australian art we cherish can often, for its custodians and consumers, be disconnected for the poverty, hardship and anguish of those who create it.\r\n\r\n Hinkson says: “Moments like this sheet home to us a schism that is often apparent in Australian society between our reverence for certain forms of Aboriginal art on the one hand, and our continuing failure to shift the terms of engagement between the makers of that art on the other.”\r\n\r\n Other entries to the Unesco register, which honours documentary heritage of great significance to Australia, include: Dorothea Mackellar’s poem Core of My Heart (My Country;  the anthropological field research and teaching records of Sydney University (1926-1956);  and recordings of Fanny Cochrane Smith, the last fluent speaker of a Tasmanian Aboriginal language."

It’s awfully dark.”\r\n\r\n “Thanks.”\r\n\r\n Another long pause.  “I need to go,” she said.  “Mom’s ready for bed.”\r\n\r\n “Will you call tomorrow night?”\r\n\r\n “Yes.  Same time.”\r\n\r\n She hung up without a “goodbye” or “I love you” or anything.  Just hung up.\r\n\r\n Mitch pulled on his white athletic socks and tucked in his white long-sleeved T-shirt.  He locked the kitchen door and trotted down the dark street.  West Junior High School was six blocks to the east of East Meadowbrook.  Behind the redbrick classrooms and gymnasium was the baseball field, and farther away at the end of a dark driveway was the football field.  A cinder track circled the field, and was a favorite of local joggers.\r\n\r\n But not at 11 P.M., especially with no moon.  The track was deserted, and that was fine with Mitch.  The spring air was light and cool, and he finished the first mile in eight minutes.  He began walking a lap.  As he passed the aluminum bleachers on the home side, he saw someone from the corner of his eye.  He kept walking.\r\n\r\n “Pssssssst.”\r\n\r\n Mitch stopped.  “Yeah.  Who is it?”\r\n\r\n A hoarse, scratchy voice replied, “Joey Morolto.”\r\n\r\n Mitch started for the bleachers.  “Very funny, Tarrance.  Am I clean?”\r\n\r\n “Sure, you’re clean.  Laney’s sitting up there in a school bus with a flashlight.  He flashed green when you passed, and if you see something red flash, get back to the track and make like Carl Lewis.”\r\n\r\n They walked to the top of the bleachers and into the unlocked press box.  They sat on stools in the dark and watched the school.  The buses were parked in perfect order along the driveway.\r\n\r\n “Is this private enough for you?”  Mitch asked.\r\n\r\n “It’ll do.  Who’s the girl?”\r\n\r\n “I know you prefer to meet in daylight, preferably where a crowd has gathered, say like a fast-food joint or a Korean shoe store.  But I like these places better.”\r\n\r\n “Great.  Who’s the girl?”\r\n\r\n “Pretty clever, huh?”\r\n\r\n “Good idea.  Who is she?”\r\n\r\n “An employee of mine.”\r\n\r\n “Where’d you find her?”\r\n\r\n “What difference does it make?  Why are you always asking questions that are irrelevant?”\r\n\r\n “Irrelevant?  I get a call today from some woman I’ve never met, tells me she needs to talk to me about a little matter at the Bendini Building, says we gotta change phones, instructs me to go to a certain pay phone outside a certain grocery store and be there at a certain time, and she’ll call exactly at one-thirty.  And I go there, and she calls at exactly one-thirty.  Keep in mind, I’ve got three men within a hundred feet of the phone watching everybody that moves.  And she tells me to be here at exactly ten forty-five tonight, to have the place sealed off, and that you’ll come trotting by.”\r\n\r\n “Worked, didn’t it?”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, so far.  But who is she?  I mean, now you got someone else involved, and that really worries me, McDeere.  Who is she and how much does she know?”\r\n\r\n “Trust me, Tarrance.  She’s my employee and she knows everything.  In fact, if you knew what she knows you’d be serving indictments right now instead of sitting here bitching about her.”\r\n\r\n Tarrance breathed deeply and thought about it.  “Okay, so tell me what she knows.”\r\n\r\n “She knows that in the last three years the Morolto gang and its accomplices have taken over eight hundred million bucks in cash out of this country and deposited it in various banks in the Caribbean.  She knows which banks, which accounts, the dates, a bunch of stuff.  She knows that the Moroltos control at least three hundred and fifty companies chartered in the Caymans, and that these companies regularly send clean money back into the country.  She knows the dates and amounts of the wire transfers.  She knows of at least forty U.S. corporations owned by Cayman corporations owned by the Moroltos.  She knows a helluva lot, Tarrance.  She’s a very knowledgeable woman, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n Tarrance could not speak.  He stared fiercely into the darkness up the driveway.\r\n\r\n Mitch found it enjoyable.  “She knows how they take their dirty cash, trade it up to one-hundred-dollar bills and sneak it out of the country.”\r\n\r\n “How?”\r\n\r\n “Lear, of course.  But they also mule it.  They’ve got a small army of mules, usually their minimum-wage thugs and their girlfriends, but also students and other freelancers, and they’ll give them ninety-eight hundred in cash and buy them a ticket to the Caymans or the Bahamas.  No declarations are required for amounts under ten thousand, you understand.  And the mules will fly down like regular tourists with pockets full of cash and take the money to their banks.  Doesn’t sound like much money, but you get three hundred people making twenty trips a year, and that’s some serious cash walking out of the country.  It’s also called smurfing, you know.”\r\n\r\n Tarrance nodded slightly, as if he knew.\r\n\r\n “A lot of folks wanna be smurfers when they can get free vacations and spending money.  Then they’ve got their super mules.  These are the trusted Morolto people who take a million bucks in cash, wrap it up real neat in newspaper so the airport machines won’t see it, put it in big briefcases and walk it onto the planes like everybody else.  They wear coats and ties and look like Wall Streeters.  Or they wear sandals and straw hats and mule it in carry-on bags.  You guys catch them occasionally, about one percent of the time, I believe, and when that happens the super mules go to jail.  But they never talk, do they, Tarrance?  And every now and then a smurfer will start thinking about all this money in his briefcase and how easy it would be just to keep flying and enjoy all the money himself.  And he’ll disappear.  But the Mob never forgets, and it may take a year or two, but they’ll find him somewhere.  The money’ll be gone, of course, but then so will he.  The Mob never forgets, does it, Tarrance?  Just like they won’t forget about me.”\r\n\r\n Tarrance listened until it was obvious he needed to say something.  “You got your million bucks.”\r\n\r\n “Appreciate it.  I’m almost ready for the next installment.”\r\n\r\n “Almost?”\r\n\r\n “Yeah, me and the girl have a couple more jobs to pull.  We’re trying to get a few more records out of Front Street.”\r\n\r\n “How many documents do you have?”\r\n\r\n “Over ten thousand.”\r\n\r\n The lower jaw collapsed and the mouth fell open.  He stared at Mitch.  “Damn!  Where’d they come from?”\r\n\r\n “Another one of your questions.”\r\n\r\n “Ten thousand documents,” said Tarrance.\r\n\r\n “At least ten thousand.  Bank records, wire-transfer records, corporate charters, corporate loan documents, internal memos, correspondence between all sorts of people.  A lot of good stuff, Tarrance.”\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Emmanuel Macron neglected his own nation’s musical emblem as he walked out to deliver his victory speech, instead heralding his victory with the EU’s Anthem of Europe.\r\n\r\n In the past French politicians have announced their victory to the sound of La Marseillaise, which has stood as their anthem for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n But Mr Macron, who has gained support from major European figures including Jean-Claude Juncker and Angela Merkel, instead blasted the anthem of Europe ‘Ode to Joy’ from the speakers as he waved to adoring crowds of voters outside the Louvre museum.\r\n\r\n The show of allegiance with the faltering European project was condemned by the losing Front National, who have fought to remove France from the crumbling European bloc.\r\n\r\n Speaking to the public he said: “I’ll defend France, I’ll defend Europe, and will strengthen links between Europe and its people.”\r\n\r\n And while he later sang the French anthem with the crowd at the end of his speech, French voters on Twitter were quick to criticise his decision as a sign of European subservience.\r\n\r\n Written in 1824 by German Ludwig van Beethoven and based on a poem by countryman Friedrich Schiller in 1785, Ode to Joy was used as a stand in national anthem for Unified Team of Germany in the Olympics from 1956 to 1968, and later taken on by the EU in 1985.\r\n\r\n SNP MPs whistled then later sung the tune as a protest against Brexit in the House of Commons during the third reading of the Great Repeal Bill.\r\n\r\n It comes as British officials attempt to predict how the Europhile president will approach a Brexit deal.\r\n\r\n Mr Macron is a centrist populist who stands in favour of the European Union and has been a clear opponent of Brexit, branding it a “crime” in his manifesto.\r\n\r\n On the campaign trail, he said that Britain would face “consequences” for leaving the EU and promised to take a tough stance in the divorce negotiations.\r\n\r\n In February, Mr Macron said: “If your Government decides to organise a Brexit, I will be pretty tough on it.\r\n\r\n “We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequences.”\r\n\r\n He favours a hard Brexit which would leave Britain outside of the single market and protect the interests of EU members.\r\n\r\n He later added: “I am attached to a strict approach to Brexit.\r\n\r\n “I respect the British vote but the worst thing would be a sort of weak EU vis-a-vis the British.\r\n\r\n “I don’t want a tailor made approach where the British have the best of two worlds.\r\n\r\n “That will be too big an incentive for others to leave and kill the European idea, which is based on shared responsibilities"

        "text":"And we talked about the radius for the electron, so if there's a circle here, there's a radius for an electron in the ground state, this would be the radius of the first energy level, is equal to 5.3 times 10 to the negative 11 meters.\r\n 3:30.\r\n So if we wanted to know the diameter of that circle, we could just multiply the radius by two.\r\n 3:35.\r\n So two times that number would be equal to 1.06 times 10 to the negative 10 meters.\r\n 3:44.\r\n And this is just a rough estimate of the size of the hydrogen atom using the Bohr model, with an electron in the ground state.\r\n 3:52.\r\n Alright, we also did some calculations to figure out the velocity.\r\n 3:57.\r\n So the velocity of an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom using the Bohr model, we calculated that to be 2.2 times 10 to the six meters per second.\r\n 4:08.\r\n And since we know the mass of an electron, we can actually calculate the linear momentum.\r\n 4:12.\r\n So the linear momentum P is equal to the mass times the velocity.\r\n 4:16.\r\n Let's say we knew the velocity with a 10% uncertainty associated with that number.  So a 10% uncertainty.\r\n 4:26.\r\n If we convert that to a decimal, we just divide 10 by 100, so we get 10% is equal to point one.  So we have point one here.\r\n 4:35.\r\n If I want to know the uncertainty of the momentum of that electron, so the uncertainty in the momentum of that particle, momentum is equal to mass times velocity.\r\n 4:45.\r\n If there's a 10% uncertainty associated with the velocity, we need to multiply this by point one.\r\n 4:52.\r\n So let's go ahead and do that.\r\n 4:54.\r\n So we would have the mass of the electron is 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st.\r\n 5:02.\r\n The velocity of the electron is 2.2 times 10 to the sixth, and we know that with 10% uncertainty, so we need to multiply all of that by point one.\r\n 5:12.\r\n So let's go ahead and do that.\r\n 5:14.\r\n We're gonna multiply all those things together.\r\n 5:17.\r\n So we take the mass of an electron, 9.11 times 10 to the negative 31st and we multiply that by the velocity, 2.2 times 10 to the sixth, and we know there's a 10% uncertainty associated with the velocity, so we get an uncertainty in the momentum 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\r\n 5:40.\r\n So the uncertainty in the momentum is 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\r\n 5:47.\r\n And the units would be, this is the mass in kilograms, and the velocity was in meters over seconds, so kilograms times meters per second.\r\n 5:55.\r\n Alright, so this is the uncertainty associated with the momentum of our electrons.\r\n 6:02.\r\n Let's plug it in to our uncertainty principle here: we had the uncertainty in the position of the electron, times the uncertainty in the momentum of the electron must be greater than or equal to Planck's Constant divided by four pi.\r\n 6:19.\r\n So we can take that uncertainty in the momentum and we can plug it in here.\r\n 6:24.\r\n So now we have the uncertainty in the position of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom times 2.0 times 10 to the negative 25.\r\n 6:34.\r\n This product must be greater than or equal to, Planck's Constant is 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34.  Alright, divide that by four pi.\r\n 6:48.\r\n So we could solve for the uncertainty in the position.\r\n 6:52.\r\n So, Delta X must be greater than or equal to, let's go ahead and do that math.\r\n 6:58.\r\n So we have Planck's Constant, 6.626 times 10 to the negative 34, we divide that by 4, we need to divide that also by pi, and then we need to divide by the uncertainty in the momentum.\r\n 7:17.\r\n"

He slouched off moodily down the street, kicking a stone at a cat.\r\n Richard entered the building once more, mounted the stairs uneasily and looked again into the office.\r\n Dirk's secretary was sitting at her desk, head down, arms folded.\r\n 'I'm not here,' she said.\r\n 'I see,' said Richard.\r\n 'I only came back,' she said, without looking up from the spot on her desk at which she was staring angrily, 'to make sure he notices that I've gone.  Otherwise he might just forget.'\r\n 'Is he in?'  asked Richard.\r\n 'Who knows?  Who cares?  Better ask someone who works for him, because I don't.'\r\n 'Show him in!'  boomed Dirk's voice.\r\n She glowered for a moment, stood up, went to the inner door, wrenched it open, said 'Show him in yourself,' slammed the door once more and returned to her seat.\r\n 'Er, why don't I just show myself in?'  said Richard.\r\n 'I can't even hear you,' said Dirk's ex-secretary, staring resolutely at her desk.  'How do you expect me to hear you if I'm not even here?'\r\n Richard made a placatory gesture, which was ignored, and walked through and opened the door to Dirk's office himself.  He was startled to find the room in semi-darkness.  A blind was drawn down over the window, and Dirk was lounging back in his seat, his face bizarrely lit by the strange arrangement of objects sitting on the desk.  At the forward edge of the desk sat an old grey bicycle lamp, facing backwards and shining a feeble light on a metronome which was ticking softly back and forth, with a highly polished silver teaspoon strapped to its metal rod.\r\n Richard tossed a couple of boxes of matches on to the desk.\r\n 'Sit down, relax, and keep looking at the spoon,' said Dirk, 'you are already feeling sleepy…'\r\n Another police car pulled itself up to a screeching halt outside Richard's flat, and a grim-faced man climbed out and strode over to one of the constables on duty outside, flashing an identity card.\r\n 'Detective Inspector Mason, Cambridgeshire CID,' he said.  'This the MacDuff place?'\r\n The constable nodded and showed him to the side-door entrance which opened on to the long narrow staircase leading up to the top flat.\r\n Mason bustled in and then bustled straight out again.\r\n 'There's a sofa halfway up the stairs,' he told the constable.  'Get it moved.'\r\n 'Some of the lads have already tried, sir,' the constable replied anxiously.  'It seems to be stuck.  Everyone's having to climb over it for the moment, sir.  Sorry, sir.'\r\n Mason gave him another grim look from a vast repertoire he had developed which ranged from very, very blackly grim indeed at the bottom of the scale, all the way up to tiredly resigned and only faintly grim, which he reserved for his children's birthdays.\r\n 'Get it moved,' he repeated grimly, and bustled grimly back through the door grimly hauling up his trousers and coat in preparation for the grim ascent ahead.\r\n 'No sign of him yet?'  asked the driver of the car, coming over himself.  'Sergeant Gilks,' he introduced himself.  He looked tired.\r\n 'Not as far as I know,' said the constable, 'but no one tells me anything.'\r\n 'Know how you feel,' agreed Gilks.  'Once the CID gets involved you just get relegated to driving them about.  And I'm the only one who knows what he looked like.  Stopped him in the road last night.  We just came from Way's house.  Right mess.'\r\n 'Bad night, eh?'\r\n 'Varied.  Everything from murder to hauling horses out of bathrooms.\r\n No, don't even ask. "

        "text":"Only 13 percent of the 66,908 invaders who demanded asylum in Europe in March 2017 claimed to be Syrians — a statistic which completely undermines the entire asylum racket’s claim to be offering shelter to “war refugees.”\r\n\r\n According to the European Union’s official European Asylum Support Office (EASO) “Latest asylum trends–March 2017,” the 66,908 nonwhite invaders who claimed asylum in March this year “marked the first monthly increase since August 2016,” and compared to the previous month, “February 2017, the number of applications rose by 14 percent.”\r\n\r\n At least 3 percent of the applicants “claimed to be unaccompanied minors (UAMs) when lodging an application,” and the largest shares of UAM applicants were accounted for by Afghan citizens (13 percent), closely followed by Gambian citizens (11 percent).\r\n\r\n In March, the top-three claimed citizenships of origin of applicants was composed of Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, the same composition as registered between April 2016 and October 2016.\r\n\r\n Nigeria, which since November 2016 alternated between being fourth, second, and third citizenship of origin, dropped to the fourth position in March 2017.\r\n The list of the 10 most frequent citizenships of origin was completed by Pakistan, Albania, Eritrea, Guinea, Bangladesh, and Côte d’Ivoire.\r\n\r\n With the exception of Eritrean and Nigerian applicants, which each decreased by 3 percent compared to February, all top 10 citizenships recorded higher numbers of applicants.\r\n\r\n In March 2017, 8,512 invaders who said they were Syrians — a claim which is doubtful given the large number of fake and forged Syrian documents in circulation — demanded asylum in Europe.\r\n\r\n This amounted to only 13 percent of all applicants in the EU in March 2017 — and that from the country where there is indeed a war going on.  Of course, even Syrians have no real excuse to claim asylum anywhere, as more than half of their own country is under government control, and they could easily move in peace to those regions.\r\n\r\n Nonetheless, the fact that 87 percent of the nonwhite invasion force which swooped on Europe to parasite off European liberalism and welfare handouts, is not from Syria, is conclusive evidence that the entire asylum racket is a hoax.\r\n\r\n There is no “asylum crisis” — there is only an ongoing, coordinated, and determined invasion of the white First World by the nonwhite Third World.\r\n It is an invasion which, if left to proceed, will destroy Europe completely and drag it down to the level of the Third World.\r\n\r\n * Separately, the EASO announced that it had “relocated” a total of 16,477 nonwhite invaders from Greece and Turkey into other countries within the European Union since January 2016.\r\n\r\n The “relocation” program entails the EU physically transporting the invaders who have landed in Greece and Italy to the following states: Finland (1,242 “relocated”), Sweden (39), Norway (902), Latvia (290), Lithuania (251), Estonia (100), Romania (568), Bulgaria (29), Croatia (33), Slovenia (166), Switzerland (762), Liechtenstein (10), France (3.157), Spain (886), Portugal (1,251), Luxembourg (277), Belgium (522), Netherlands (1,687), Cyprus (65), Malta (111), and Ireland (382)"

        "text":"Chapter 529: The Might of the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile\r\n\r\n Roar!\r\n\r\n A low and primordial roar rang out from the bloody light, that covered the sky, as the titanic silhouette started to move.  As the bloody light faded, an enormous figure appeared before everyone’s eyes.\r\n\r\n Hiss!\r\n\r\n When the enormous figure within the bloody light was reflected in everyone’s eyes, a series of gasps echoed across the area.\r\n\r\n That figure was a hundred feet large blood colored giant crocodile.  Its entire body was covered with a bloody light.  A thick layer of blood armour was covering its gigantic body.  Its uneven surface contained some thorns that were extended outwards.  At a first glance, it was as though the thick armour was a weapon used for massacre.\r\n\r\n There was deep dark black coloured horn on the head of the large blood coloured crocodile and an unusual blood light was vaguely flowing over it.  It was as though there was a frighteningly sharpness, that could penetrate through the world suddenly spreading from it.\r\n\r\n This ancient giant crocodile that seemed to have emerged from the prehistoric era appeared within the blood light.  It overlooked everyone on the field from its high position.  Its large bloody eyes were emitting a ferocious glint.\r\n\r\n This was the soul of the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile.  By borrowing the strength from two ancient bloodlines, Lin Dong had finally summoned it from within the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear!\r\n\r\n “What… What is this thing……”\r\n\r\n The bodies of Tian Zhen and the three others had basically froze as they were completely stunned out of their minds.  Their eyes contained an incomparable amount of shock as they witnessed this scene.  The enormous being from within the blood light, had directly caused the blood within their blood vessels to show signs of solidifying.\r\n\r\n A paleness had surged onto the expressions of the four of them at this moment.  They could sense an extremely dangerous ripple from within that enormous blood figure.  That ripple was far stronger than them.\r\n\r\n “How is this possible?”  Lin Langtian inhaled a deep breath of air.  He tried his best to suppress his crazy beating heart.  Meanwhile, his face was incomparably gloomy.  Lin Dong’s move had essentially destroyed all of his plans.  Although he had yet to exchange blows with this enormous being… it was possible to tell from the ripples that were emitted, that the four of them would have difficulty defeating it even if they joined forces.\r\n\r\n Originally, he thought that he could use the Ancient Secret Key as a reason to borrow the strength the others.  With the strength of the four of them, it was sufficient to completely finish off Lin Dong in this Ancient Treasure Trove.  However, this unexpected change had undoubtedly completely wrecked his plans.\r\n\r\n “Gulp.”\r\n\r\n Standing beside him, Tian Zhen, Mo Shou and Jiang Shan also swallowed a mouthful of saliva.  They stared at the enormous being within the blood light and immediately felt their scalps turn numb.  Only at this moment did they completely understand why Lin Dong did not reveal the slightest fear, even when facing against their combined attacks.  This fellow actually had such a frightening trump card…\r\n\r\n “Is that the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile?”  Liu Bai and Yan Sen’s eyes had similarly gathered onto that enormous figure.  However, it appears that the both of them possessed quite a good eyesight.  They finally muttered those words after staring at that figure for a moment.\r\n\r\n “How is it possible that this Lin Dong has summoned an Ancient Heavenly Crocodile?  It is rumoured that such a fierce Demonic Beast could be considered as a powerful existence even in the ancient times.”  An expert behind Liu Bai uttered with a tone that contained some shock.\r\n\r\n “It is not a genuine Ancient Heavenly Crocodile.  Rather, it is a remnant Ancient Heavenly Crocodile’s soul.”  Liu Bai shook his head and replied, “If it was a real Heavenly Crocodile, there would no longer be a need for him to participate in the Hundred Empire War.  Once he summons this creature, no one would dare to fight with him.  Even those abnormal beings from the super empires would likely change their expressions once this monster appears.”\r\n\r\n “However, even if it was only the soul of the Heavenly Crocodile, it is also quite powerful… I wonder just where did this fellow obtain it from…” Mu Hong Ling curled her red lips.  Although she did not appear to lose herself like the others on the surface, the rise and fall of her voluminous chests allowed others to understand the shock in her heart.\r\n\r\n “Haha, I have already said that Lin Dong is not a simple person.  Tian Zhen and the others think that they can defeat him with numbers.  However, they did not expect that this metal plate is much harder than they imagined.  At the end, they could only hurt their own legs.”  Liu Bai laughed.\r\n\r\n Mu Hongling nodded slightly.  Her peach blossom like eyes watched the man in the field holding a blood coloured long spear.  This fellow might only be from a low rank empire, but the things that he did were those that even these experts from the high rank empire were unable to do…\r\n\r\n “Once you have recovered from your shock, you can come and try this thing…”\r\n\r\n Lin Dong gently twisted his hand in the face of the entire place inhaling a cold breath of air.  His eyes teasingly watched the pale white expression of Lin Langtian’s group.  A thought passed through his heart without him wasting any breath.  The Heavenly Crocodile soul within the blood light extended a claw that was filled with blood coloured scales and ruthlessly struck it towards Tian Zhen’s group.\r\n\r\n Swoosh!\r\n\r\n The blood coloured claw transformed into a bloody ray of light.  It appeared to have torn apart the sky.  A blood coloured scar would be formed in the air along the path which it tore through.\r\n\r\n The swiftness of the Heavenly Crocodile’s soul was unimaginable.  Even someone as strong as Tian Zhen could only see a ray of light flashing past their eyes.  Immediately, a dangerous feeling was suddenly extended as all the pores on his body stood up.\r\n\r\n Bang!\r\n\r\n Surging Yuan Power rushed out from the bodies of all four of them without additional thoughts.  They did not dare to underestimate the situation in the face of such a rich sense of danger.\r\n\r\n Bright golden light surged out from within the bodies of the four individuals when the Yuan Power splurted out.  Tian Zhen, Mu Shou and Jian Shan directly activated their strongest golden body barrier.  This solid-like golden body barrier covered the three of them.  Golden glow overflowed from it, giving it an extremely tough appearance.\r\n\r\n Lin Langtian was a one Yuan Nirvana Stage expert and he was still unable to reach the level of gathering the energy from the Nirvana Golden Body on the surface of his skin and forming a golden barrier.  However, he had also maneuvered his Yuan Power to its limit.  His entire body was bright gold in colour, appearing extremely dazzling.\r\n\r\n While the four of them were wildly maneuvering their strength, the claw from the Heavenly Crocodile’s souls suddenly smashed downwards.  After which, it mercilessly smashed onto the bright golden glow in front of the eyes of many.\r\n\r\n Clang!\r\n\r\n A clear bell like noise resounded over the field.  Soon after, countless incomparably fierce explosion occurred.\r\n\r\n Golden glow shot in all directions.  That seemingly powerful golden body barrier had only lasted for a couple of breaths in the face of the smashing blood coloured claw from the Heavenly Crocodile’s Soul.  After which, it blasted apart without any obstruction in front of the many stunned gazes and the frightened eyes of Tian Zhen’s group!  Boom boom!\r\n\r\n Golden light shot all over the place and the four figures miserable flew outwards.  Their bodies directly rubbed over the field, forming four glaring scars over it.  Finally, they managed to stabilize their bodies forcefully after it reached the area near the edge of the field.\r\n\r\n Grug!\r\n\r\n However, the force within their bodies erupted just when all of them stabilized themselves.  Four mouthful of fresh blood were spat out.  Their originally pale face had become even paler.\r\n\r\n The eyes of everyone on the field observed Tian Zhen’s group miserably spitting blood.  All of them involuntarily became silent.  Some of their faces even twitched.  Although they had already guessed this ending when the soul of the Heavenly Crocodile had appeared, they realised that they were unable to remain as calm as they had imagined when such an occurrence really appeared in front of them.\r\n\r\n That was three top experts who had the qualification to attempt the third Nirvana Tribulation!\r\n\r\n If people like Tian Zhen were given sufficient time, it was likely that they could even advance into that Nirvana Ranking and become an expert whom others looked up to.  However, they were actually forced by Lin Dong into such a miserable state despite having joined forces!\r\n\r\n The eyes of Tian Zhen’s group were filled with shock as they landed on the ground.  They raised their heads and looked at Lin Dong a shock distance away.  A faint horror was flashing in their eyes.\r\n\r\n “I will not kill all of you.  You can get lost by yourself!”  Lin Dong’s eyes were bone chillingly cold as they swept over Tian Zhen and the two others.  His tone was indifferent.\r\n\r\n “Lin Dong, I am acquainted with the people from the Great Gan Empire.  I don’t believe that you dare to touch me!”  Green and white colour interlaced over Tian Zhen’s face as he cried out with fury.\r\n\r\n “Great Gan Empire?  That is a super empire.  This Tian Zhen is actually related to them?”  Tian Zhen’s voice had just sounded out, when some exclamations sounded from the surrounding crowd.\r\n\r\n “I do not wish to repeat myself again!”\r\n\r\n Lin Dong’s eyes became chilly.  A thought passed through his heart and the Heavenly Crocodile’s souls once again extended its blood coloured claw.  In an instant, a dense killing intent spread from it.\r\n\r\n “You!”\r\n\r\n Tian Zhen’s expression finally began to change as he sense the killing intent that came spreading from within Lin Dong’s body.  He knew that if he continued to contradict Lin Dong, it was likely that the latter would really mercilessly give him a killing blow!\r\n\r\n “Lin Dong, nothing in this world remains constant.  Today, I shall admit my loss here.  I will seek recompense for this grudge in the future!”  Compared to Tian Zhen, Mu Shou and Jiang Shan were extremely straightforward and tactful.  The situation in front of them had already changed.  If they were to continue remaining in this place, it was likely that they would not be able to defeat the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile that Lin Dong had summoned even if they were to join forces.  In that case, it was best for them to directly leave!\r\n\r\n Hence, the two of them got up, threw these words to Lin Dong before turning around and jolting out of the field.\r\n\r\n “Consider yourself vicious!  You should just wait!”\r\n\r\n Tian Zhen’s expression was a little green after seeing Mo Shou and Jiang Shan leaving.  The glint in his eyes changed for a moment before he finally clenched his teeth unwillingly and charged out from the field.\r\n\r\n Everyone looked at this scene where Lin Dong’s words had chased away the three great overlords.  All of them were quietly speechless.  This Lin Dong was indeed not a person that one should easily offend…\r\n\r\n “Humph, Lin Dong, remember, it is not over between us!”\r\n\r\n At this moment, Lin Langtian also stood up with an ugly expression.  Tian Zhen and the two others were forced to leave.  There was little that he could accomplish alone.  It seemed that he could only withdraw first.\r\n\r\n However, just when he was preparing to withdraw, an icy cold smile was slowly lifted on Lin Dong’s face.  He raised his head and observed Lin Langtian.  His soft voice contained a dense killing intent as it quietly spread over this field.\r\n\r\n “They can leave but you cannot.”"

        "text":"Chapter 530 Killer Intent\r\n\r\n “They can leave but you can’t,”\r\n\r\n As Lin Dong’s voice resounded through the wide field, Lin Langtian’s retreating figure froze abruptly.  Soon after, a sinister look rushed onto his handsome face.\r\n\r\n Compared to the Tian Zhen trio, Lin Langtian was still the biggest sore in Lin Dong’s eyes.  The latter had an extreme understanding of this ‘comrade’ that came here alongside with him from the Great Yan Empire.  This fellow still possessed the mysterious Yuan Spirit in his body.  If he continued to ignored him, he would certainly achieve great accomplishments.  Furthermore, the grudges between them were equivalent to fire and ice.  As long as Lin Langtian had the opportunity, he would seize it and hit Lin Dong while he was down without any hesitation, like what had happened earlier today.\r\n\r\n Therefore, this enemy must be eliminated as soon as possible.  Otherwise, it would be much more difficult to deal with him in the future!\r\n\r\n Even though Lin Dong understood that the Tian Zhen trio was equally troublesome, he knew it would still be difficult to kill the four of them simultaneously even if he possessed the soul of the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile.  Furthermore, Lin Langtian still had the help of the mysterious Yuan Spirit in his body, Hence, Lin Dong had to leave the Lin Zhen trio to make sure that he could get rid of this problem.\r\n\r\n At this moment, on the large field, Liu Bai and Yan Sen were flabbergasted at this scene.  It appeared that Lin Dong and Lin Langtian had deep grudges between them.  Otherwise, Lin Dong would not have hold on to his killer intent towards Lin Langtian even after he let the Tian Zhen trio off.\r\n\r\n “Lin Dong, do you really think that you can make me stay just because you have this thing?”  Under numerous surprised gazes, Lin Langtian sneered and his eyes contained a tinge of ghastliness.\r\n\r\n Lin Dong dropped his gaze slightly.  Without saying anything and with a jolt of his mind, the soul of Ancient Heavenly Crocodile, which was entrenched in the corpse, gave out a heaven-shattering roar.  Its blood-colored claws started to tear through space again and blasted towards Lin Langtian with a terrifyingly violent force.\r\n\r\n “Hand of the Universal Emperor!”\r\n\r\n Upon seeing the soul of the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile struck again, Lin Langtian’s gloomy face paled.  However, without the slightest amount of hesitation, the Yuan Power in his body began to coagulate rapidly and materialized into a huge Yan Power palm.\r\n\r\n Bang!\r\n\r\n The huge Yuan Power palm landed forcefully against the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile’s claw, but it soon ruptured after withstanding the claw momentarily.  The violent shockwave knocked Lin Langtian a few hundred metres back, causing the blood and qi in his body to boil violently.\r\n\r\n “Master Mu, give me a helping hand and I will rip his body apart into tens thousand pieces today!”  Lin Langtian bellowed in his head as blood gushed through his body and fury filled his heart.\r\n\r\n “You are not his match, escape before it’s too late.  If you want to take revenge, we will talk about it again in the future!”  An indifferent voice rapidly rang across Lin Langtian’s mind.  This voice belonged to the mysterious entity that Lin Langtian called Master Mu.\r\n\r\n “I have already make an escape last time around, how can I escape again!”  Upon hearing what was said, Lin Langtian snarled in his heart.  He was an individual that was full of pride and arrogance.  However,for the past few years, Lin Dong had been surpassing him time and time again and eventually, he was been forced to escape like a stray dog.  The last escape he made was enough to make him feel extremely humiliated.  This time around, with an substantial increase in his powers, how could he escape like a stray dog again?\r\n\r\n “This Lin Dong is not as simple as you think.  Even if I help you, we cannot kill him.  If you insist on taking the offensive, I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle the consequences,” The mysterious Yuan Spirit reprimanded apathetically with regards to Lin Langtian’s snarling complaints.\r\n\r\n Creak!\r\n\r\n Lin Langtian’s eyes slightly reddened and his fists were so tightly clenched that they gave off creaking sound.  After a moment, he finally nodded his head reluctantly.  However, in his mind, the level of viciousness he had towards Lin Dong had reached an indescribable degree.\r\n\r\n Upon seeing Lin Langtian restrain the fury in his heart, the mysterious Yuan Spirit nodded its head.  Then, it continued, “I will ensure that you escape.  Even though Lin Dong is troublesome, he can’t stop me from securing your escape!”\r\n\r\n Boom!\r\n\r\n As the Yuan Spirit finished it sentence, Lin Langtian’s body suddenly jerked violently.  A weird greyish glow swept across his eyes.  All of a sudden, a powerful aura erupted from his body.\r\n\r\n As the aura expanded, Lin Langtian punched his fist out.  Frantic and immense power gathered around his fist and collided brutally against the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile’s claw.\r\n\r\n Bang!\r\n\r\n Visible air ripples swept through the air.  However, this time around, Lin Langtian was not severely injured as expected.  His body staggered backward and took on the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile’s claw by force.\r\n\r\n Immediately, this scene created an uproar among the onlookers in the field.  A surprise look even swept across Liu Bai and Yen Sen’s eyes.  The strength of the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile was comparable to a Three Yuan Nirvana stage practitioner.  Even if they combined forces, it would take all of their efforts to be able to withstand it.  It was not expected that an One Yuan Nirvana stage practitioner like Lin Langtian could withstood such attack.\r\n\r\n “It’s rumored that Lin Langtian and Lin Dong are both from the Great Yan Empire and the relationship between both of them is like fire and water…” Mu Hongling said softly as she gazed at the two persons in the sky with great attention.\r\n\r\n “Oh?  This Great Yan Empire seems to be a place that is filled with luck and treasures.  It’s really surprising to see two extraordinary individuals like them to appear in such a low-ranked empire,” Liu Bai was startled.  Apparently, he was rather startled at this fact.\r\n\r\n Mu Honglin nodded her head slightly.  Given Lin Langtian’s sudden outburst of such terrifying power, even if he was to be compared with some high-ranked empires, he would still be considered formidable, let alone an even more outstanding individual like Lin Dong.\r\n\r\n “Finally taking the offensive huh?”\r\n\r\n Just as the onlookers-filled site was astonished at Lin Langtian’s sudden outburst of aura, Lin Dong’s gaze suddenly froze.  Other people might not know what was going on with Lin Langtian, but he clearly understood that the mysterious Yuan Spirit was responsible for this.  Boundless Yuan Power, like gushing floodwater, were engulfing Lin Langtian’s body.  The greyish glow that was coagulating in his eyes made him come off as extremely cold and weird.\r\n\r\n “Lin Dong, I want to see how are you going to kill me!”  Lin Langtian sneered as he curled the corner of his mouth and stared at Lin Dong sinisterly.\r\n\r\n With the assistance of the mysterious Yuan Spirit in his body, he had reached a level that was comparable to a Three Yuan Nirvana stage practitioner for the time being.  With regards to such level of power, even if Lin Dong possessed the soul of Ancient Heavenly Crocodile, he absolutely could not kill Lin Langtian.\r\n\r\n Lin Dong squinted his eyes.  He had no choice but to admit that Lin Langtian’s powers did increase a lot with the help from the mysterious Yuan Spirit…. .\r\n\r\n “Lin Dong, do you need my help?”  Little Marten’s voice suddenly rang across Lin Dong’s mind as he squinted both his eyes.\r\n\r\n “No need, I can handle this.”\r\n\r\n Lin Dong shook his head slightly and rejected Little Marten’s offer.  Right now, Little Marten just obtained the Samsara pill and it was best not to reveal it now.  After all, once Little Marten recovered its physical body, its powers would advance by leaps and bounds.  It would be a world of difference for its power between then and now.  Therefore, because of the importance of this matter, Lin Dong did not want anything to happen to Little Marten now.\r\n\r\n “No matter what help you have borrowed, I want your life today!”\r\n\r\n With an indifferent expression, Lin Dong reached out his palm abruptly.  Immediately, the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile soul that was in the mid-air, roared towards the sky.  Powerful,sharp and piercing claw winds swept down from the sky and blasted towards Lin Langtian.\r\n\r\n Bang bang bang!\r\n\r\n Facing the relentless and brutal attacks from the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile soul, Lin Langtian quickly activated his Yuan Power and with the help from the mysterious Yuan Spirit in his body, he was actually able to withstand the savage attacks.\r\n\r\n The surrounding onlookers were shocked upon seeing Lin Langtian who seemed to receive some kinds of god-given help.  Previously, Lin Langtian could not even withstand one swipe from the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile’s claws, yet now he could go head-to-head with the incoming attacks.  This turn of events seemed to be too abrupt.\r\n\r\n “Haha, I have already said that you can’t kill me.  However, Lin Dong, don’t be too pleased with yourself.  This time around, count yourself lucky.  The next time we meet, I will not give you any opportunity to make a comeback!”\r\n\r\n After exchange one more round of blows with the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile soul, Lin Langtian cackled towards the sky and started to retreated quickly.\r\n\r\n “This time around, I will not give you the chance to make a comeback!”  Lin Dong’s eyes were piercing cold.  With a jolt of his body, he flew violently towards Lin Langtian.\r\n\r\n “You are courting death!”\r\n\r\n When he saw that Lin Dong actually dared to take the initiative and rushed towards him, a glint of sinister look flashed across Lin Langtian’s eyes.  Right now, with the help of his mysterious Yuan Spirit, Lin Langtian’s powers had already reached the level that was equivalent to a Three Yuan Nirvana stage practitioner.  If they were to fight head-to-head, Lin Dong would not be his match.\r\n\r\n “Faster escape now, this lad is not as simple as you think!”\r\n\r\n However, the mysterious Yuan Spirit’s voice rang across Lin Langtian’s mind just as his eyes were twinkling with killing intent.\r\n\r\n “Master Mu, you have overestimated this lad.  Given my current situation, how can he handle me?  Furthermore, if I kill him now, the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile soul will be destroyed.  When that moment comes, we may even have the chance of obtaining the four great mysterious sects’ inheritances!”  Lin Langtian replied eerily as his eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n “How can I give up such a rare opportunity!”\r\n\r\n Upon hearing Lin Langtian’s words, the mysterious Yuan Spirit seemed to be stunned momentarily.  There appeared to be some some hesitation.  If Lin Dong was just controlling the Ancient Heavenly Crocodile soul by one side, there was nothing much they could do about the situation.  However, if he was rushing them head-on like this, it was still undecided who might emerge as the victor.\r\n\r\n Swoosh!\r\n\r\n Its hesitation lasted only for a short while because Lin Dong was already right in front of Lin Langtian.  Upon seeing this, a ghastly look flashed across the latter’s face.  With the Yuan Power surging frantically in his body, he punched his fist out ruthlessly!\r\n\r\n “Since you wish to die, I shall grant your wish!”\r\n\r\n Frantic and matchless Yuan Power swept out from Lin Langtian’s fist like a hurricane.  Such power sufficed to make a Two Yuan Nirvana stage practitioner overwhelmed with shock.\r\n\r\n However, in the face of such powerful attack, the incoming Lin Dong did not show any fear in his eyes as what Lin Langtian expected him to be.  Instead, there was an ice-cold, smirking look in the former’s eyes.\r\n\r\n “Tcch!”\r\n\r\n Just as Lin Langtian was feeling uneasy about the smirking look in Lin Dong’s eyes, he suddenly saw a black-colored,weird flame spiralled out from Lin Dong’s palm.\r\n\r\n At the moment when Lin Langtian saw the black-colored flame, his limbs went ice-cold instantly."

        "text":"Despite the refusal of the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass, to release any DNA results which might indicate the racial ancestry of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, the leaked results reveal that King Tut’s DNA is a 99.6 percent match with Western European Y chromosomes.\r\n\r\n The DNA test results were inadvertently revealed on a Discovery Channel TV documentary filmed with Hawass’s permission  —  but it seems as if the Egyptian failed to spot the giveaway part of the documentary which revealed the test results.\r\n\r\n Hawass previously announced that he would not release the racial DNA results of Egyptian mummies  —  obviously because he feared the consequences of such a revelation.\r\n\r\n On the Discovery Channel broadcast, which can be seen on the Discovery Channel website here, or if they pull it, on YouTube here, at approximately 1:53 into the video, the camera pans over a printout of DNA test results from King Tut.\r\n\r\n Firstly, here is a brief explanation of the results visible in the video.  It is a list of what is called Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).\r\n\r\n STRs are repeated DNA sequences which are “short repeat units” whose characteristics make them especially suitable for human identification.\r\n\r\n These STR values for 17 markers visible in the video are as follows:\r\nDYS 19 – 14 (?  not clear)\r\n DYS 385a – 11\r\n DYS 385b – 14\r\n DYS 389i – 13\r\n DYS 389ii – 30\r\n DYS 390 – 24\r\n DYS 391 – 11\r\n DYS 392 – 13\r\n DYS 393 – 13\r\n DYS 437 – 14 (?  not clear)\r\n DYS 438 – 12\r\n DYS 439 – 10\r\n DYS 448 – 19\r\n DYS 456 – 15\r\n DYS 458 – 16\r\n DYS 635 – 23\r\n YGATAH4 – 11\r\n\r\n What does this mean?  Fortunately, a genius by the name of Whit Athey provides the key to this list.  Mr Athey is a retired physicist whose working career was primarily at the Food and Drug Administration where he was chief of one of the medical device labs.\r\n\r\n Mr Athey received his doctorate in physics and biochemistry at Tufts University, and undergraduate (engineering) and masters (math) degrees at Auburn University.  For several years during the 1980s, he also taught one course each semester in the electrical engineering department of the University of Maryland.  Besides his interest in genetic genealogy, he is an amateur astronomer and has his own small observatory near his home in Brookeville, MD.\r\n\r\n He also runs a very valuable website called the “Haplogroup Predictor” which allows users to input STR data and generate the haplogroup which marks those STR data.\r\n\r\n For those who want to know what a haplogroup is, here is a “simple” definition: a haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation.\r\n\r\n Still none the wiser?  Damn these scientists.\r\n\r\n Ok, let’s try it this way: a haplotype is a combination of multiple specific locations of a gene or DNA sequence on a chromosome.\r\n\r\n Haplogroups are assigned letters of the alphabet, and refinements consist of additional number and letter combinations, for example R1b or R1b1.  Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups have different haplogroup designations.  In essence, haplogroups give an inisight into ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.\r\n\r\n By entering all the STR data inadvertently shown on the Discovery video, a 99.6 percent fit with the R1b haplogroup is revealed.\r\n\r\n"

Few people knew him that well.  His mother, perhaps, but there existed between them a state of cold war and neither had spoken to the other now in weeks.\r\n He also had an elder brother, Peter, who was now tremendously senior in the Marines.  Apart from at their father's funeral, Michael had not seen Peter since he came back from the Falklands, covered in glory, promotion, and contempt for his younger brother.\r\n Peter had been delighted that their mother had taken over Magna, and had sent Michael a regimental Christmas card to that effect.  His own greatest satisfaction still remained that of throwing himself into a muddy ditch and firing a machine gun for at least a minute, and he didn't think that the British newspaper and publishing industry, even in its current state of unrest, was likely to afford him that pleasure, at least until some more Australians moved into it.\r\n Michael had risen very late after a night of cold savagery and then of troubled dreams which still disturbed him now in the late morning daylight.\r\n His dreams had been filled with the familiar sensations of loss, isolation, guilt and so forth, but had also been inexplicably involved with large quantities of mud.  By the telescopic power of the night, the nightmare of mud and loneliness had seemed to stretch on for terrifying, unimaginable lengths of time, and had only concluded with the appearance of slimy things with legs that had crawled on the slimy sea.  This had been altogether too much and he had woken with a start in a cold sweat.\r\n Though all the business with the mud had seemed strange to him, the sense of loss, of isolation, and above all the aggrievement, the need to undo what had been done, these had all found an easy home in his spirit.\r\n Even the slimy things with legs seemed oddly familiar and ticked away irritably at the back of his mind while he made himself a late breakfast, a piece of grapefruit and some China tea, allowed his eyes to rest lightly on the arts pages of the /Daily Telegraph/ for a while, and then rather clumsily changed the dressing on the cuts on his hand.\r\n These small tasks accomplished, he was then in two minds as to what to do next.\r\n He was able to view the events of the previous night with a cool detachment that he would not have expected.  It had been right, it had been proper, it had been correctly done.  But it resolved nothing.  All that mattered was yet to be done.\r\n All what?  He frowned at the odd way his thoughts ebbed and flowed.\r\n Normally he would pop along to his club at about this time.  It used to be that he would do this with a luxurious sense of the fact that there were many other things that he should be doing.  Now there was nothing else to do, which made time spent there, as anywhere else, hang somewhat heavy on his hands.\r\n"

These results indicate\r\n that high-frequency alpha rhythms over associative, premotor and non-dominant primary\r\n sensorimotor areas subserve motor control and are predictive of the golfer’s performance.\r\n (Received 27 July 2007;  accepted after revision 10 October 2007;  first published online 18 October 2007)\r\n Corresponding author C.

Email: claudio.delpercio@uniroma1.it\r\n A large body of evidence indicates that electroencephalographic\r\n (EEG) alpha (about 8–12 Hz) and beta\r\n (about 14–30 Hz) oscillations markedly decrease in power\r\n over sensorimotor cortical areas during the preparation\r\n and execution of voluntary self-paced movements;  this\r\n reduction is known as event-related desynchronization\r\n (ERD;  Gastaut, 1952;  Babiloni et al. 1999;  Pfurtscheller\r\n & Lopes da Silva, 1999;  Pfurtscheller et al. 2000;\r\n Neuper & Pfurtscheller, 2001).  These sensorimotor EEG\r\n oscillations are collectively called ‘mu rhythm’ and can\r\n be distinguished from other alpha or beta rhythms\r\n (e.g.  parieto-occipital alpha) that show changes in\r\n amplitude during sensory information processing\r\n (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999).  Furthermore,\r\nalpha and beta ERD are generally related to fine\r\n This paper has online supplemental material.\r\n cognitive-motor performance (Klimesch et al. 1997;\r\n Klimesch, 1999;  Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999).\r\n These rhythms mainly reflect the mode of transfer and\r\n processing of sensorimotor information among cortical\r\n and thalamic structures (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva,\r\n1999).\r\n Among EEG rhythms, alpha rhythms seem to be\r\n especially implicated in the sporting performance of\r\n athletes.  Marked differences in alpha power have been\r\n observed between expert sportsmen and non-athletes\r\n (Hatfield et al. 1984;  Collins et al. 1990;  Salazar et al.\r\n 1990;  Crews & Landers, 1993;  Shaw, 1993, 1996;  Loze et al.\r\n 2001;  Gualberto Cremades, 2002;  Del Percio et al. 2007a).\r\n Alpha power (8–12 Hz) over the occipital cortex has been\r\n found to increase before best shots in expert air pistol\r\n marksmen;  this is thought to be a sign of cortical inhibition\r\n in the period of stillness that occurs at certain phases\r\n of a skilled motor act (Loze et al. 2001).  Furthermore,\r\nC 2008 The Authors.  Journal compilation C 2008 The Physiological Society DOI: 10.1113/jphysiol.2007.141630\r\n 132 C. Babiloni and others J Physiol 586.1\r\n alpha power has been found to be higher over the left\r\n than the right hemisphere of skilled marksmen during\r\n shot preparation (Hatfield et al. 1984), and before the best\r\n shots of elite archers (Salazar ´ et al. 1990;  Landers et al.\r\n 1994;  Shaw, 1996).  This hemispherical asymmetry of alpha\r\n rhythms has been challenged by other evidence showing\r\n that sporting performance is associated with bilateral or\r\n preponderant modulation of alpha rhythms over the right\r\n hemisphere (Collins et al. 1990;  Crews & Landers, 1993;\r\n Del Percio et al. 2007a).  A possible cause of these contrasting\r\n results is the use of standard EEG techniques with\r\n poor spatial resolution.\r\n In this high-resolution EEG study, we evaluated whether\r\n frontal alpha and beta rhythms of the two hemispheres\r\n are implicated in fine motor control and balance, by\r\n simultaneously examining EEG and stabilometric data\r\n obtained in right-handed expert golfers during putts.\r\n Methods\r\n Subjects and ethical approval\r\n Seven men and five women expert golfers were recruited.\r\n They had been practising golf for more than 8 years\r\n and at least five times a week, and regularly compete in\r\n national and international competitions.  Their mean age\r\n was 20.8 ± 1 years (range: 16–25 years).  All golfers were\r\n right-handed as measured by the Edinburgh Inventory\r\n (mean 56.3 ± 6.2%).  All subjects gave their informed\r\n consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and were\r\n free to withdraw from the study at any time.  The procedure\r\n was approved by the local Institutional Ethics Committee\r\n (I Medical School, University of Rome ‘Sapienza’).\r\n Experimental procedure and recordings\r\n All subjects were asked to stand upright upon a 60 × 60 cm\r\n stabilometric force platform (ARGO by RGM Genova,\r\nItaly) at a golf green simulator (1.5 m × 3 m;  see online\r\n supplemental material, Supplemental Fig. 1).  The surface\r\n of the green simulator was covered with a special green\r\n moquette (kindly provided by the Italian Federation of\r\n Golf for the purpose of the study).  In the golf green\r\n simulator, the distance between the starting point of the\r\n ball and the hole was 2.1 m.  Hole diameters were 108 mm\r\n (standard), 80 mm or 60 mm.  For each subject, the hole\r\n diameter associated with more than 30% unsuccessful\r\n putts was used, as ascertained during a preliminary\r\n training phase in which subjects familiarized themselves\r\n with the golf green simulator.  The training phase\r\n always started with the 108 mm-diameter hole (standard)\r\n and consisted of about 50 putts within about 15 min.\r\n Subjects then performed about 100 putts (interstroke\r\n interval of 15 s) in 10 separate recording blocks\r\n (interblocks interval of about 90 s).  The golf putting\r\n performance was self-paced, in that the subjects were asked\r\n to relax between two consecutive putts and to start the golf\r\n putting performance when they felt ready.  A device based\r\n on optic technologies was used to define the time of impact\r\n between the putter and ball.\r\n The stabilometric force platform recorded the\r\n amplitude of the subject’s body sway in the anteroposterior\r\n and mediolateral directions, with an acquisition rate of\r\n 100 Hz.  While the subjects stood on the stabilogram,\r\nthe EEG data were continuously recorded (bandpass:\r\n0.01–100 Hz, sampling rate: 256 Hz;  EB-Neuro Be-plus,\r\nFirenze, Italy) from 56 scalp electrodes (cap) positioned\r\n over the whole scalp according to an augmented 10–20\r\n system (see Supplemental Fig. 2).  Electrical reference was\r\n located between the Afz and Fz electrodes, and the ground\r\n electrode was located between the Pz and Oz electrodes.\r\n Electrode impedance was kept below 5 kOhm.  In parallel,\r\nthe recording of bipolar electro-oculographic data (EOG;\r\n bandpass: 0.1–100 Hz;  sampling rate: 256 Hz) monitored\r\n blinking and eye movements.  Furthermore, electromyographic\r\n data (EMG;  bandpass: 0–100 Hz;  sampling\r\n rate: 256 Hz) from the right anterior tibialis muscle, right\r\n gastrocnemius lateralis muscle and right external oblique\r\n muscle were collected to monitor muscle activity involved\r\n in upright standing.\r\n Analysis of stabilometric data\r\n The data recorded from the stabilometric force platform\r\n allowed the computation of ‘sway area’ index, which was\r\n expressed in mm2 s\r\n −1.  The sway area measured the mean\r\n area spanned by the body centre of pressure (COP) during\r\n the period of interest for each golf putt (i.e. 10 s, from\r\n −5 s to +5 s, the zero time being the instant of the impact\r\n between the putter and ball).  The sway area was calculated\r\n as the area swept by the line connecting the mean COP\r\n position with each point of the COP described path, and\r\n the recording time.\r\n Spectral analysis and computation of alpha\r\n event-related desynchronization/event-related\r\n synchronization (ERD/ERS) percentages\r\n Recorded EEG, EOG and EMG data were segmented in\r\n single trials of 10 s, each spanning −5 s to + 5 s.  The EEG\r\n epochs with ocular, muscular and other types of artifact\r\n were preliminarily identified by a computerized automatic\r\n procedure (Moretti et al. 2003).  The software package\r\n included procedures for (i) EOG artifact detection and\r\n correction;  (ii) EMG analysis;  (iii) EEG artifact analysis;\r\n and (iv) optimization of the ratio between artifact-free\r\n EEG channels and EEG single trials to be rejected.\r\n The EEG epochs contaminated by ocular artifacts were\r\n then corrected by an autoregressive method (Moretti\r\n et al. 2003).  Finally, two expert electroencephalographists\r\n (C.D.P. and N.M.) manually confirmed this automatic\r\n C 2008 The Authors.  Journal compilation C 2008 The Physiological Society\r\n J Physiol 586.1 Brain rhythms and successful golf putts 133\r\n selection and correction, with special attention to residual\r\n contaminations of the EEG epochs due to eye movements,\r\nblinking and head movements during the putts.  Indeed,\r\neye–head movements (e.g.  gaze movements between the\r\n ball and the target hole) could be critical in the baseline\r\n period, before the golfer concentrates on the stroke.\r\n Therefore, only the EEG epochs totally free from artifact\r\n residuals were accepted for the subsequent analyses.\r\n The artifact-free EEG trials were spatially enhanced\r\n by surface Laplacian estimation (regularized 3-D spline\r\n function;  Babiloni et al. 1996, 1998).  The singletrial\r\n analysis was carefully repeated on the Laplaciantransformed\r\n EEG data, to discard computational artifacts.\r\n These artifact-free Laplacian-transformed EEG trials were\r\n subdivided into two groups: the Successes group refers\r\n to EEG trials associated with the successful putts and the\r\n Failures group refers to EEG trials associated with the\r\n unsuccessful putts.  Error in the unsuccessful golf putt was\r\n defined as the final distance (cm) between the golf ball\r\n and hole.  The mean number of EEG trials was 42.9 ± 4.6\r\n (s.e.m.) for the Successes group, while it was 26.6 ± 2.6\r\n (s.e.m.) for the Failures group.  Of note, the number of the\r\n EEG trials for each condition was used as a covariate in the\r\n statistical analysis.\r\n Laplacian-transformed EEG trials were used as an\r\n input for power spectrum analysis, which was performed\r\n with a standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm\r\n using the Welch technique and Hanning windowing\r\n function (Matlab;  MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts\r\n USA).  Negative values of event-related percentage changes\r\n in alpha band power represented the ERD (Pfurtscheller &\r\n Lopes da Silva, 1999;  Pfurtschelleret al. 1997).  Conversely,\r\npositive values indicated the event-related synchronization\r\n (ERS;  Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999).  Specifically,\r\nthe alpha and beta ERD/ERS was calculated using the\r\n well-known standard formula (Pfurtscheller & Aranibar,\r\n1979;  Pfurtscheller & Neuper, 1994;  Pfurtscheller et al.\r\n 1997;  Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999):\r\nERD/ERS (%) = (E − R)\r\n R\r\n × 100\r\n where E indicates the alpha or beta power density during\r\n the event period and R indicates the alpha/beta power\r\n density during the baseline period.  In the present study,\r\nthe ‘event’ period was the movement period (from 1 s\r\n before to the impact between putter and ball as a zero\r\n time), whereas the baseline period was defined as the time\r\n interval between −5 s and −4 s.  We separately computed\r\n the ERD/ERS for the Successes and Failures conditions in\r\n the range 6–30 Hz.  For the determination of the alpha and\r\n beta sub-bands, we preliminarily defined the alpha and\r\n beta reactive frequencies (Pfurtscheller et al. 2001, 2006).\r\n In each subject, the alpha (or beta) reactive frequency\r\n indicated the frequency bin showing the highest ERD\r\n within 8–12 (or 14–30) Hz.  Based on the alpha and beta\r\n reactive frequencies, two alpha and beta sub-bands of\r\n interest were considered: the low-frequency alpha and\r\n beta bands ranged from the reactive frequency minus\r\n 2 Hz to the reactive frequency, and the high-frequency\r\n alpha and beta bands ranged from the reactive frequency\r\n to the reactive frequency plus 2 Hz.  For an individual\r\n alpha (or beta) reactive frequency of 10 (or 20) Hz, the\r\n low-frequency alpha (or beta) band is 8–10 (or 18–20) Hz,\r\nand the high-frequency alpha (or beta) band is 10–12 (or\r\n 20–22) Hz.\r\n Topographic mapping of the alpha and beta ERD/ERS\r\n percentage\r\n Topographic maps (256 hues) of the ERD/ERS at the two\r\n alpha and beta sub-bands were calculated on a 3-D cortical\r\n model using a spline interpolating function (Babiloniet al.\r\n 1996).  This model is based on the magnetic resonance\r\n data of 152 subjects digitized at the Brain Imaging\r\n Center of the Montreal Neurological Institute (SPM96,\r\nwww.mni.mcgill.ca),  and is commonly considered an\r\n acceptable template for the rendering of group neuroimaging\r\n data.\r\n Statistical analysis\r\n Statistical comparisons for the EEG and stabilometric\r\n data were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).\r\n With the ANOVA, Mauchley’s test evaluated the sphericity\r\n assumption when necessary.  Correction of the degrees\r\n of freedom was made with the Greenhouse–Geisser\r\n procedure, and Duncan’s test was used for post hoc\r\n comparisons (P < 0.05).  Four ANOVAs (one for each\r\n alpha and beta sub-band) tested the hypothesis that,\r\ncompared to the Failures condition, the Successes\r\n condition shows stronger alpha and beta ERD, indicating\r\n a stronger cortical sensorimotor activity associated\r\n with the successful putts.  The ANOVAs had ERD/ERS\r\n amplitude for a certain sub-band as a dependent variable,\r\nand the factors were condition (Successes, Failures)\r\n and electrode (Fz, FCz, C3, Cz, C4).  The number\r\n of Laplacian-transformed EEG trials was used as a\r\n covariate.  We selected Fz, FCz, C3, Cz and C4 electrodes\r\n for this analysis, as these electrodes roughly overlie\r\n primary sensorimotor areas (C3 and C4 electrodes), the\r\n supplementary motor area and motor cingulate (Cz and\r\n FCz), and the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate\r\n areas (Fz), which are thought to be related to the control\r\n of fine motor sequences (Ashe et al. 2006).\r\n An additional ANOVA tested the hypothesis that,\r\ncompared to the Failures condition, the Successes\r\n condition shows a reduced sway area of the stabilometric\r\n data, indicating a better upright balance associated with\r\n the successful rather than unsuccessful putts.  Specifically,\r\nthe ANOVA used the sway areas as a dependent variable,\r\nwith Successes or Failures as the factor.\r\n C 2008 The Authors.

Then they tried to hold him down.  Dad tossed them off and went on raging like a dangerous animal.\r\n\r\n Somewhere in the compound a husband and wife began quarrelling.  After a while a door opened and oneofthecreditorscameouttimidly,carryingthecentretable.With his head hung low, he crept to our room and Dad’s voice raged over him in utter scorn.  The creditor dropped the centre table outside our door and was creepingback to his room when Dad blocked his way and said:\r\n\r\n‘Is that where you found it, eh, you thief!’\r\n\r\n ‘I’m not a thief.  You owe me money.’\r\n\r\n ‘Is that where you found it?’\r\n\r\n The creditor turned back and picked up the table.  I was about to open the door for him but Dad shouted:\r\n\r\n‘Don’t open the door for that COWARD!’\r\n\r\n So the creditor dropped the table, opened the door, went in with the table, and came out again.\r\n\r\n ‘What about my money?’  he asked in a low voice, as he passed Dad.\r\n\r\n There was a brief silence.  Then Dad threw his money on the floor.\r\n\r\n ‘There’s your money, coward.’\r\n\r\n The creditor looked from the money on the floor to Dad who towered over him.  Then he bent down and picked up the money.\r\n\r\n ‘Money will kill you,’ Dad said.  ‘You drank of my beer, ate of my food, and because of a small amount of money you behave like a rat?’\r\n\r\n The creditor scurried off to his room and locked his door.  The noise of him quarrelling with his wife continued.  After some time their lights went out.\r\n\r\n Dad stood sheepishly in the middle of the passage, a little diminished for lack of confrontation.  He was returning to our room when the other creditor came creeping out with the pair of boots.\r\n\r\n ‘Youtoo! ’Dadcried,resuminghischargedstate. ‘Soyoustolemy boots!’\r\n\r\n The third creditor ran to our room, dropped the boots, and came out.  Dad stood in front of him, feet solidly planted.  There was silence.  The cocks crowed.  Then Dad threw his money on the floor, and the third creditor picked it up without any fuss and hurried back to his room and locked his door.\r\n\r\n Dad stood,feetplantedsolidly onthefloor,waitingforfurtherprovocation.Hehad started moving when a woman from the room of the third creditor said:\r\n\r\n‘If you’re so powerful, why don’t you join the army!’\r\n\r\n ‘If I jointhearmy,’saidDad,whirlinground,‘yourhusbandwillbethefirstperson I will shoot.’\r\n\r\n I trembled.\r\n\r\n No one else ventured to say anything.  Dad waited for someone to speak.  The wind swept harder through the passage.  The mosquitoes fell on him.  The silence deepened and the darkness became indistinguishable from the different rooms.  A child started crying.  Someone smacked it and it cried even louder.  Other babies woke and cried and then one by one the crying ceased and the compound fell asleep.  Dad came back in.\r\n\r\n He sat on his chair.  His boots stood in their proper place except that the third creditor had mischievously displayed his socks so that the holes were visible.  The centre table was slightly out of place and I put it in its proper position.  Dad rested his feet on the table.  Then he lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n Mum had been sitting on the bed, her face stony, her eyes deep, her hands on her head as though shewerewitnessingthebeginnings of atragedy.\r\n\r\n Dad’s feet stank and I noticed that his oneshoewas fallingapart.\r\n\r\n ‘No food?’  he asked, in a gentle voice.\r\n\r\n Mum passed his food.  Dad washed his hands, beckoned us to join him, and ate.  I didn’t feel hungry any more and neither did Mum.  Dad ate alone.  He had a wonderful appetite and when he finished there were only cracked bones left on the plates.  Then my hunger returned and I regretted not eating with him.\r\n\r\n Mum cleared the plates.  I cleared the table and spread out my mat.  Dad lit another cigarette and a mosquito coil and sat still.  He went on smoking and it was only when I was falling asleep that I noticed one of the chair’s feet was broken.  Dad slept on the three-legged chair and I watched his jaw lower and his face relax.  He was awoken by his sudden fall.  I showed no sign of having noticed.  He got up, grumbling.  He blew out the candle and climbed into bed beside Mum.\r\n\r\n The next morning no one spoke to us in the compound.  Dad went off to work early and suffered nothing of the whisperings that followed us everywhere or the silence that greeted us when we went to the backyard.  Mum bore it all very well.  She said her greetings to people when she passed them and her face remained impassive when they didn’t reply.  She bore it all as if she were used to that treatment all her life.  It was harder on me though.  The children stared at me with sour faces and made it clear they didn’t want my company.  The compound people became united in their dislike of us.\r\n\r\n Wewereeatingsomepap andbreadintheroomwhenMumsaid:\r\n\r\n‘From today I will start at the market.  One woman allowed me to rent her stall.  I will not go hawking very much any more.’\r\n\r\n I was pleased at the news.  Mum fondled my hair.\r\n\r\n ‘Now, go to school and afterwards stay at Madame Koto’s place till I come for you, eh?’\r\n\r\n ‘Yes, Mother.’\r\n\r\n ‘I will be locking the door and taking the key so that no one will be able to do anythingstrangeto us when weareaway.’\r\n\r\n I nodded.  But as we prepared to leave the room there was a knock on our door.  Mumopened it and found thelandlord standingoutside.\r\n\r\n ‘Tell your husband’, he said, without the slightest formality, ‘that if he repeats what he did last night I will throw him out.  I don’t care if he is called Black Cricket.  I myself am a lion.  If necessary I will send my boys to beat him up.  If he gives me any more trouble, if he borrows money from anybody in this compound again, if he threatens to burn down my house, he better go and find himself another landlord, you hear?’\r\n\r\n Mum didn’t say anything.  Her face was stony.  The landlord went down the passage and we saw him go into the room of the second creditor.  He emerged shortly afterwards with two of the creditors.  The landlord, surrounded by the women and children of the compound, relieved himself of a lengthy speech about the difficulty of building houses, about tenants more terrible than Dad that he had destroyed, and about how powerful he was.\r\n\r\n ‘If anybody gives me any trouble,’ he said, waving a fetish around, ‘I will show them that trouble is my secret name.  Tyger or no Tyger, this is my compound.  I did not steal the money to build it!’\r\n\r\n And then he bustled out of the compound, with the women and children trailing behind him.\r\n\r\n Mum waited in the room for some time before she hurried out, with her tray of provisions on her head.  I went out with her.  She locked the door and without waiting to escort me to the junction, she shot off in the opposite direction to the one the landlord had taken.  She did not call out her wares and I watched her as she disappeared from view.\r\n\r\n"

There was\r\n no significant interconditions difference in the alpha and\r\n beta reactive frequencies as evaluated by an ANOVA for\r\n each band (P > 0.3).  These results indicated the ‘reactive\r\n frequencies’ for the subsequent topographical analysis\r\n of the ERD at low- and high-frequency alpha and beta\r\n rhythms.\r\n Figure 2 maps topographical details of low- and\r\n high-frequency alpha and beta ERD/ERS percentages for\r\n the Successes and Failures conditions.  The corresponding\r\n difference maps (Successes minus Failures) are also\r\n reported.

Compared to the Failures,\r\nC 2008 The Authors.

The low- and\r\n high-frequency beta ERD showed smaller differences\r\n between the Successes and Failures conditions.  These\r\n findings indicated the prominent sensorimotor alpha ERD\r\n during the successful putts.\r\n The ANOVA for the high-frequency alpha ERD/ERS\r\n percentages pointed to a statistically significant interaction\r\n (F4,44 = 4.33;  P < 0.005) between the condition\r\n (Successes, Failures) and the electrode (Fz, FCz, C3,\r\nCz, C4).  Duncan post hoc testing indicated that the\r\n high-frequency alpha ERD was higher in amplitude in\r\n the Successes than in the Failures condition at the Fz\r\n (P = 0.01), Cz (P = 0.05) and C4 (P = 0.004) electrodes,\r\ngiving statistical support to the prominent sensorimotor\r\n alpha ERD during the successful putts (see Fig. 3).\r\n The ANOVAs for the low-frequency alpha and for\r\n the low- and high-frequency beta ERD/ERS percentages\r\n showed no statistically significant differences (P > 0.1),\r\nand were not further considered.\r\n Control analyses\r\n As illustrated before, the high-frequency alpha ERD was\r\n higher in amplitude in the Successes than in the Failures\r\n condition at the Fz, Cz and C4 electrodes (P < 0.05–0.004).\r\n A first control analysis was performed to evaluate whether\r\n the present statistical results were associated with a\r\n difference in the baseline high-frequency alpha absolute\r\n power.  To this end, the baseline high-frequency alpha\r\n absolute power was used as a dependent variable for an\r\n ANOVA design which used condition (Successes, Failures)\r\n and electrode (Fz, FCz, C3, Cz, C4) as factors, and the\r\n number of the Laplacian-transformed EEG trials as a\r\n covariate.  The results showed no statistically significant\r\n effect (P > 0.15).  It can be concluded that the above alpha\r\n Figure 3.

To this aim,\r\nLaplacian EEG time series were bandpassed (Bartlett\r\n function), squared, averaged across 120 ms periods (to\r\n 8 samples s−1), and averaged across all EEG single trials\r\n (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999).  Figure 4 shows\r\n the group grand average waveforms of the high-frequency\r\n alpha ERD/ERS percentages for the Successes and Failures\r\n conditions at Fz, FCz, Cz, C3 and C4 electrode sites.\r\n The latencies of the alpha ERD peaks were similar in\r\n the two conditions, whereas the peak amplitude was\r\n higher in the Successes than the Failures condition.  The\r\n latency of the alpha ERD peak in the single subjects\r\n was used as a dependent variable for an ANOVA design\r\n which used condition (Successes, Failures) as a factor.\r\n The ANOVA results showed no statistically significant\r\n effect (P > 0.8).  It was concluded that the peak latency\r\n of the high-frequency alpha ERD was similar during the\r\n successful and unsuccessful putts.\r\n If the alpha ERD is related to a good performance,\r\nthen it should be higher in amplitude in the unsuccessful\r\n putts in which the ball is close to the hole.  To evaluate\r\n this control hypothesis, the high-frequency alpha ERD in\r\n the Failures condition was correlated with the error (cm)\r\n from the hole (Pearson test, P < 0.05).  Results showed\r\n that the high-frequency alpha ERD at Fz was positively\r\n correlated with the error (r = 0.89, P = 0.0001, n = 12,\r\nFig. 5 top).  The same was true for the high-frequency alpha\r\n ERD/ERS percentages at the C4 and Cz electrodes (Cz:\r\nr = 0.62, P = 0.03, n = 12;  C4: r = 0.62, P = 0.03, n = 12;\r\n Fig. 5 central and bottom).  These findings indicate that,\r\nin the unsuccessful putts, the stronger the alpha ERD, the\r\n lower the error from the hole.\r\n Figure 4.

Scatterplots showing the linear correlation (Pearson\r\n test, P < 0.05) between the high-frequency alpha ERD at Fz, Cz\r\n and C4 electrodes and the error from the hole (cm) during the\r\n unsuccessful putts\r\n The stronger was the high-frequency alpha ERD, the lower was the\r\n error from the hole.

We report that the body sway area is\r\n similar in the successful and unsuccessful putts, indicating\r\n that visual–vestibular integration on the basis of eyes-open\r\n upright balance is not essential for successful performance\r\n in the current experimental conditions, characterized by\r\n quite fine bimanual motor sequences.  We also report that,\r\nnotably, the 10–12 Hz frequency alpha ERD was greater\r\n in amplitude during the successful than the unsuccessful\r\n putts over the frontal midline (Fz and Cz electrodes)\r\n and arm and hand region of the right primary sensorimotor\r\n area (C4 electrode).  The stronger the alpha ERD,\r\nthe lower the error in the unsuccessful putts.  These results\r\n taken together indicate that high-frequency alpha rhythms\r\n over frontal areas are specifically implicated in the fine\r\n motor control behind the successful putts.  Therefore,\r\nthey are in agreement with the notion that high- but\r\n not low-frequency alpha ERD displays a motorotopic\r\n representation over the primary sensorimotor cortex and\r\n is associated with active task-specific processes (Arroyo\r\n et al. 1993;  Toro et al. 1994;  Pfurtscheller et al. 1997,\r\n2000;  Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999).  In line with\r\n its meaning (Klimesch, 1999), the lack of difference\r\n of low-frequency alpha ERD between successful and\r\n unsuccessful putts suggests that general arousal, attention\r\n and effort did not characterize winning performance.\r\n The high-frequency alpha ERD over the right primary\r\n sensorimotor cortex was maximum during the successful\r\n putts, suggesting that a fine cortical control of the left\r\n arm and hand movements is crucial for that winning\r\n performance.  Of note, these results contribute to the\r\n debate on the functional significance and hemispheric\r\n distribution of alpha rhythms recorded during sporting\r\n performance.  An inhibitory increase in alpha power\r\n (8–12 Hz) in the left hemisphere before the performance\r\n of skilled marksmen (Hatfield et al. 1984) and archers\r\n (Salazar et al. 1990;  Landers et al. 1994;  Shaw, 1996)\r\n has already been shown;  this would favour visual–spatial\r\n processes in the right hemisphere.  Furthermore, a\r\n correlation has been reported between the reduction in\r\n power of right parietal alpha power (ERD) and skilled\r\n karate performance (Del Percio et al. 2007b).  In contrast,\r\nother studies have pointed to a bilateral increase in alpha\r\n power during skilled karate performance (Collins et al.\r\n 1990), and an inhibitory increase in alpha power over the\r\n right hemisphere during skilled golf performance (Crews\r\n & Landers, 1993).  Bearing in mind these data, the present\r\n study shows that baseline alpha power is not crucial\r\n either for the hemispherical alpha ERD topography or for\r\n successful putts.  This finding indicates that relationships\r\n between the topography of baseline alpha power and\r\n subsequent cognitive–motor processes are quite complex,\r\npossibly depending on the specific tasks to be performed.\r\n Furthermore, it agrees with previous evidence showing\r\n that high baseline power of bilateral alpha rhythms\r\n C 2008 The Authors.  Journal compilation C 2008 The Physiological Society\r\n J Physiol 586.1 Brain rhythms and successful golf putts 137\r\n predicts good cognitive performance in both visual\r\n stimulus encoding and memory formation (Neubauer\r\n & Freudenthaler, 1995;  Klimesch, 1999;  Babiloni et al.\r\n 2006), but not in successful performance of fine motor\r\n acts.  It is still a matter of debate whether an enhanced\r\n alpha power represents a general pattern of cortical\r\n neural inhibition common to all skilled and target\r\n sports (Shaw, 1996;  Palva & Palva, 2007).  If this is\r\n the case, hemispheric differences in preparatory alpha\r\n power among sporting gestures might reflect specific\r\n inhibitory versus excitatory processes associated with\r\n exogenous versus endogenous direction of attention and\r\n with verbal versus spatial processes (Wertheim, 1981;\r\n Shaw, 1996;  Klimesch, 1999).  In this framework, golf\r\n putting performance would be characterized by excitatory\r\n desynchronization of frontal alpha rhythms during action\r\n execution, in line with the traditional model of alpha power\r\n modulation (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva, 1999;  Palva &\r\n Palva, 2007).  On the whole, the present results indicate\r\n that high-resolution EEG techniques and analysis of\r\n high-frequency alpha rhythms (about 10–12 Hz) represent\r\n a powerful approach to mapping the topography of cortical\r\n task-specific processes accompanying sporting gestures.\r\n We also report that the successful putts were additionally\r\n characterized by high-frequency alpha ERD over the\r\n medial prefrontal, cingulate and/or supplementary motor\r\n areas.  These cortical areas play a pivotal role in\r\n the planning, selection and regulation of learned\r\n complex sequences performed with both arms and both\r\n hands, thanks to their bilateral anatomical connectivity\r\n (Rosenbaumet al. 1992, 2001;  Wiesendanger & Wise, 1992;\r\n Ashe et al. 2006).  The medial prefrontal cortex is bilaterally\r\n interconnected to the cingulate and supplementary motor\r\n areas (Rouiller et al. 1994), which have strong bilateral\r\n connections to motor effectors (Penfield & Welch, 1949;\r\n Brinkman, 1984;  Lim et al. 1994;  Kazennikov et al. 1998)\r\n and to basal ganglia nuclei (Wiesendanger et al. 1996).\r\n The putative specific role of these areas in the control of\r\n the successful putts can be derived from the following\r\n recent neurophysiological evidence.  Medial prefrontal\r\n and anterior cingulate areas represent explicit processes\r\n (subject’s intention, awareness) associated with bilateral\r\n motor sequences, having an inhibitory effect on automatic\r\n or implicit processes (Destrebecqz & Cleeremans,\r\n2001;  Destrebecqz et al. 2005), whereas cingulate and\r\n supplementary motor areas may represent the automatic\r\n or implicit processes, subserving temporal and ordinal\r\n representation of the motor sequence (Deiber et al. 1991;\r\n Ashe et al. 2006).\r\n In conclusion, the findings of the present study indicate\r\n that the modulation of high-frequency alpha rhythms\r\n over associative, premotor and non-dominant primary\r\n sensorimotor areas may represent the basic physiological\r\n mechanism underlying the fine motor control which is\r\n the basis of the putts, and appears to be predictive of"

Today, he had no lunch date planned -again - and would probably therefore have stayed at his club, and eaten a lightly grilled Dover sole, with potatoes garnished with parsley and boiled to bits, followed by a large heap of trifle.  A glass or two of Sancerre.  And coffee.  And then the afternoon, with whatever that might bring.\r\n But today he felt oddly impelled not to do that.  He flexed the muscles in his cut hand, poured himself another cup of tea, looked with curious dispassion at the large kitchen knife that still lay by the fine bone china teapot, and waited for a moment to see what he would do next.  What he did next, in fact, was to walk upstairs.\r\n His house was rather chill in its formal perfection, and looked much as people who buy reproduction furniture would like their houses to look.  Except of course that everything here was genuine - crystal, mahogany and Wilton - and only looked as if it might be fake because there was no life to any of it.\r\n He walked up into his workroom, which was the only room in the house that was not sterile with order, but here the disorder of books and papers was instead sterile with neglect.  A thin film of dust had settled over everything.  Michael had not been into it in weeks, and the cleaner was under strict instructions to leave it well alone.  He had not worked here since he edited the last edition of /Fathom/.  Not, of course, the actual last edition, but the last proper edition.  The last edition as far as /he/ was concerned.\r\n He set his china cup down in the fine dust and went to inspect his elderly record player.  On it he found an elderly recording of some Vivaldi wind concertos, set it to play and sat down.\r\n He waited again to see what he would do next and suddenly found to his surprise that he was already doing it, and it was this: he was /listening/ to the music.\r\n A bewildered look crept slowly across his face as he realised that he had never done this before.  He had /heard/ it many, many times and thought that it made a very pleasant noise.  Indeed, he found that it made a pleasant background against which to discuss the concert season, but it had never before occurred to him that there was anything actually to /listen/ to.\r\n He sat thunderstruck by the interplay of melody and counterpoint which suddenly stood revealed to him with a clarity that owed nothing to the dust-ridden surface of the record or the fourteen-year-old stylus.\r\n But with this revelation came an almost immediate sense of disappointment, which confused him all the more.  The music suddenly revealed to him was oddly unfulfilling.  It was as if his capacity to understand the music had suddenly increased up to and far beyond the music's ability to satisfy it, all in one dramatic moment.\r\n He strained to listen for what was missing, and felt that the music was like a flightless bird that didn't even know what capacity it had lost.  It walked very well, but it walked where it should soar, it walked where it should swoop, it walked where it should climb and bank and dive, it walked where it should thrill with the giddiness of flight.  It never even looked up.\r\n He looked up.\r\n After a while he became aware that all he was doing was simply staring stupidly at the ceiling.  He shook his head, and discovered that the perception had faded, leaving him feeling slightly sick and dizzy.\r\n It had not vanished entirely, but had dropped deep inside him, deeper than he could reach.\r\n The music continued.  It was an agreeable enough assortment of pleasant sounds in the background, but it no longer stirred him.\r\n He needed some clues as to what it was he had just experienced, and a thought flicked momentarily at the back of his mind as to where he might find them.  He let go of the thought in anger, but it flicked at him again, and kept on flicking at him until at last he acted upon it.\r\n From under his desk he pulled out the large tin wastepaper bin.\r\n Since he had barred his cleaning lady from even coming in here for the moment, the bin had remained unemptied and he found in it the tattered shreds of what he was looking for with the contents of an ashtray emptied over them.\r\n He overcame his distaste with grim determination and slowly jiggled around the bits of the hated object on his desk, clumsily sticking them together with bits of sticky tape that curled around and stuck the wrong bit to the wrong bit and stuck the right bit to his pudgy fingers and then to the desk, until at last there lay before him, crudely reassembled, a copy of /Fathom/.  As edited by the execrable creature A.\r\n K. Ross.\r\n Appalling.\r\n He turned the sticky lumpish pages as if he was picking over chicken giblets.  Not a single line drawing of Joan Sutherland or Marilyn Horne anywhere.  No profiles of any of the major Cork Street art dealers, not a one.\r\n His series on the Rossettis: discontinued.\r\n 'Green Room Gossip': discontinued.\r\n He shook his head in incredulity and then he found the article he was after.\r\n 'Music and Fractal Landscapes' by Richard MacDuff.\r\n He skipped over the first couple of paragraphs of introduction and picked it up further on:\r\n  Mathematical analysis and computer modelling are revealing to us that the shapes and processes we encounter in nature -the way that plants grow, the way that mountains erode or rivers flow, the way that snowflakes or islands achieve their shapes, the way that light plays on a surface, the way the milk folds and spins into your coffee as you stir it, the way that laughter sweeps through a crowd of people - all these things in their seemingly magical complexity can be described by the interaction of mathematical processes that are, if anything, even more magical in their simplicity.\r\n Shapes that we think of as random are in fact the products of complex shifting webs of numbers obeying simple rules.  The very word 'natural' that we have often taken to mean 'unstructured' in fact describes shapes and processes that appear so unfathomably complex that we cannot consciously perceive the simple natural laws at work.\r\n They can all be described by numbers.\r\n Oddly, this idea seemed less revolting now to Michael than it had done on his first, scant reading.\r\n He read on with increasing concentration.\r\n We know, however, that the mind is capable of understanding these matters in all their complexity and in all their simplicity.  A ball flying through the air is responding to the force and direction with which it was thrown, the action of gravity, the friction of the air which it must expend its energy on overcoming, the turbulence of the air around its surface, and the rate and direction of the ball's spin.\r\n"
