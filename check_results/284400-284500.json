        "text":" to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here \r\nand there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. \r\nThey entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had \r\nvisited before; and found the mother and the children seated \r\nround the fire. \r\n\r\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still \r\nas statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who \r\nhad a book before him. The mother and her daughters were \r\nengaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet. \r\n\r\n‘And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.’ \r\n\r\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words. He had not \r\ndreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he and \r\nthe Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on. \r\n\r\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her \r\nhand up to her face. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n‘The colour hurts my eyes,’ she said. \r\n\r\nThe colour. Ah, poor Tiny Tim. \r\n\r\n‘They’re better now again,’ said Cratchit’s wife. ‘It makes \r\nthem weak by candle-light; and I wouldn’t show weak eyes \r\nto your father when he comes home, for the world. It must \r\nbe near his time.’ \r\n\r\n‘Past it rather,’ Peter answered, shutting up his book. ‘But \r\nI think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few \r\nlast evenings, mother.’ \r\n\r\nThey were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a \r\nsteady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once: \r\n‘I have known him walk with  —  I have known him walk \r\n\r\nwith Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed.’ \r\n\r\n‘And so have I,’ cried Peter. ‘Often.’ \r\n\r\n‘And so have I,’ exclaimed another. So had all. \r\n\r\n‘But he was very light to carry,’ she resumed, intent upon \r\nher work,’ and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: \r\nno trouble. And there is your father at the door.’ \r\n\r\nShe hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter \r\n —  he had need of it, poor fellow  —  came in. His tea \r\nwas ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should \r\nhelp him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon \r\nhis knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, \r\nas if they said,’ Don’t mind it, father. Don’t be grieved.’ \r\n\r\nBob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly \r\nto all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, \r\nand praised the industry and speed of Mrs Cratchit and the \r\ngirls. They would be done long before Sunday, he said. \r\n\r\n‘Sunday. You went to-day, then, Robert.’ said his wife. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n‘Yes, my dear,’ returned Bob. ‘I wish you could have gone. \r\nIt would have done you good to see how green a place it is. \r\nBut you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would walk \r\nthere on a Sunday. My little, little child.’ cried Bob. ‘My little \r\nchild.’ \r\n\r\nHe broke down all at once. He couldn’t help it. If he \r\ncould have helped it, he and his child would have been farther \r\napart perhaps than they were. \r\n\r\nHe left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, \r\nwhich was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas. \r\nThere was a chair set close beside the child, and there were \r\nsigns of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat \r\ndown in it, and when he had thought a little and composed \r\nhimself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what \r\nhad happened, and went down again quite happy. \r\n\r\nThey drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother \r\nworking still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness \r\nof Mr Scrooge’s nephew, whom he had scarcely seen \r\nbut once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and \r\n seeing that he looked a little -’ just a little down you know,’ \r\nsaid Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. ‘On \r\nwhich,’ said Bob,’ for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman \r\nyou ever heard, I told him. ‘I am heartily sorry for it, \r\nMr Cratchit,’ he said,’ and heartily sorry for your good wife.’ \r\nBy the bye, how he ever knew that, I don’t know.’ \r\n\r\n‘Knew what, my dear.’ \r\n\r\n‘Why, that you were a good wife,’ replied Bob. \r\n\r\n‘Everybody knows that.’ said Peter. \r\n\r\n‘Very well observed, my boy.’ cried Bob. ‘I hope they do. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n‘Heartily sorry,’ he said,’ for your good wife. If I can be of \r\nservice to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card,’ that’s \r\nwhere I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it wasn’t,’ cried Bob,’ \r\nfor the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so \r\nmuch as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It \r\nreally seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt \r\nwith us.’ \r\n\r\n‘I’m sure he’s a good soul.’ said Mrs Cratchit. \r\n\r\n‘You would be surer of it, my dear,’ returned Bob,’ if you \r\nsaw and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised - mark \r\nwhat I say.  —  if he got Peter a better situation.’ \r\n\r\n‘Only hear that, Peter,’ said Mrs Cratchit. \r\n\r\n‘And then,’ cried one of the girls,’ Peter will be keeping \r\ncompany with some one, and setting up for himself.’ \r\n\r\n‘Get along with you.’ retorted Peter, grinning. \r\n\r\n‘It’s just as likely as not,’ said Bob,’ one of these days; \r\nthough there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however \r\nand when ever we part from one another, I am sure we shall \r\nnone of us forget poor Tiny Tim  —  shall we  —  or this first \r\nparting that there was among us.’ \r\n\r\n‘Never, father.’ cried they all. \r\n\r\n‘And I know,’ said Bob,’ I know, my dears, that when we \r\nrecollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was \r\na little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, \r\nand forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.’ \r\n\r\n‘No, never, father.’ they all cried again. \r\n\r\n‘I am very happy,’ said little Bob,’ I am very happy.’ \r\n\r\nMrs Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the \r\n\r\ntwo young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nshook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was \r\nfrom God. \r\n\r\n‘Spectre,’ said Scrooge,’ something informs me that our \r\nparting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. \r\nTell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead.’ \r\n\r\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as \r\nbefore  —  though at a different time, he thought: indeed, \r\nthere seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they \r\nwere in the Future  —  into the resorts of business men, but \r\nshowed him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for \r\nanything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, \r\nuntil besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment. \r\n\r\n‘This courts,’ said Scrooge,’ through which we hurry now, \r\nis where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length \r\nof time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be, in \r\ndays to come.’ \r\n\r\nThe Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere. \r\n\r\n‘The house is yonder,’ Scrooge exclaimed. ‘Why do you \r\npoint away.’ \r\n\r\nThe inexorable finger underwent no change. \r\n\r\nScrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked \r\nin. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not \r\nthe same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The \r\n Phantom pointed as before. \r\n\r\nHe joined it once again, and wondering why and whither \r\nhe had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. \r\nHe paused to look round before entering. \r\n\r\nA churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man whose name \r\nhe had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nworthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and \r\nweeds, the growth of vegetation’s death, not life; choked up \r\nwith too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy \r\nplace. \r\n\r\nThe Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down \r\nto One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom \r\nwas exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new \r\nmeaning in its solemn shape. \r\n\r\n‘Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,’ \r\nsaid Scrooge, ‘answer me one question. Are these the shadows \r\nof the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things \r\nthat May be, only.’ \r\n\r\nStill the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which \r\nit stood. \r\n\r\n‘Men’s courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, \r\nif persevered in, they must lead,’ said Scrooge. ‘But if the \r\ncourses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is \r\nthus with what you show me.’ \r\n\r\nThe Spirit was immovable as ever. \r\n\r\nScrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following \r\nthe finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave \r\nhis own name, Ebenezer Scrooge. \r\n\r\n‘Am I that man who lay upon the bed.’ he cried, upon his \r\nknees. \r\nThe finger pointed from the grave to him, and back \r\nagain. \r\n\r\n‘No, Spirit. Oh no, no.’ \r\n\r\nThe finger still was there. \r\n\r\n‘Spirit.’ he cried, tight clutching at its robe,’ hear me. I am \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nnot the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been \r\nbut for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all \r\nhope.’ \r\n\r\nFor the first time the hand appeared to shake. \r\n\r\n‘Good Spirit,’ he pursued, as down upon the ground he \r\nfell before it:’ Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. \r\nAssure me that I yet may change these shadows you have \r\nshown me, by an altered life.’ \r\n\r\nThe kind hand trembled. \r\n\r\n‘I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it \r\nall the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. \r\nThe Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will \r\nnot shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may \r\nsponge away the writing on this stone.’ \r\n\r\nIn his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to \r\nfree itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it. \r\nThe Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him. \r\n\r\nHolding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate aye \r\nreversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom’s hood and \r\ndress. It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nStave 5: The End of It \r\n\r\n\r\nY\r\nY\r\nes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, \r\nthe room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time \r\nbefore him was his own, to make amends in! \r\n\r\n‘I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.’ \r\n\r\nScrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. ‘The Spirits of \r\n\r\nall Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley. Heaven, \r\n\r\nand the Christmas Time be praised for this. I say it on my \r\n\r\nknees, old Jacob, on my knees.’ \r\n\r\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good inten\r\n\r\n\r\ntions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his \r\n\r\ncall. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the \r\n\r\nSpirit, and his face was wet with tears. \r\n\r\n‘They are not torn down. ’ cried Scrooge, folding one of \r\n\r\nhis bed-curtains in his arms,’ they are not torn down, rings \r\n\r\nand all. They are here  —  I am here  —  the shadows of the \r\n\r\nthings that would have been, may be dispelled. They will be. \r\n\r\nI know they will.’ \r\n\r\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; \r\n\r\nturning them inside out, putting them on upside down, \r\n\r\ntearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to ev\r\n\r\n\r\nery kind of extravagance. \r\n\r\n‘I don’t know what to do.’ cried Scrooge, laughing and \r\n\r\ncrying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoon of \r\n\r\nhimself with his stockings. ‘I am as light as a feather, I am \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nas happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I am as \r\ngiddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody. \r\nA happy New Year to all the world. Hallo here. Whoop. Hallo.’ \r\n\r\n\r\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing \r\nthere: perfectly winded. \r\n\r\n‘There’s the saucepan that the gruel was in.’ cried Scrooge, \r\nstarting off again, and going round the fireplace. ‘There’s \r\nthe door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered. \r\nThere’s the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, \r\nsat. There’s the window where I saw the wandering Spirits. \r\nIt’s all right, it’s all true, it all happened. Ha ha ha.’ \r\n\r\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so \r\nmany years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. \r\nThe father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs. \r\n\r\n‘I don’t know what day of the month it is.’ said Scrooge. \r\n‘I don’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t \r\nknow anything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. \r\nI’d rather be a baby. Hallo. Whoop. Hallo here.’ \r\n\r\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing \r\nout the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang, \r\nhammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, \r\nclash. Oh, glorious, glorious. \r\n\r\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his \r\nhead. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; \r\ncold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; \r\nHeavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious. \r\nGlorious. \r\n\r\n‘What’s to-day.’ cried Scrooge, calling downward to a \r\n\r\n10  \r\n\r\n \r\nboy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look \r\nabout him. \r\n\r\n‘Eh.’ returned the boy, with all his might of wonder. \r\n\r\n‘What’s to-day, my fine fellow.’ said Scrooge. \r\n\r\n‘To-day.’ replied the boy. ‘Why, Christmas Day.’ \r\n\r\n‘It’s Christmas Day.’ said Scrooge to himself. ‘I haven’t \r\nmissed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can \r\ndo anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they \r\ncan. Hallo, my fine fellow.’ \r\n\r\n‘Hallo.’ returned the boy. \r\n\r\n‘Do you know the Poulterer’s, in the next street but one, \r\nat the corner.’ Scrooge inquired. \r\n‘I should hope I did,’ replied the lad. \r\n‘An intelligent boy.’ said Scrooge. ‘A remarkable boy. Do \r\n\r\nyou know whether they’ve sold the prize Turkey that was \r\nhanging up there  —  Not the little prize Turkey: the big \r\none.’ \r\n\r\n‘What, the one as big as me.’ returned the boy. \r\n\r\n‘What a delightful boy.’ said Scrooge. ‘It’s a pleasure to \r\ntalk to him. Yes, my buck.’ \r\n\r\n‘It’s hanging there now,’ replied the boy. \r\n\r\n‘Is it.’ said Scrooge. ‘Go and buy it.’ \r\n\r\n‘Walk-er.’ exclaimed the boy. \r\n\r\n‘No, no,’ said Scrooge, ‘I am in earnest. Go and buy it, \r\n and tell them to bring it here, that I may give them the direction \r\nwhere to take it. Come back with the man, and I’ll \r\ngive you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five \r\nminutes and I’ll give you half-a-crown.’ \r\n\r\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady \r\n\r\n 10 \r\n\r\n \r\nhand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast. \r\n\r\n‘I’ll send it to Bon Cratchit’s.’ whispered Scrooge, rubbing \r\nhis hands, and splitting with a laugh. ‘He shan’t know \r\nwho sends it. It’s twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never \r\nmade such a joke as sending it to Bob’s will be.’ \r\n\r\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady \r\n\r\none, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to \r\n\r\nopen the street door, ready for the coming of the poulter\r\n\r\n\r\ner’s man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker \r\n\r\ncaught his eye. \r\n\r\n‘I shall love it, as long as I live.’ cried Scrooge, patting it \r\nwith his hand. ‘I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an \r\nhonest expression it has in its face. It’s a wonderful knocker. \r\n\r\n —  Here’s the Turkey. Hallo. Whoop. How are you. Merry \r\nChristmas.’ \r\nIt was a Turkey. He never could have stood upon his legs, \r\n\r\nthat bird. He would have snapped them short off in a min\r\n\r\n\r\nute, like sticks of sealing-wax. \r\n\r\n‘Why, it’s impossible to carry that to Camden Town,’ said \r\n\r\nScrooge. ‘You must have a cab.’ \r\n\r\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with \r\n\r\nwhich he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which \r\n\r\nhe paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recom\r\n\r\n\r\npensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle \r\n\r\nwith which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and \r\n\r\nchuckled till he cried. \r\n\r\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued \r\nto shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even \r\nwhen you don’t dance while you are at it. But if he had cut \r\n\r\n10  \r\n\r\n \r\nthe end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of stickingplaster \r\nover it, and been quite satisfied. \r\n\r\nHe dressed himself all in his best, and at last got out into \r\nthe streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as \r\nhe had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and \r\nwalking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every \r\none with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant, \r\nin a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows \r\nsaid,’ Good morning, sir. A merry Christmas to you.’ And \r\nScrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds \r\nhe had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears. \r\n\r\nHe had not gone far, when coming on towards him he \r\nbeheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his \r\ncounting-house the day before, and said,’ Scrooge and Marley’s, \r\nI believe.’ It sent a pang across his heart to think how \r\nthis old gentleman would look upon him when they met; \r\nbut he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took \r\nit. \r\n\r\n‘My dear sir,’ said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking \r\nthe old gentleman by both his hands. ‘How do you do. \r\nI hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of you. A \r\nmerry Christmas to you, sir.’ \r\n\r\n‘Mr Scrooge.’ \r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Scrooge. ‘That is my name, and I fear it may \r\nnot be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And \r\nwill you have the goodness’  —  here Scrooge whispered in \r\nhis ear. \r\n\r\n‘Lord bless me.’ cried the gentleman, as if his breath were \r\ntaken away. ‘My dear Mr Scrooge, are you serious.’ \r\n\r\n 10 \r\n\r\n \r\n"

        "text":"Breaking Writer's Block: Morning Pages Day and Night \r\n\r\n by Noelle Sterne \r\n\r\n Three shelves in my library are crammed with guaranteed-to-break-your-writer's-block books.  All have a thick dust blanket, some have grown moss, and a few have put down roots.\r\n\r\n One book, though, never even got to the shelf.  Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way (Tarcher, 1992) went with me everywhere and, to my astonished wonder, revived my lifelong, nearly stone-cold dream of writing consistently.  BC—Before Cameron—all my fervent declarations and self-promises, after a few heady days or weeks, crumbled like smashed cookies before the screaming demands of the rest of life.  \r\n\r\n Cameron understands this.  As her bestsellerdom confirms, she has reawakened many blocked writers, artists, composers, sculptors, cinematographers, and other \"creatives,\" as she calls us, to get going again and keep moving (p. 139).  She is a true doctor of letters, and her elixir works whatever your mode or malady and whenever you start treatment.\r\n\r\n Cameron's rehabilitative program is carefully designed to entice you back into writing.  Over twelve weeks, in gradual doses of one chapter a week, she prescribes explicit assignments that nudge you to regained respect for yourself and reacquaintance with your creativity.  Integral to the treatment is what she calls the Morning Pages (MP).  But unlike the assignments, their contents are not prescribed at all.  \r\n Combatting the Inner Censor: Morning Pages\r\n\r\n At first jot, the MP seem like all those timeworn, well-meaning platitudes from our early writing teachers about keeping journals and diaries.  But the MP are different.  They jumpstart our inventive engines so we can reach the cruising speed of uncompromising daily writing. \r\n\r\n Their main purpose is to clear our heads of the pervasive preoccupying gunk we carry around that drags us from our work or stops us cold.  As Cameron tells us, the MP are the unjudging receivers of that constant stream of dismal thoughts, feelings, railings, and lamentations that bombard our minds and get in our way. \r\n\r\n You know the ones: whiny, grossly self-pitying, obsessively repetitive.  The MP provide a safe, nontoxic dumping ground for these landfills of jealousies, rages, and self-indulgent trivialities.  She consoles us, \"Nothing is too petty, too silly, too stupid, or too weird to be included\" (p.  10).\r\n\r\n You may be protesting, \"Wait a minute.  This is the stuff I spilled out ad nauseam in my secret adolescent diary, cursing my existence for not yet having a bestseller at 14.\" \r\n\r\n Exactly.  Well, now it's not only okay, it's required.\r\n\r\n Don't worry, as I did, that the MP must be \"real\" writing.  Cameron assures us otherwise, not that this should be discouraged.  If you're already doing the Pages, you've probably discovered that occasionally, without preparation or warning, a little gem pops through.  You've experienced that mysterious creative state beyond conscious effort that results only from consistent application of pen to paper or fingers to keyboard. \r\n\r\n Such times are surely to be cherished.  But, as we all know, they're regrettably few.   And one way to induce more of them is by doing the Morning Pages.\r\n\r\n Cameron specifies only two conditions.  First, whatever we write, however tortured, small-minded, mean-spirited, or monotonous, we must daily fill three handwritten pages.  They can be looseleaf pages, loose pages, or notebook pages (not one of those tiny ones).  And second, we should fill our pages in the morning. \r\n\r\n She coaxes us to the task with several great reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  In their innocuous way, the MP combat \"the Censor,\" that ubiquitous inner shrew that never shuts up (p.  12).  Even if, by other people's standards, we have an all-A life, or a list of works longer than Mozart's, the Censor endlessly informs us that we never do enough or do it well enough.\r\n\r\n 2.   In bold rebellion to the Censor, the Morning Pages feed our \"inner child\" (p.  12), that twinkly part of us long imprisoned by parents, religion, school, and society.  Whether we know it or not, our child is giggling to break out.\r\n\r\n 3.  When we do the MP faithfully, they get us beyond the Censor's reach to the other side \"of our fear, of our negativity, of our moods.\"  This is the place where \"we find our own quiet center\" and our own triumphant voice (p.  12).\r\n\r\n With Cameron's excellent reasons, I've discovered a few others:\r\n\r\n4.  The Morning Pages, despite their dubious quality, undeniably count as writing.  Never mind that the rest of the day whizzes by with jobs, kids, partners, laundry, dental appointments, and all the other relentless to-dos.  You've written something besides a list of groceries or car problems. \r\n\r\n 5.  You feel like a serious, committed writer doing the MP.  They tell you, Yes, I am keeping this daily promise to myself.\r\n\r\n 6.  You've put your writing first.  If you must fault yourself for how you write, you can at least stop the self-flogging for not writing at all.    \r\n\r\n 7.  The MP give you an ongoing, physical record of progress.  You can label your notebooks by the year or quarter and prop them on a bookshelf or file them in a cabinet.  Take heart and encouragement watching the shelf or cabinet fill with the fruits of your self-discipline.\r\n\r\n Whatever your method, know that the MP work.  Cameron herself is ample evidence, a veteran of a decade (!)  of doing them, with an impressive, ever-growing list of writing and other creative accomplishments. \r\n\r\n The testimonies to Cameron's methods by grateful unblocked creatives span all the arts, with many \"made-it\" names you'd instantly recognize.  It's sobering to realize that success, fame, position, wealth, bestsellers, talk shows, even your mother's approval don't automatically immunize you from the blocking affliction.  Cameron tells of a successful writer-producer who religiously rose at 5:00 a.m.  every day to do the MP and credits them \"with inspiration for her recent screenplays and clarity in planning her network specials\" (p.  9). \r\n Doing Your Morning Pages at Night\r\n\r\n My testimony is somewhat less dramatic, and I'm still a novice at just past three years.  But unless the universal pen supply dries up, I will not quit.\r\n\r\n However, as you already may suspect from the title of this piece, I've taken creative liberty with one of Cameron's fundamental conditions.  My Morning Pages are no longer done in the morning. \r\n\r\n After the first burst of perfect rule-following, as if by themselves, the early entries stopped.  An undeniably non-morning person, at first light I'm completely incapable of bounding eagerly out of bed, sweet-lipped and bright-eyed.  It's a feat to get up at all, much less do anything like writing. \r\n\r\n I work independently in my office residence, and I’ve learned that I must sneak into the day.  After dressing, I ease in by going out to the terrace and gather several essentials: coffee, daily meditative book, TV guide, newspaper or magazine, and the ubiquitous clipboard and pen.  I sit, sip, stare, sigh, survey the sky, smell the air, and, blurry eyes slowly focusing, take in the relatively newborn day.\r\n\r\n After a few jolts of caffeine, I begin to think about the day's demands and scribble them in a rough schedule.  Then I check out the prime time TV, read a feature (always looking for markets), and turn to the day's meditation for spiritual refueling.This routine has been a habit for years, and when the Morning Pages were added, before I got to the morning’s work it was almost lunchtime.  So my MP grew later and later.  At first I did them after lunch about 2, then between projects around 5:30.  Finally, they hit the evening and stuck.\r\n\r\n In the beginning, I felt like an irrevocable sinner.  But soon, I found that switching to the evening did not condemn me to metaphorless purgatory.  The MP at night, I saw with shocked relief, still did for me everything Cameron promised they would in the morning, and maybe more.\r\n\r\n They’re the cathartic receptacle of the day’s pettinesses and redundant gripes against those closest and most annoying.  They’re the open-armed accepters of ceaseless rationales and self-justifications.  They're the patient receivers of too-frequent cries of \"Nothing to say!”  And occasionally, they're the recorders of small, significant victories (\"Did 15 minutes on this piece today!\") .   \r\n Keeping Your Morning Pages Alive\r\n\r\n As the MP have continued to work, I've developed many ways to keep them working, whatever the time.  Like evolutionary adaptations for survival, these methods ensure that the Pages stay alive, in my heart, mind, and write brain.\r\n\r\n Here are some of them.\r\n\r\n Plunk paper and pens everywhere — main writing area, kitchen, bedside night table, bathroom near the magazines, briefcase, tote, car seat.  The MP can be done anywhere and at any time.\r\n Use any waiting time anywhere to do them, even if you don’t finish them in a single stint.\r\n Finish the day’s MP whenever you next can, as long as it’s before midnight.\r\n Do them slowly or quickly.  At first you may need 45 minutes or more, but eventually, according to Cameron, most writers settle into 10 to 15 minutes.  This time leaves room for a little thinking and eventually some honesty.\r\n Do them neatly or messily, and don’t worry about whether you’ll be able to read them later.\r\n If you feel absolutely blank, just keep writing, “I have nothing to write.”  Very soon you will.\r\n Keep doing the Pages.  Keep doing the Pages.\r\n\r\n What if you miss a day, or night, completely?  It feels awful, worse than stealing from your partner's pocket. \r\n\r\n When I’ve missed an entry, I sometimes don’t realize it for an hour or even a day.  But the instant I remember, I stop everything and pinpoint the exact moment this supposedly steadfast habit flew from my mind like a hawk from captivity. \r\n\r\n There’s only one thing to do — forgive myself.  And take corrective steps: set the clock, plaster signs all over the house, beg for help from my significant other.  Most crucial of all, I jump back on the horse and kick the pen into a gallop, whatever the hour.\r\n\r\n The MP work in the morning, afternoon, night, or any other time of day.  Despite all my rationalizations and naughty rebellions, I'm writing proof that they do what they're meant to. \r\n\r\n They've gotten me back to thinking and living like a writer.  They've helped resurrect my lifelong goal from the mountainous ashes of decades-long distractions. "

        "text":" He looked about him and decided instantly.  There was no delaying now.\r\n\r\n \"Supposing I do lay it on the top,\" he said, \"and go away, they'll know who took it.  I'm the last to close up.  Besides, other things will happen.\"\r\n\r\n At once he became the man of action.\r\n\r\n \"I must get out of this,\" he thought.\r\n\r\n He hurried into his little room, took down his light overcoat and hat, locked his desk, and grabbed the satchel.  Then he turned out all but one light and opened the door.  He tried to put on his old assured air, but it was almost gone.  He was repenting rapidly.\r\n\r\n \"I wish I hadn't done that,\" he said.  \"That was a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n He walked steadily down the street, greeting a night watchman whom he knew who was trying doors.  He must get out of the city, and that quickly.\r\n\r\n \"I wonder how the trains run?\"  he thought.\r\n\r\n Instantly he pulled out his watch and looked.  It was nearly half-past one.\r\n\r\n At the first drugstore he stopped, seeing a long-distance telephone booth inside.  It was a famous drugstore, and contained one of the first private telephone booths ever erected.  \"I want to use your 'phone a minute,\" he said to the night clerk.\r\n\r\n The latter nodded.\r\n\r\n \"Give me 1643,\" he called to Central, after looking up the Michigan Central depot number.  Soon he got the ticket agent.\r\n\r\n \"How do the trains leave here for Detroit?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n The man explained the hours.\r\n\r\n \"No more to-night?\"\r\n\r\n \"Nothing with a sleeper.  Yes, there is, too,\" he added.  \"There is a mail train out of here at three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n \"All right,\" said Hurstwood.  \"What time does that get to Detroit?\"\r\n\r\n He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal.  He was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon.\r\n\r\n \"Mayhew won't open the safe till nine,\" he thought.  \"They can't get on my track before noon.\"\r\n\r\n Then he thought of Carrie.  With what speed must he get her, if he got her at all.  She would have to come along.  He jumped into the nearest cab standing by.\r\n\r\n \"To Ogden Place,\" he said sharply.  \"I'll give you a dollar more if you make good time.\"\r\n\r\n The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was fairly fast, however.  On the way Hurstwood thought what to do.  Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the servant.\r\n\r\n \"Is Mrs. Drouet in?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said the astonished girl.\r\n\r\n \"Tell her to dress and come to the door at once.  Her husband is in the hospital, injured, and wants to see her.\"\r\n\r\n The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man's strained and emphatic manner.\r\n\r\n \"What!\"  said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for her clothes.\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Drouet is hurt and in the hospital.  He wants to see you.  The cab's downstairs.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgetting everything save the necessities.\r\n\r\n \"Drouet is hurt,\" said Hurstwood quickly.  \"He wants to see you.  Come quickly.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story.\r\n\r\n \"Get in,\" said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping after.\r\n\r\n The cabby began to turn the horse around.  \"Michigan Central depot,\" he said, standing up and speaking so low that Carrie could not hear, \"as fast as you can go.\" \r\n\r\n Chapter XXVIII\r\n\r\n A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW—THE SPIRIT DETAINED\r\n\r\n The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settling herself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked:\r\n\r\n \"What's the matter with him?  Is he hurt badly?\"\r\n\r\n \"It isn't anything very serious,\" Hurstwood said solemnly.  He was very much disturbed over his own situation, and now that he had Carrie with him, he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law.  Therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his plans distinctly.\r\n\r\n Carrie did not forget that there was something to be settled between her and Hurstwood, but the thought was ignored in her agitation.  The one thing was to finish this strange pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n \"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n \"Way out on the South Side,\" said Hurstwood.  \"We'll have to take the train.  It's the quickest way.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie said nothing, and the horse gambolled on.  The weirdness of the city by night held her attention.  She looked at the long receding rows of lamps and studied the dark, silent houses.\r\n\r\n \"How did he hurt himself?\"  she asked—meaning what was the nature of his injuries.  Hurstwood understood.  He hated to lie any more than necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger.\r\n\r\n \"I don't know exactly,\" he said.  \"They just called me up to go and get you and bring you out.  They said there wasn't any need for alarm, but that I shouldn't fail to bring you.\"\r\n\r\n The man's serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent, wondering.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry.  For one in so delicate a position he was exceedingly cool.  He could only think of how needful it was to make the train and get quietly away.  Carrie seemed quite tractable, and he congratulated himself.\r\n\r\n In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on.\r\n\r\n \"You wait here,\" he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \"while I get the tickets.\"\r\n\r\n \"Have I much time to catch that train for Detroit?\"  he asked of the agent.\r\n\r\n \"Four minutes,\" said the latter.\r\n\r\n He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible.\r\n\r\n \"Is it far?\"  said Carrie, as he hurried back.\r\n\r\n \"Not very,\" he said.  \"We must get right in.\"\r\n\r\n He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then hurried after.\r\n\r\n There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches.  As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting.  They entered the rear day coach and sat down.  Almost immediately, \"All aboard,\" resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started.\r\n\r\n Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious—this going to a depot—but said nothing.  The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined.\r\n\r\n \"How have you been?\"  asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed easier.\r\n\r\n \"Very well,\" said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter.  She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter.  Hurstwood contemplated her and felt this.  He was not disturbed that it should be so.  He did not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter.  It was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly.  He was only thinking how he should explain.  Even this was not the most serious thing in his mind, however.  His own deed and present flight were the great shadows which weighed upon him.\r\n\r\n \"What a fool I was to do that,\" he said over and over.  \"What a mistake!\"\r\n\r\n In his sober senses, he could scarcely realise that the thing had been done.  He could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice.  He had often read of such things, and had thought they must be terrible, but now that the thing was upon him, he only sat and looked into the past.  The future was a thing which concerned the Canadian line.  He wanted to reach that.  As for the rest he surveyed his actions for the evening, and counted them parts of a great mistake.\r\n\r\n \"Still,\" he said, \"what could I have done?\"\r\n\r\n Then he would decide to make the best of it, and would begin to do so by starting the whole inquiry over again.  It was a fruitless, harassing round, and left him in a queer mood to deal with the proposition he had in the presence of Carrie.\r\n\r\n The train clacked through the yards along the lake front, and ran rather slowly to Twenty-fourth Street.  Brakes and signals were visible without.  The engine gave short calls with its whistle, and frequently the bell rang.  Several brakemen came through, bearing lanterns.  They were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for a long run.\r\n\r\n Presently it began to gain speed, and Carrie saw the silent streets flashing by in rapid succession.  The engine also began its whistle-calls of four parts, with which it signalled danger to important crossings.\r\n\r\n \"Is it very far?\"  asked Carrie.  \"Not so very,\" said Hurstwood.  He could hardly repress a smile at her simplicity.  He wanted to explain and conciliate her, but he also wanted to be well out of Chicago.\r\n\r\n In the lapse of another half-hour it became apparent to Carrie that it was quite a run to wherever he was taking her, anyhow.\r\n\r\n \"Is it in Chicago?\"  she asked nervously.  They were now far beyond the city limits, and the train was scudding across the Indiana line at a great rate.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he said, \"not where we are going.\"\r\n\r\n There was something in the way he said this which aroused her in an instant.\r\n\r\n Her pretty brow began to contract.\r\n\r\n \"We are going to see Charlie, aren't we?\"  she asked.\r\n\r\n He felt that the time was up.  An explanation might as well come now as later.  Therefore, he shook his head in the most gentle negative.\r\n\r\n \"What?\"  said Carrie.  She was nonplussed at the possibility of the errand being different from what she had thought.\r\n\r\n He only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way.\r\n\r\n \"Well, where are you taking me, then?\"  she asked, her voice showing the quality of fright.\r\n\r\n \"I'll tell you, Carrie, if you'll be quiet.  I want you to come along with me to another city,\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh,\" said Carrie, her voice rising into a weak cry.  \"Let me off.  I don't want to go with you.\"\r\n\r\n She was quite appalled at the man's audacity.  This was something which had never for a moment entered her head.  Her one thought now was to get off and away.  If only the flying train could be stopped, the terrible trick would be amended.\r\n\r\n She arose and tried to push out into the aisle—anywhere.  She knew she had to do something.  Hurstwood laid a gentle hand on her.\r\n\r\n \"Sit still, Carrie,\" he said.  \"Sit still.  It won't do you any good to get up here.  Listen to me and I'll tell you what I'll do.  Wait a moment.\"\r\n\r\n She was pushing at his knees, but he only pulled her back.  No one saw this little altercation, for very few persons were in the car, and they were attempting to doze.\r\n\r\n \"I won't,\" said Carrie, who was, nevertheless, complying against her will.  \"Let me go,\" she said.  \"How dare you?\"  and large tears began to gather in her eyes.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty, and ceased to think of his own situation.  He must do something with this girl, or she would cause him trouble.  He tried the art of persuasion with all his powers aroused.\r\n\r\n \"Look here now, Carrie,\" he said, \"you mustn't act this way.  I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.  I don't want to do anything to make you feel bad.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh,\" sobbed Carrie, \"oh, oh—oo—o!\"\r\n\r\n \"There, there,\" he said, \"you mustn't cry.  Won't you listen to me?  Listen to me a minute, and I'll tell you why I came to do this thing.  I couldn't help it.  I assure you I couldn't.  Won't you listen?\"\r\n\r\n Her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not hear a word he said.\r\n\r\n \"Won't you listen?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"No, I won't,\" said Carrie, flashing up.  \"I want you to take me out of this, or I'll tell the conductor.  I won't go with you.  It's a shame,\" and again sobs of fright cut off her desire for expression.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood listened with some astonishment.  He felt that she had just cause for feeling as she did, and yet he wished that he could straighten this thing out quickly.  Shortly the conductor would come through for the tickets.  He wanted no noise, no trouble of any kind.  Before everything he must make her quiet.\r\n\r\n \"You couldn't get out until the train stops again,\" said Hurstwood.  \"It won't be very long until we reach another station.  You can get out then if you want to.  I won't stop you.  All I want you to do is to listen a moment.  You'll let me tell you, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n Carrie seemed not to listen.  She only turned her head toward the window, where outside all was black.  The train was speeding with steady grace across the fields and through patches of wood.  The long whistles came with sad, musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings were approached.\r\n\r\n Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that had been added at Chicago.  He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the tickets.  Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move.  She did not look about.\r\n\r\n When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved.\r\n\r\n \"You're angry at me because I deceived you,\" he said.  \"I didn't mean to, Carrie.  As I live I didn't.  I couldn't help it.  I couldn't stay away from you after the first time I saw you.\"\r\n\r\n He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board.  He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their relationship.  The money he had stolen he tried to shut out of his mind.\r\n\r\n \"Don't talk to me,\" said Carrie, \"I hate you.  I want you to go away from me.  I am going to get out at the very next station.\"\r\n\r\n She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke.\r\n\r\n \"All right,\" he said, \"but you'll hear me out, won't you?  After all you have said about loving me, you might hear me.  I don't want to do you any harm.  I'll give you the money to go back with when you go.  I merely want to tell you, Carrie.  You can't stop me from loving you, whatever you may think.\"\r\n\r\n He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply.  \"You think I have deceived you badly, but I haven't.  I didn't do it willingly.  I'm through with my wife.  She hasn't any claims on me.  I'll never see her any more.  That's why I'm here to- night.  That's why I came and got you.\"\r\n\r\n \"You said Charlie was hurt,\" said Carrie, savagely.  \"You deceived me.  You've been deceiving me all the time, and now you want to force me to run away with you.\"\r\n\r\n She was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again. "

The paparazzi\r\n could shut down the party?\r\n Especially if they knew\r\n Blair was here with Chuck.\r\n I'll go talk to security about Max.\r\n What's going on?\r\n Did you have something to do with this?\r\n No.  Dan arranged it for us.\r\n What \"us\"?\r\n The \"us\" I should have\r\n fought for when you called.\r\n The \"us\" that is not just you and me,\r\nbut you, me, and your baby.\r\n Then...\r\n W-why did you tell me to choose Louis?\r\n I thought it was selfish if\r\n I was the one to tell you\r\n to break up your family.\r\n That was the moment you\r\n chose not to be selfish?\r\n Well, timing has never\r\n been our strong suit.\r\n I had it all wrong.\r\n Just because Louis is\r\n the father of your baby\r\n does not mean you should be with him.\r\n You should be with me.\r\n Why?\r\n Because I'm going to love your\r\n baby as much as I love you.\r\n What is it?\r\n \"Gossip Girl\"\r\n Someone sent out a blast that I'm here...\r\n with you.\r\n I don't want any photos of\r\n us to get back to Louis\r\n before I can talk to him.\r\n I gotta get out of here.\r\n Wait.\r\n I wanna come with you.\r\n Hey, sorry to bother you guys.\r\n Just wanted to make sure\r\n you saw the \"Gossip Girl\" blast.\r\n We need to leave immediately.\r\n Yeah, I have a car here waiting for me.\r\n So do I.\r\n All right, perfect.\r\n Then they'll be down in the garage.\r\n We can go through there.  Come on.\r\n I'd like to have everyone's\r\n attention, please.\r\n Wow.  The paparazzi are aggressive tonight.\r\n They must really want\r\n a shot of our new \"It\" girl.\r\n I'd like to say a few words\r\n about my lovely niece\r\n Charlotte Rhodes.\r\n Since she didn't grow up in New York City,\r\nyou haven't had the opportunity\r\n to know what a wonderful\r\n young woman she is.\r\n I hope, starting tonight,\r\nyou get that chance.\r\n Charlie?\r\n Took you long enough,\r\nand I'm not talking about the\r\n walk from the lobby to here.\r\n Have a good trip, Nathaniel.\r\n Camus said that life is\r\n the sum of our choices.\r\n Choose wisely, and fortune smiles upon you.\r\n But choose poorly?\r\n You never know what price\r\n you'll have to pay.\r\n Hey.\r\n Hey.\r\n You okay?\r\n Yeah.  I'm okay adjacent.\r\n I'm sorry I came down\r\n so hard on you before.\r\n Eh, you were right.\r\n I was gonna tell Blair\r\n how I felt about her.\r\n You mean you were gonna\r\n tell her you love her?\r\n In spite of myself— and\r\n honestly, many times—\r\n in spite of her.\r\n I-I mean, I didn't want to.\r\n I kept trying to make it go away,\r\nbut how do you kill a feeling?\r\n I don't know.\r\n When you told me about the idea\r\n of rewriting the end of my story,\r\nI thought, maybe...\r\n maybe that's the answer.\r\n Then what stopped you?\r\n When I saw Blair, she'd just\r\n gotten off the phone with Chuck\r\n and she was heartbroken.\r\n You know, I've been so\r\n consumed with my own feelings,\r\nI wouldn't let myself see\r\n how much she loves Chuck.\r\n You were right.\r\n She didn't need my confession.\r\n She needed my help.\r\n Wow, that's...\r\n That's a really amazing thing to do, Dan.\r\n Yeah, well, I mean...\r\n It wasn't easy.\r\n But I do think, uh,\r\nthat I can give myself a new ending\r\n by making sure Chuck and Blair\r\n get the ending they deserve.\r\n I want her to be happy.\r\n Gotta head home and get\r\n started on this afterward.\r\n Dan...\r\n You're one of the good ones, you know?\r\n Thanks.\r\n You have fun at your party?\r\n When are you gonna leave me alone?\r\n Starting now, actually.\r\n I got some money, going back to Portland.\r\n Good.\r\n You think once I'm gone, you're free.\r\n The truth is, once I go, Ivy,\r\nyou are trapped in this lie forever.\r\n Look, I worked hard to get here.\r\n Trust me.  I couldn't be happier.\r\n Yeah, maybe for now.\r\n That'll wear off eventually.\r\n No actress wants to play the\r\n same role her entire life.\r\n This is more than just a role.\r\n This is my life now,\r\nand these people are my family.\r\n How can their love be real\r\n when you're a total fake?\r\n Whoa.  Are those paparazzi?\r\n Yeah.  They're chasing\r\n the car in front of us.\r\n Pretty aggressive.\r\n Yeah.  I think they're chasing my friends.\r\n I have to tell Louis face-to-face\r\n that the wedding is off.\r\n He—he deserves at least that.\r\n Are you sure you wanna do this?\r\n I mean, a-a prince, a fairy tale wedding.\r\n - This is all you ever wanted. \r\n - No.\r\n You're all I ever wanted.\r\n I love you.\r\n I love every part of you.\r\n I-I couldn't tell Louis\r\n that he would never lose me\r\n because it wasn't true.\r\n You're the one I never want to leave.\r\n Okay, h-how—how do you want to do this?\r\n First, we have to go to the consulate\r\n so I can tell Louis it's off, and then...\r\n I-I don't know.  We—we could go anywhere.\r\n Switzerland has impeccable schools\r\n or maybe Tokyo?\r\n They have opening ceremony\r\n and great test scores.\r\n Blair, Blair, we don't need to go anywhere.\r\n We can raise this baby right here.\r\n Look at them.\r\n Hey, grandfather.\r\n Yeah, well, I was a little\r\n delayed leaving the Empire,\r\nbut I'm on my way to\r\n Westchester airport now.\r\n Westchester?\r\n I thought I was taking you\r\n to the Upper East Side.\r\n What?  No.  No, no, no.\r\n Hey.  Hey, c—let me call you back.\r\n What?  No.  I-I have a flight out\r\n of Westchester County Airport\r\n in  minutes.\r\n Okay.  I just gotta get out of the park\r\n and then I can turn around.\r\n It's not a problem.\r\n All right.  Thank you.\r\n Those motorcycles are\r\n really out of control.\r\n What the hell are they doing?\r\n Oh, my God!\r\n Nate, I got your messages.\r\n Are Chuck and Blair okay?\r\n I don't know, but I saw the whole thing.\r\n I stayed with them until\r\n the ambulances came.\r\n They're with the doctors now.\r\n I spoke with the E.M.T.\r\n who brought them in.\r\n He said it's pretty bad.\r\n Okay.\r\n Okay.\r\n Eleanor, Cyrus, Harold, and Roman\r\n are all flying in on the\r\n next flight from Paris.\r\n Eleanor was distraught.\r\n Hey.\r\n Um...\r\n Serena texted me.\r\n Are Blair and Chuck all right?\r\n We don't know yet.\r\n We're hoping for the best.\r\n I'm gonna go track down the doctor\r\n and see if I can get an update.\r\n This is all Gossip Girl's fault.\r\n If she hadn't sent out that blast...\r\n Well, I'm not trying to defend her,\r\nbut it's not like Gossip\r\n Girl hopped on a motorcycle\r\n and chased Chuck and Blair through\r\n the streets of Manhattan.\r\n Well, she may as well have.\r\n If Gossip Girl didn't exist,\r\nChuck and Blair would not be\r\n in the hospital right now,\r\nfighting for their lives.\r\n You know, I spent the whole\r\n morning looking at old blasts,\r\nand it's unbelievable the\r\n amount of pain she's caused.\r\n This is just the culmination\r\n of years of damage.\r\n All right, so what do you want to do?\r\n Well, I wanna finish what Diana started.\r\n I wanna take Gossip Girl down for good.\r\n I'm with you,\r\nand I think we should use\r\n \"The Spectator\" to do it.\r\n Charlie...\r\n Are you okay?\r\n No.\r\n No, I'm—I'm not.\r\n This is all my fault.\r\n What are you talking about?\r\n Of course it's not.\r\n I sent the \"Gossip Girl\" blast.\r\n Why?\r\n I didn't do it to hurt Blair.\r\n I was just trying to protect myself.\r\n From what?\r\n Max showed up tonight.\r\n He was threatening to sell my story\r\n to the reporters covering the party.\r\n And I thought that if I sent the blast,\r\nthen the paparazzi would show up\r\n and would crash the party\r\n and it'd be shut down\r\n before Max could do any damage.\r\n But what damage could he do?\r\n Max is a complete fraud.\r\n Rufus, I'm sorry.\r\n It's me.  I'm the fraud.\r\n I just spoke to the doctor, and, um,\r\nthe good news is that...\r\n Blair is awake and responsive.\r\n And Chuck?\r\n Carol, it's me, Ivy.\r\n I gotta get out of here.\r\n I'm leaving tonight.\r\n This time, I'm not coming back.\r\n We all like to think\r\n that we're in the driver's\r\n seat of our own lives.\r\n But the truth is,\r\nthe idea that we can control\r\n our fate is an illusion.\r\n You can choose the most loyal friends,\r\nthe dream job...\r\n The truest love.\r\n There's been an accident.\r\n How bad?\r\n You know I wouldn't take a risk\r\n like this if it wasn't serious.\r\n I had no choice.\r\n Okay, Jack.  I'll get on the next plane.\r\n You'll meet us there?\r\n Of course.  Thank you, Diana.\r\n It's not me you should thank."

        "text":"Like many of us I’ve been in the position on a Tuesday or a Wednesday where I miss a workout or eat a piece of cake I wasn’t planning on.  As the surge of guilt runs through me, I quickly brush it aside with “It’s okay, I’ll start again on Monday.”  I’m as guilty of this as everyone else, and am glad to see I’m not alone – it’s quite amusing to hear many of my friends use the same excuse, as they casually stuff an Oreo in their mouth.  In fact, when you’re trying to eat healthy (or follow a diet), I think it’s written somewhere that the #1 excuse or justification is always the “I’ll wait until Monday” approach.\r\n My question is, why?  Why do we put off our lives for “Mondays” or “Next Week” for that matter?  So you ate a piece of cake and are feeling guilty;  instead of then excusing the rest of the week as a “lost cause”, instead focus on your next opportunity to make the right decision.  Just do better your next meal.  Logically if on Wednesday you make a bad food choice or don’t exercise wouldn’t it make more sense to pick up the next meal and do better and exercise the NEXT day and still have a solid week instead of putting off until Monday?  Throwing away Wednesday-Sunday because a slip up on Tuesday or Wednesday isn’t going to get you the results you want.  Why waste away today for tomorrow?  Moreover, many times, when we use the Monday excuse, we then make it “okay” to cheat, or slip into bad habits until that Monday rolls around.  So not only are we holding ourselves back, we’re actually giving ourselves permission to make wrong choices for the rest of the week!\r\n There’s a fact in this new lifestyle.  We’re all imperfect and there will be days that come up that are harder than most (either regarding food or workouts), but instead of sulking and reaching for the tub of Ben & Jerry’s, give yourself credit for doing the best you can each day and try better the next meal instead of putting it off until “next Monday”.  You owe it to yourself to not put off the better you a single day longer than you have to!\r\n To be honest when my husband asked if I was going to write this post I even said, “I’ll get to it Monday”.  Let the irony wash over you on that one.  Good thing my husband gave me that extra nudge I needed.  Do the best you can each and every day.  Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers.  Find the extra support you need to keep you accountable EACH day and if they ever hear you say the words, “I’ll start again on Monday”, give them permission to slap you.  Okay, maybe just remind you.  Unless you’re Drew.  I will always retain that right!"

        "text":"I’ve received quite a few comments on Facebook and Twitter along with many emails from people who are “fearful” after seeing the newest videos/workouts for next week.  There are a few things I want to clarify and outline regarding us all starting some more intensive exercises:\r\n1) Do the best you can- Remember that this is not a contest of you versus me.  It doesn’t matter if you can’t do all the push-ups I can.  I’m showing a guideline for everyone and you should customize it to yourself.  If you need to do all of the push-ups on your knees that’s still great.  Also, you can do push-ups at an angle against the wall as an alternative to doing them on your knees (if that’s too difficult).  Maybe you cannot do as many push-ups as listed on the workout plan… that’s okay too!  Remember, you’re doing the “best” you can and “building your endurance”.  Maybe for the 1st month you can only do half the amount of push-ups on your knees and then the next month all the push-ups on your knees and then the next month half on your knees and half on your feet, etc.  The point is unless you push yourself to do the best you can you’ll never improve.  That’s what I want us to focus on… doing the BEST we can and improving our strength and endurance gradually over time.\r\n 2) Customize to your own situation- As I’ve said before, these plans are customized to my wife and I. We’re trying to give as many options as possible between our two workouts that you can build your workout either from home or the gym.  If you have an injured shoulder or knee (or any other medical condition) that requires you to abstain from an exercise please do so.  You should customize and do what you are able to do and not injure yourself if you have any medical condition or injury.\r\n 3) This is not an excuse to quit- Some have seen there are pull-ups and say “I can’t do a pull-up”.  This is NOT an excuse to quit.  Again, refer to point #1 that you’re doing the best you can.  The pull-ups I do at the gym I use an assisted machine and the ones my wife is doing from home she uses a chair to help her.  I want you to do the best you can with those two options (or choose an alternative exercise if needed).  FEAR IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO QUIT!  Let’s remember that month one we just did stretching and core (along with eating healthy) and still saw results.  So my recommendation is to continue to eat healthy, try out the exercises and use whatever alternatives needed (doing the best you can), and continue to do your stretching.  Whether you can do the exercises 100% or 10% you’ll still continue to improve over time and see results!  Don’t use your exercise fear as an excuse.  Remember…”Commit to a healthier lifestyle, regardless of your circumstances”.\r\n I can’t make a custom plan for everyone, so please use my wife’s workouts (these are not just for women but for people that need to work out from home in general) or my workouts (again these aren’t just for men but anyone that has a gym membership) and do the best you can while maintaining your healthy eating habits.  People fear the unknown and worry about failure.  If you’re doing the best you can you are NEVER failing.  My wife and I will try to post some videos soon showing alternative workouts so people can have more options to choose from as well when making adjustments to the plans listed."

        "text":"This feels different.   After 6 months of reviewing the not so adorable changes to my body (thanks, in part to my personal addictions of Mountain Dew and Cinnamon Toast Crunch), I’m actually reviewing a month with some positive health progress!   However, I would like to take a moment of silence for my dearly departed friends (the aforementioned Dew and Crunch) – I hardly knew you.   And miss you terribly.\r\n …\r\n …\r\n …\r\n Okay, at least my conscious feels a bit better.   With that, it’s the time of the month where I take a look at the physical, emotional, and mental changes I’ve noticed so far, as I finally head back from Fat2Fit.\r\n Physical\r\n 3.5 inches lost in my waist (let’s put it this way – the “permanent” imprint of the elastic waistband of my sweats might not be so permanent after all)\r\n 3 inches lost in my hips (I’ve noticed I’m not knocking as many things over with my huge butt like I used to – oh, I still do…it’s just less)\r\n 19 lbs.  lost in 4 weeks (I guess I won’t have to dress up as Santa this year after all.   But now what am I going to do with the outfit I bought?)\r\n Energy level has increased to a 7 out of 10 (I’ve used “time spent playing with my daughter” as a measuring tool.  I think I’m up to 6 minutes consistently without passing out.   She’s still disappointed.)\r\n I’m happy to report that my chaffing has gone down quite a bit (Sure, it might be TMI, but I’m happier these days because of it!)\r\n I definitely feel less bloated as I used to and my hunger pains aren’t as intense as they were at the start of the month (I’m only half Incredibly Hulk when I’m hungry these days – my wife must be in heaven already!)\r\n Mental\r\n I feel a bit sharper more focused (For example, as I walked into a grocery store I only had to put the Zingers back once instead of a few times because I forgot I was in the Fat2Fit stage).\r\n I’ve only allowed myself to be lazy on football days (that means, I’m only lazy on Saturdays.   And Sundays.   And of course Mondays.   And sometimes Thursdays.   Other than that, my wife, again, must feel spoiled.   I’m so much more helpful!) .\r\n Mentally, the first week of Fat2Fit was hell.   It seemed like I would have run-ins with my favorite friends (Mountain Dew, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Zingers) every day, in every location.   Then again, when I found a liter in the shower, I realized my wife was just punishing me).\r\n Emotional\r\n Yep, I’m still as self-conscious as ever (My fat rolls, although smaller, are still there and my man boobs don’t seem to be ready to abandon the hope of becoming a D-cup).\r\n When I’m stressed and busy, I feel like I still have that emotional attachment to those comfort foods because I know how they taste and I know how they make me feel.\r\n I’ve noticed my complaining has gone down (I’m sure my wife agrees.   I’ll ignore the fact that she’s vehemently shaking her head right now), but we’ll see if that keeps up as I start my exercises next week.\r\n Overall I feel happier, since my energy has increased, and I feel less moody than I did last month (still more head shaking…we’ll just move on!) .\r\n This Month’s “A Ha!”  Moments\r\n Note to self: going without Mountain Dew after 6 straight months of drinking causes massive headaches/grumpiness, and an extended stay on the couch.   Or is that due to the continued snoring?\r\n My co-workers at the hospital decided to order pizza in honor of my Fat2Fit stage.   While it’s the thought that counts, I’ll let you all enjoy that irony!   (Luckily I had my basil chicken with me or I would have caved to the Three P’s – pepperoni and peer pressure).\r\n I was surprised that I was able to control myself during Thanksgiving.   Knowing that I had a green light to “cheat” that meal, I felt pretty good about my decision to stick to my rules.\r\n It’s so much easier not having to cook 2 meals every night like I had to during my Fit2Fat stage.   I’m still wondering how long it will take for my wife and I to fully reassume our pre-journey roles – me as the health nut, and her sneaking in food contraband!)\r\n It helps when I’m in control of buying the groceries because I know I have control of what’s in the house and what’s not in the house.   There will always be moments of weakness at home and having a “snack stash” in the house is just too tempting for me.\r\n Once again, I can’t believe I’ve made it through my first month of Fat2Fit.   Thank you ALL for the support.   It really makes a difference not doing this alone.   Keep pushing through those hard times and those moments of temptation.   Here’s to another great month as we start the exercises.\r\n It’s good I’ve already started returning to my old self.   Less complaining, less whining, less lazy.   Right, honey?\r\n …\r\n …\r\n …\r\n Stop shaking your head!"

        "text":"A3.2\tZoccolo dam (Italy)\r\n A3.2.1\tProject description\r\n Zoccolo dam is located on the Ultimo River which is a tributary in the upper course of the Adige River in the Province Bolzano, Italy.  Construction was completed in 1964.  The dam is a homogeneous earthfill structure consisting of compacted gravelly sands of morainic origin.  The sealing of the earthfill is accomplished by a three-layer asphaltic concrete upstream facing, which is underlain by a thick layer of filter-drainage material.  Seepage control is by a cutoff wall at the heel of the dam and a toe drain at the downstream foot, together with a row of six relief wells.  A filter blanket on the upstream face of the toe drain and below it prevents the loss of fines from the foundation.  Water passing through the impervious face into the filter zone is conveyed to a manifold in the heel gallery by means of pipes provided with valves.  A layout of the embankment is shown in Fig. 1 and a section in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n The main characteristics of the dam are:\r\n•\tMaximum height: 66.5 m\r\n •\tCrest elevation 1144.50 m asl\r\n •\tCrest length: 516 m\r\n •\tEarth fill volume: 1.4x106 m3\r\n\r\n A3.2.2\tFoundation conditions\r\n The bedrock in the area of the dam site is lying at a depth in excess of 100 m.  It consists of mica-schists, phyllites and paragneiss.  The right wing of the embankment is founded on a morainic mound (compression wave velocity, vP = 1900m/s and hydraulic conductivity k=10-1 to 10-3 cm/s), which is covered by a relatively thin layer of slope talus.  On the left bank, the first 40 to 50 m consist of outwash materials (vP = 1350 m/s) followed by fluvio-glacial deposits (actually a remolded and sluiced moraine).  In the river bed there are a few layers of lacustrine silt interbedded with alluvial materials.  These deposits thin out towards downstream until they practically disappear just downstream of the dam axis.  Fig. 3 shows a geological section through the foundation materials.\r\n\r\n A3.2.3\tFoundation treatment\r\n The main element to control seepage is a concrete wall consisting of alternating circular and bi-concave piles.  This system is normally known under the name of I.C.O.S. piling system (see Section 5.8.1).  The pile diameter, and thus the thickness of the wall, was 0.60 m.  The depth of the piles varied between 45 and 55 m but nowhere did they reach the bedrock.  The choice of an I.C.O.S. type pile wall, i.e. continuous concrete piling, was based on several technical and economic considerations, corroborated by in-situ and model tests.  Other sealing methods considered were an upstream blanket and a vertical grout curtain.  The upstream blanket was abandoned because of difficulties in connecting it with the silt layers in the alluvial deposits next to the dam.  The silt layers were sensitive being under artesian pressure and any disturbance could have triggered liquefaction phenomena.  Alluvial grouting was considered to be of little efficacy because of the presence of silt in some parts of the granular material which would inhibit the penetration of the grout.\r\n\r\n Fig. 1 Zoccolo dam: Layout of embankment and apurtenances\r\n\r\n Fig. 2 Zoccolo dam: Maximum section\r\n (a)\tmoraine\r\n (b)\talluvial\r\n (c)\ttalus\t(d)\tfan outwash\r\n (e)\tfluvio-glacial\r\n (f)\tbedrock\r\n\r\n Fig. 3 Geological section along dam axis\r\n The I.C.O.S. wall follows in plan the heel of the embankment with the elevation of its top remaining more or less constant in the central part of the valley and raising on the abutments.  The wall is reinforced at the top over a variable depth of 2.7m to 7.3 m, with six vertical bars (Ø 20 mm) on the interlocking secondary elements and only with construction dowels in the primary elements.  The reinforcement was needed to connect the wall to an inspection gallery that followed the wall along the heel of the dam.  Construction of the pile wall started in 1961 and was completed, after 36 months, during the summer of 1964.  Thirteen drilling machines were used to execute this job.  The ground contained boulders with a diameter of up to 2.7 m.  There entire wall consists of about 1100 pile elements making up a barrier of 33,100 m2 in area.  The price for 1 m2 of wall during the period 1961/64 came to about 70 US$.  Before awarding the piling job the owner decided to construct, on the right bank close to the heel of the dam a test pit of polygonal shape, 1.85 m inside diameter, and 38 m deep.  The wall consisted of eight primary and eight secondary elements reaching to a depth of 45 m.  The water table was at a depth of 22 m.  The wall turned out to be perfectly watertight under this hydraulic head and piles did not show any cracks.\r\n\r\n In order to estimate the hydraulic gradients that would exist during operation of the dam, model tests were carried out which demonstrated that in no case these hydraulic gradients would approach those critical for a 50 m deep cutoff.  Seepage loss from the soil below the cutoff was estimated to range between a few hundred liters per second to 0.5 m3/s.\r\n\r\n A3.2.4\t Wall construction\r\n Primary piles have a center to center spacing of 1.20 m.  They serve as guides for the secondary piles.  The principle of construction is described in Section A3.1.\r\n\r\n The concrete used for the piles at the Zoccolo dam site had the following mix proportions:\r\n•\tMax grain size 35 mm\r\n •\tCement 300 kg/m3\r\n •\tWater/cement ratio, w/c ~ 0.8\r\n •\tAdditive: Plasticizer\r\n\r\n Bentonite consumption was about 280 kg per m2 of wall.  This corresponds to about 2 m3 of slurry.  A good proportion of the bentonite stayed in the ground as a result of penetration into the alluvium adding an additional barrier to the flow of water.\r\n\r\n A3.2.5\t Connection of wall to impervious upstream facing\r\n The connection of the pile wall with the upstream impervious face was accomplished by means of a head gallery, as shown in Fig. 4.  This gallery also collects the drainage water from the filter layer below the impervious facing.  The idea was to separate completely the gallery and the pile wall such they can move independently under the imposed water load and the earth pressure.  The gallery was expected to move downwards relative to the cutoff wall and to tilt towards the downstream side.\r\n\r\n The connection between wall and gallery was accomplished in stages such that displacements could take place before the gap between wall and the gallery floor was fully sealed.  Geodetic points were installed on the gallery walls and on the top of the pile wall.  These points were connected to an exterior triangulation net through a gallery leading to the toe outlet of the embankment.  PVC water stops sealed the gap between gallery walls and the pile wall head when the first trial impounding with about 20 m of water head was started.  The water stop was overlain by a neoprene mastic that adhered to the gallery wall providing an additional line of defense.  Differential movement of gallery and pile wall occurred and it was decided to close the gallery floor by pouring slabs of reinforced concrete in a checkerboard pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n (a)\tasphaltic facing\r\n (b)\tInside of gallery\r\n (c)\tCement grouted zone\r\n (d)\tCement and bentonite grouted zone\r\n (e)\tBentonite and penetrated zone\t(f)\tPrimary pile\r\n (g)\tSecondary pile\r\n (h)\tConcrete\r\n (i)\tNeoprene mastic\r\n (j)\tPVC water stop\r\n (k)\tGrouted zone\r\n (l)\tInjection pipe\r\n Fig. 4 Gallery structure along the heel of the dam\r\n The second trial impounding nearly reached the normal storage level and further movements of gallery and pile wall took place.  The missing reinforced concrete slabs were then poured and the space between the floor of the gallery and the top of the pile grouted.\r\n\r\n A3.2.6\tPerformance\r\n Deformations\r\n Gallery and pile wall continued to settle up to the fourth cycle of impounding when the full storage level of 1141 m asl was reached.  The gallery settled about 6 to 7 cm, depending on the location, and the wall about 5 cm.  The horizontal movements in downstream direction amounted to 8 to 12 cm for the galley and 6 to 12 cm for the pile wall.  In addition there was also a slight rotation of the gallery.\r\n\r\n Seepage and leakage\r\n The pore water pressures around the cutoff wall were measured by means of standpipes embedded in the piles or along the walls of wells built adherent to the pile cutoff.  Under normal storage level of 1141 m asl the water level downstream of the cutoff was at about 1080 m asl, i.e. about one meter below the ground surface at the dam toe.  Seepage developed from flow under the cutoff wall and from flow around the dam in the abutments.\r\n\r\n Leakage was monitored at two points, one at the toe of the dam in the river bed collecting the water from the filter and the relief wells and the other 250 m downstream collecting also the water from drainage pipes in the abutments downstream of the dam.  Under maximum storage conditions the total leakage was measured initially as around 450 l/s.  This value decreased to about 350 l/s one year after the first full impounding.  The content of fine solids in the leakage water was lower than 0.1 g/liter and considerably less than that of the reservoir water.\r\n\r\n However, during the course of operation, leakage from the filter layer below the asphaltic face increased and the position of the phreatic line next to the upstream face moved upwards.  Based on investigations this was attributed to a deterioration of the upper part of the diaphragm wall.  Repair works were carried out in 1976/1977 and consisted mainly in the construction of a two-row grout curtain with 25 m and 15 m deep holes spaced at 1m, immediately upstream of the diaphragm wall and along its entire length.  After refilling the reservoir, the position of the phreatic line was lower again and has remained more or less stationary ever since.

        "text":"He let her, and she took another seat.  Then he followed.\r\n\r\n \"Don't run away from me, Carrie,\" he said gently.  \"Let me explain.  If you will only hear me out you will see where I stand.  I tell you my wife is nothing to me.  She hasn't been anything for years or I wouldn't have ever come near you.  I'm going to get a divorce just as soon as I can.  I'll never see her again.  I'm done with all that.  You're the only person I want.  If I can have you I won't ever think of another woman again.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state.  It sounded sincere enough, however, despite all he had done.  There was a tenseness in Hurstwood's voice and manner which could but have some effect.  She did not want anything to do with him.  He was married, he had deceived her once, and now again, and she thought him terrible.  Still there is something in such daring and power which is fascinating to a woman, especially if she can be made to feel that it is all prompted by love of her.\r\n\r\n The progress of the train was having a great deal to do with the solution of this difficult situation.  The speeding wheels and disappearing country put Chicago farther and farther behind.  Carrie could feel that she was being borne a long distance off— that the engine was making an almost through run to some distant city.  She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid;  at other times it seemed an almost useless thing—so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did.  All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him.\r\n\r\n \"I was simply put where I didn't know what else to do.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this.\r\n\r\n \"When I say you wouldn't come unless I could marry you, I decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me.  I'm going off now to another city.  I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to.  We'll go and live in New York, if you say.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'll not have anything to do with you,\" said Carrie.  \"I want to get off this train.  Where are we going?\"\r\n\r\n \"To Detroit,\" said Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n \"Oh!\"  said Carrie, in a burst of anguish.  So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty.\r\n\r\n \"Won't you come along with me?\"  he said, as if there was great danger that she would not.  \"You won't need to do anything but travel with me.  I'll not trouble you in any way.  You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don't want to stay you can go back.  It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\"\r\n\r\n The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie.  It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out.  Montreal and New York!  Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked.  She thought, but made no sign.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this.  He redoubled his ardour.\r\n\r\n \"Think,\" he said, \"what I've given up.  I can't go back to Chicago any more.  I've got to stay away and live alone now, if you don't come with me.  You won't go back on me entirely, will you, Carrie?\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't want you to talk to me,\" she answered forcibly.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood kept silent for a while.\r\n\r\n Carrie felt the train to be slowing down.  It was the moment to act if she was to act at all.  She stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n \"Don't think of going, Carrie,\" he said.  \"If you ever cared for me at all, come along and let's start right.  I'll do whatever you say.  I'll marry you, or I'll let you go back.  Give yourself time to think it over.  I wouldn't have wanted you to come if I hadn't loved you.  I tell you, Carrie, before God, I can't live without you.  I won't!\"\r\n\r\n There was the tensity of fierceness in the man's plea which appealed deeply to her sympathies.  It was a dissolving fire which was actuating him now.  He was loving her too intensely to think of giving her up in this, his hour of distress.  He clutched her hand nervously and pressed it with all the force of an appeal.\r\n\r\n The train was now all but stopped.  It was running by some cars on a side track.  Everything outside was dark and dreary.  A few sprinkles on the window began to indicate that it was raining.  Carrie hung in a quandary, balancing between decision and helplessness.  Now the train stopped, and she was listening to his plea.  The engine backed a few feet and all was still.\r\n\r\n She wavered, totally unable to make a move.  Minute after minute slipped by and still she hesitated, he pleading.\r\n\r\n \"Will you let me come back if I want to?\"  she asked, as if she now had the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued.\r\n\r\n \"Of course,\" he answered, \"you know I will.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty.  She began to feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely.\r\n\r\n The train was again in rapid motion.  Hurstwood changed the subject.\r\n\r\n \"Aren't you very tired?\"  he said.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n \"Won't you let me get you a berth in the sleeper?\"\r\n\r\n She shook her head, though for all her distress and his trickery she was beginning to notice what she had always felt—his thoughtfulness.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"you will feel so much better.\"\r\n\r\n She shook her head.\r\n\r\n \"Let me fix my coat for you, anyway,\" and he arose and arranged his light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head.\r\n\r\n \"There,\" he said tenderly, \"now see if you can't rest a little.\"  He could have kissed her for her compliance.  He took his seat beside her and thought a moment.\r\n\r\n \"I believe we're in for a heavy rain,\" he said.\r\n\r\n \"So it looks,\" said Carrie, whose nerves were quieting under the sound of the rain drops, driven by a gusty wind, as the train swept on frantically through the shadow to a newer world.\r\n\r\n The fact that he had in a measure mollified Carrie was a source of satisfaction to Hurstwood, but it furnished only the most temporary relief.  Now that her opposition was out of the way, he had all of his time to devote to the consideration of his own error.\r\n\r\n His condition was bitter in the extreme, for he did not want the miserable sum he had stolen.  He did not want to be a thief.  That sum or any other could never compensate for the state which he had thus foolishly doffed.  It could not give him back his host of friends, his name, his house and family, nor Carrie, as he had meant to have her.  He was shut out from Chicago—from his easy, comfortable state.  He had robbed himself of his dignity, his merry meetings, his pleasant evenings.  And for what?  The more he thought of it the more unbearable it became.  He began to think that he would try and restore himself to his old state.  He would return the miserable thievings of the night and explain.  Perhaps Moy would understand.  Perhaps they would forgive him and let him come back.\r\n\r\n By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feel exceedingly nervous.  The police must be on his track by now.  They had probably notified all the police of the big cities, and detectives would be watching for him.  He remembered instances in which defaulters had been captured.  Consequently, he breathed heavily and paled somewhat.  His hands felt as if they must have something to do.  He simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel.  He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor.\r\n\r\n Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing.  She had no idea what it meant or that it was important.\r\n\r\n He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point.  Perhaps he could have saved time.  He jumped up and sought the conductor.\r\n\r\n \"Does any part of this train go to Montreal?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, the next sleeper back does.\"\r\n\r\n He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot.\r\n\r\n The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing.\r\n\r\n \"I think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\" he said to Carrie.  \"I'll see what the connections are when we get off.\"\r\n\r\n He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior.  Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes.  She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do.\r\n\r\n The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out.  He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie.  Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office.\r\n\r\n \"The next train for Montreal leaves when?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"In twenty minutes,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n He bought two tickets and Pullman berths.  Then he hastened back to Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"We go right out again,\" he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary.\r\n\r\n \"I wish I was out of all this,\" she exclaimed gloomily.\r\n\r\n \"You'll feel better when we reach Montreal,\" he said.\r\n\r\n \"I haven't an earthly thing with me,\" said Carrie;  \"not even a handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n \"You can buy all you want as soon as you get there, dearest,\" he explained.  \"You can call in a dressmaker.\"\r\n\r\n Now the crier called the train ready and they got on.  Hurstwood breathed a sigh of relief as it started.  There was a short run to the river, and there they were ferried over.  They had barely pulled the train off the ferry-boat when he settled back with a sigh.\r\n\r\n \"It won't be so very long now,\" he said, remembering her in his relief.  \"We get there the first thing in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie scarcely deigned to reply.\r\n\r\n \"I'll see if there is a dining-car,\" he added.  \"I'm hungry.\" \r\n\r\n Chapter XXIX\r\n\r\n THE SOLACE OF TRAVEL—THE BOATS OF THE SEA\r\n\r\n To the untravelled, territory other than their own familiar heath is invariably fascinating.  Next to love, it is the one thing which solaces and delights.  Things new are too important to be neglected, and mind, which is a mere reflection of sensory impressions, succumbs to the flood of objects.  Thus lovers are forgotten, sorrows laid aside, death hidden from view.  There is a world of accumulated feeling back of the trite dramatic expression—\"I am going away.\"\r\n\r\n As Carrie looked out upon the flying scenery she almost forgot that she had been tricked into this long journey against her will and that she was without the necessary apparel for travelling.  She quite forgot Hurstwood's presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes.  It was an interesting world to her.  Her life had just begun.  She did not feel herself defeated at all.  Neither was she blasted in hope.  The great city held much. "

        "text":"Writers sometimes develop poor habits, and end up doing more thinking about writing than actual writing.  I know, because although I write for a living, and I still don't always spend enough time on the writing that I most want to do.  And for those people who aren't writers by trade, but need or want to write for professional or business reasons, then you may need a little help developing your writing habit.\r\n\r\n The following simple steps can help you write more often and with better results.\r\n\r\n 1.  Write Every Day\r\n\r\n Developing a habit means doing something regularly.  Therefore you should do your best to find time to write every day.  It doesn't have to be a long period of time, even fifteen minutes will do if that's all you can spare.  The key is to practice every day!\r\n\r\n 2.  Set Manageable Writing Goals\r\n\r\n Books are written one sentence at a time, so don't fall into the trap of only sitting down to write when you have several hours at a time to devote to your work.  Even if you only have time to put down a paragraph, that's progress.\r\n\r\n 3.  Don't Stress About Writing\r\n\r\n When you over-think your writing projects, they can seem bigger and more important . . .  and much more intimidating than they really should be.  Just sit down and write;  don't make a big deal out of it.  The true beauty of a manuscript doesn't appear until a few revisions, anyways.  Just put your words on paper.\r\n\r\n 4.  When You're Writing, Write Without Your Inner Critic\r\n\r\n Another part of letting loose and approaching writing with confidence is allowing yourself to write terrible sentences and paragraphs just to put something on the page and get through blocks.  Don't rework sentences until you've completed an entire draft-it will only slow you down and make writing more difficult.\r\n\r\n 5.  Get Feedback on Your Writing\r\n\r\n At some point, you have to start sharing what you're working on with people who can provide encouragement and insight into how to improve.  Try to aim for a balance of supporters, like best friends and parents, with professional opinions, which won't always be as easy to swallow as a big cheer from mom.\r\n\r\n Anyone who wants to write can do it.  Discipline is the key, and catching the writing habit doesn't hurt, either.  With these tips, you can write better and faster than you ever imagined\r\n"

        "text":"China and America in South-East Asia\r\n Dance of the giants\r\n\r\n THE spectre looming over Barack Obama’s eight-day swing through Asia was unmistakable.  Behind the talk of a trans-Pacific free-trade zone, and the agreement to rotate American troops through a base in northern Australia, and America’s first participation in the East Asian Summit meeting in Bali, the president’s tour was all about China.\r\n\r\n As if to mark the end of a decade in which a rising China was superseded by radical Islam as America’s biggest potential security threat, Mr Obama is now recalibrating his foreign-policy machinery and focusing on the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\n The government in Beijing has used some of the past decade’s worth of breathing-space shrewdly, launching a charm offensive in South-East Asia, building hospitals, roads and schools, and becoming the largest trading partner of many of the region’s countries while America whistled a lonesome, security-obsessed tune.  But in the past couple of years, occasional rumbles of thunder out of China — especially on the subject of the South China Sea — have sent South-East Asian governments rushing for the shelter of the American umbrella.\r\n\r\n The Obama administration had signalled clearly that its policy shift was coming, but there was still plenty of fulminating about “containment” from China’s increasingly nationalistic news outlets.  The loudmouths of Beijing can easily match their bloviating counterparts at America’s Fox News huff for puff these days, and not just towards the United States.  The infamously belligerent Global Times warned Australia that it “could not play China for a fool” in agreeing to allow American troops to be based in its northern city of Darwin.  One thing is certain, said the newspaper on November 16th: “if Australia uses its military bases to help the U.S. harm Chinese interests, then Australia itself will be caught in the crossfire.”\r\n\r\n But China’s relatively avuncular premier Wen Jiabao has snorkelled this reef before.  As he arrived for the regional forum known as the East Asian Summit in Bali, he took a hard line, saying that “outside forces should not, under any pretext” interfere in a regional dispute over the control of the South China Sea.  Mr Wen may have listened warily as Mr Obama announced further rapprochement with Myanmar, including plans for a visit in December by his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.  Myanmar has, over the past 20 years, developed an extremely close relationship with China, and yet here again was a case of America reasserting its influence in the region.  Indeed, it could be taken as confirmation that South-East Asia is a potential crucible for future confrontations between America and China.\r\n\r\n And yet Mr Wen managed, almost, to charm as well.  An American official briefing reporters as Mr Obama flew home aboard Air Force One said that on November 19th, during a two-hour session, 16 of the 18 leaders present raised concerns about maritime security directly with Mr Wen.  The official Chinese news agency reported Mr Wen as saying he did not want to discuss the issue at the summit, but adding that it would be “impolite” not to answer a neighbour’s questions.  So he defended China’s stance on the South China Sea.\r\n\r\n Though the same American official told the New York Times that Mr Wen’s response was “grouchy” at times, he acknowledged that at least the Chinese premier was “not on a tirade”, nor did he use many of the more assertive formulas that are frequently heard from the Chinese.  In the American’s judgment the overall discussion was “constructive, and not acrimonious”.  China’s leaders clearly feel that, for now at least, discretion is the better part of grouchiness.\r\n\r\n Chinese academics too — an increasingly independent bunch, who have become comfortable discussing international issues candidly with foreign reporters — are at pains to play down whatever threat China might feel posed by America’s latest moves.\r\n\r\n “Many of us believe that what America is doing is somewhere between engagement and hedging, but not containment,” says Jin Canrong of Renmin University in Beijing.  Mr Jin says that China’s comportment with America is much more mature than it used to be and notes that the two sides enjoy much better channels of communication than they had.\r\n\r\n “Chinese belligerence on the South China Sea is mainly for domestic reasons,” agrees Pang Zhongying, also of Renmin University — a bold statement considering how much the Chinese belligerence is shaking up the Asia-Pacific.  Mr Pang admits that “domestic pressures could lead to a misjudgement by Chinese leaders.”  China is no democracy, but its leaders still have powerful domestic constituencies in the media and the army, as well as among the general public, and must be careful not to come across as weak.  At the same time they have plenty of work ahead if they are to convince their neighbours and America that their rise can continue to be peaceful.\r\n\r\n Mr Jin says he can understand why people might be nervous about China’s rise.  But he insists that instances like the one in March 2010, when Chinese officials sparked concern in Washington by telling senior American officials that the South China Sea was part of China’s “core interests” (on a par with Taiwan), are simply part of a process by which China is trying to settle on its own foreign policy.  “We are in the middle of an internal debate,” says Mr Jin, “and the result has not been decided.”  Looking at the rapid growth of China’s military forces and the country’s increased forcefulness in the world arena generally, America might find it hard to believe that the debate remains undecided.  Meanwhile, Mr Wen and his colleagues will continue to try balancing tough talk with engagement, a challenge not unlike the one facing Mr Obama.  With an American presidential election due in November 2012, and a leadership transition in China at about the same time, these will prove tricky waters to navigate for both sides in the year to come.\r\n\r\n It has always been more difficult for the rising power to persuade the incumbent power that its intentions are benign.  On November 19th the China’s official news agency, Xinhua, published a commentary arguing that if the United States sticks to its cold-war mentality and continues to engage with Asian nations in a self-assertive way, “it is doomed to incur repulsion in the region”.  Xinhua’s assessment, it so happens, might be even more aptly applied to China.\r\n"

        "text":"I love to exercise, not in a gym, but in fiction writing.  Since I'll be exercising, I'll start stretching with a few beginnings.\r\n\r\n Nobody knows more about the importance of beginnings than fiction writers, because the beginning of any narrative is the part that hooks the reader from the start.  Not each beginning is suitable for any one piece, and some beginnings become passé after decades of overuse;  nevertheless, it is a good idea to take a look at the few types of beginnings used in fiction.\r\n\r\n At this time, applying the same storyline, I'd like to write a few exercises.  Each exercise will be for a different type of a beginning.\r\n\r\n Check out Archetype's idea generators to find prompts for\r\n\r\n Characters\r\n\r\n Plots\r\n\r\n Everyday problems\r\n (story starter conflicts)\r\n\r\n Beginning with the setting:\r\n\r\n  The city of Bern snuggles into a U shaped arm of the river Aare, extending its reach to the other sides by historical bridges and railways.  Surrounded by densely wooded areas and mountains, Bern is not a crowded city, except for tourists.  At 1800 feet altitude, as the highlight of the Bernese-Oberland region, the city ticks to the tune of a modern civilization, although still cuddling its centuries-old astronomical clock tower at the east gate right around the marketplace where one can buy Swiss goods at a much lower price than at the imported price anywhere else.\r\n Beginning by inserting characters into the setting:\r\n\r\n  At the east gate of the city of Bern in the marketplace in a tidy corner, Rodolphe's magasin de chocolat or Schokolade Speicher sits facing the setting sun, and across, Mireille's Spielzeugspeicher boasts with all sizes of plush baby bears at its window.  Rodolphe sees those brown and gray plush toys with a wary eye.  He knows from behind that window, Mireille's husband Karl is watching his every move.\r\n Beginning with the thematic way, which is with a truism, a generalization, or a philosophical idea:\r\n\r\n  Our greatest deeds we do unknowingly.  Like love.  Most of us fall in love unknowingly, and that is what exactly happened to Rodolphe in his chocolate store while he watched the plush toy bears from across the street and wondered if Mireille, the owner of the teddy bear store, was as cute and cuddly in bed.\r\n Beginning the factual way;  that is, a realistic no-nonsense opening derived from real events:\r\n\r\n  In 1879, Rodolphe Lindt of Berne, Switzerland, produced chocolate that melted on the tongue, creating the fondant.  Two centuries later in the same city, his namesake Rodolphe sat in his Schokolade Speicher that faced Mireille's toy store, his neighbor across the street.  As he rolled a soft sweet fondant in his mouth, Rodolphe thought of Mireille, her thin waist, her large green eyes, her overly made-up face, her cadenced walk, and her syrupy smile.\r\n Considered to be the most successful by some, beginning through the emotional way, which is aiming for the heart and appealing directly to the reader's emotions:\r\n\r\n  In the middle of the street in Berne's marketplace, a jealous Karl shot the unsuspecting Rodolphe with a hunting rifle as his traumatized wife Mireille ran about screaming.  Rodolphe, the chocolatier, had the reputation of a saint to young and old alike;  however, for Karl, Rodolphe was a scorpion who knelt in prayer while raising its tail to kill.\r\n Beginning with action, that is, starting with any significant movement:\r\n\r\n  Rodolphe, the chocolatier, cocked his head quizzically.  Karl, his neighbor, was aiming at him with a rifle.  \"No!\"  With the sudden blast of the rifle, Rodolphe dropped to his knees, blotting his damp, chocolate-covered hands on his denim jeans.  As Rodolphe's body grew stiff, Mireille ran screaming toward the two men, but she too fell down like a folded cloth and heard nothing else except for the throbbing of the street to the thick, fast beat of her heart.\r\n A medias res (in the middle of things) beginning, which has been in favor during the recent years:\r\n\r\n  The blast from Karl's rifle brought Rodolphe to his knees.  As his blood created puddles on the cobblestone street, the last sound he heard was Mireille's screams before he grew stiff and senseless.\r\n Beginning with a dialogue: (Most readers respond to dialogue well, especially if they sense tension or foreshadowing in it.)\r\n\r\n \"Karl is screwed up,\" Mireille said.  \"This is going to be difficult.  Are you sure you want to go ahead with this give and take?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" Rodolphe nodded.  \"You need my fondants.  I'm like moonlight on dark water for you.\"  Then, he looked away.  \"Are you still in shock from last night?\"\r\n\r\n \"It was routine,\" Mireille shrugged, arranging her plush bears in the window in irregular rows.  \"Karl always gets like that.  He is just jealous.  It isn't everyday that he sees me eating expensive fondants.\"\r\n Beginning with a character's description:\r\n\r\n  Rodolphe wiggled on the red leather-cushioned stool near the window of his chocolate store, watching the street and Mireille's plush bears, because even at his age, he was still deeply interested in toys.  Tall, fat, and ugly with a crooked nose and misshapen smile, Rodolphe was also generous and jolly, except when he espied Karl putting his arms around Mireille.  Then, Rodolphe's face pinched with pain and his mouth drew downwards, trembling.  Still, all this was before Karl shot him and Rodolphe was pronounced dead by Mireille, though only for a short time.  Afterwards, when the medics brought him to life, Rodolphe's outlook changed.\r\n Beginning with the author's voice addressing the reader: Although this method of beginning can be appealing, confidential-sounding, and even effective, it is considered old fashioned and boring.  Speaking for me, I hate it, but here it is anyway.\r\n\r\n If memory were a movie, dear reader, you would see the marketplace in Berne from above, and in a close-up you would see me, Joy Cagil—the author here, strolling in front of a chocolate store thinking of this poignant and funny story, since a tiny part of my life was spent in Berne.  Then, you would have to take my word that in this very store, Rodolphe offered his delectable fondants to Mireille because he felt sorry for the plush bear that Karl, Mireille's husband, had ripped apart.\r\n Diary, epistolary (letter-writing), or reflective beginning:\r\n\r\n  Dear Mireille,\r\n\r\n  What would you say if you knew I have your diary?\r\n\r\n Yes, my dear one, yesterday, when I brought you the fondants, I couldn't help myself to pick it up when I saw the diary near your cash register.  At that moment, you had your back turned to me, for you were putting a teddy back on the shelf, which you had knocked down when you saw me enter.  I took your diary like a common thief and put it under my vest.\r\n\r\n Am I sorry?  No, believe me;  I am not, although this is not a gentlemanly act.  In fact, I am deliriously happy.\r\n\r\n I took your diary because I was curious about what went inside your pretty head, but oh what joy, I found out that you had feelings for me.\r\n\r\n Is it the chocolate that affects women to melt like cream over fire?  Maybe, since I am never sure of my manly charms.  But that doesn't matter now, for you have given me a new life and a new brown plush teddy bear for my counter that I will cherish forever and ever.\r\n\r\n I am returning your diary so you can write more about me.\r\n\r\n Rodolphe\r\n Beginning by asking a question:\r\n\r\n  Where was Mireille?  Spielzeugspeicher's doors were still locked;  although it was far later than the usual hour Mireille opened her shop.  Had Karl hurt her feelings again by throwing out the fondants in the trash?  Or worse yet, at this very moment, was Mireille being forced into Karl's brusque embrace?  Rodolphe tapped on the counter with his plumb fingers as he sat wiggling uneasily on the red leather-cushioned stool.\r\n\r\n I had a lot of fun playing with these exercises, and you, too, have fun with a few beginnings of your own.  Who knows, you may end up with a great beginning that will hold the attention of even the most reluctant reader."

        "text":"Financing international trade\r\n\r\n Documentary credits\r\n\r\n A company which sells goods or services to other countries is known as an exporter.  A company which buys products from other countries is called an importer.  Payment for imported products is usually by documentary credit, also called a letter of credit.  This is a written promise by a bank to pay a certain amount to the seller, within a fixed period, when the bank receives instructions from the buyer.  Documentary credits have a standard form.  They generally contain:\r\n■\ta short description of the goods\r\n ■\ta list of shipping documents required to obtain payment (see С below)\r\n ■\ta final shipping date\r\n ■\ta final date (or expiration date) for presenting the documents to the bank. \r\n\r\n Documentary credits are usually irrevocable, meaning that they cannot be changed unless all the parties involved agree.  Irrevocable credits guarantee that the bank which establishes the letter of credit will pay the seller if the documents are presented within the agreed rime.\r\n\r\n Bills of exchange\r\n\r\n Another method of payment is a bill of exchange or draft.  This is a payment demand, written or drawn up by an exporter, instructing an importer to pay a specific sum of money at a future date.  When the bill matures, the importer pays the money to its bank, which transfers the money to the exporter's bank.  This bank then pays the money to the exporter after deducting its charges.\r\n A bank may agree to endorse or accept a bill of exchange before it matures.  To endorse a bill is to guarantee to pay it if the buyer of goods does not.  If a bill is endorsed by a well- known bank, the exporter can sell it at a discount in the financial markets.  The discount represents the interest the buyer of the bill could have earned between the date of purchase and the bill's maturity date.  When the bill matures, the buyer receives the full amount.  This way the exporter gets most of the money immediately, and doesn't have to wait for the buyer to pay the bill.\r\n\r\n Export documents\r\n\r\n Importers have to prepare a number of documents to go with the shipment or transportation of goods.\r\n ■ The commercial invoice contains details of the goods: quantity, weight, number of packages, price, terms of delivery, terms of payment, and information about the transportation.\r\n ■ The bill of lading is a document signed by the carrier or transporter (e.g. the ship's master) confirming that the goods have been received for shipment;  it contains a brief description of the goods and details of where they are going.\r\n ■ The insurance certificate also describes the goods and contains details of how to claim if they are lost or damaged in transit - while being transported.\r\n ■ The certificate of origin states where the goods come from.\r\n ■ Quality and weight certificates, issued by private inspection and testing companies, may be necessary, confirming that these are the correct goods in the right quantity.\r\n ■ An export licence giving rhe right to sell particular goods abroad is necessary in some cases.\r\n"

        "text":"Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom—who knows?  Perhaps she would be happy.  These thoughts raised her above the level of erring.  She was saved in that she was hopeful.\r\n\r\n The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city.  Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped.  As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman.\r\n\r\n \"We'll go right up and get rooms,\" he said.\r\n\r\n At the clerk's office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward.  He was thinking what name he would put down.  With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation.  A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him.  It was pleasing enough.  With an easy hand he wrote, \"G.  W. Murdock and wife.\"  It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making.  His initials he could not spare.\r\n\r\n When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured her a lovely chamber.\r\n\r\n \"You have a bath there,\" said he.  \"Now you can clean up when you get ready.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie went over and looked out the window, while Hurstwood looked at himself in the glass.  He felt dusty and unclean.  He had no trunk, no change of linen, not even a hair-brush.\r\n\r\n \"I'll ring for soap and towels,\" he said, \"and send you up a hair-brush.  Then you can bathe and get ready for breakfast.  I'll go for a shave and come back and get you, and then we'll go out and look for some clothes for you.\"\r\n\r\n He smiled good-naturedly as he said this.\r\n\r\n \"All right,\" said Carrie.\r\n\r\n She sat down in one of the rocking-chairs, while Hurstwood waited for the boy, who soon knocked.\r\n\r\n \"Soap, towels, and a pitcher of ice-water.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'll go now,\" he said to Carrie, coming toward her and holding out his hands, but she did not move to take them.\r\n\r\n \"You're not mad at me, are you?\"  he asked softly.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, no!\"  she answered, rather indifferently.\r\n\r\n \"Don't you care for me at all?\"\r\n\r\n She made no answer, but looked steadily toward the window.\r\n\r\n \"Don't you think you could love me a little?\"  he pleaded, taking one of her hands, which she endeavoured to draw away.  \"You once said you did.\"\r\n\r\n \"What made you deceive me so?\"  asked Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"I couldn't help it,\" he said, \"I wanted you too much.\"\r\n\r\n \"You didn't have any right to want me,\" she answered, striking cleanly home.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, well, Carrie,\" he answered, \"here I am.  It's too late now.  Won't you try and care for me a little?\"\r\n\r\n He looked rather worsted in thought as he stood before her.\r\n\r\n She shook her head negatively.\r\n\r\n \"Let me start all over again.  Be my wife from to-day on.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie rose up as if to step away, he holding her hand.  Now he slipped his arm about her and she struggled, but in vain.  He held her quite close.  Instantly there flamed up in his body the all compelling desire.  His affection took an ardent form.\r\n\r\n \"Let me go,\" said Carrie, who was folded close to him.\r\n\r\n \"Won't you love me?\"  he said.  \"Won't you be mine from now on?\"\r\n\r\n Carrie had never been ill-disposed toward him.  Only a moment before she had been listening with some complacency, remembering her old affection for him.  He was so handsome, so daring!\r\n\r\n Now, however, this feeling had changed to one of opposition, which rose feebly.  It mastered her for a moment, and then, held close as she was, began to wane.  Something else in her spoke.  This man, to whose bosom she was being pressed, was strong;  he was passionate, he loved her, and she was alone.  If she did not turn to him—accept of his love—where else might she go?  Her resistance half dissolved in the flood of his strong feeling.\r\n\r\n She found him lifting her head and looking into her eyes.  What magnetism there was she could never know.  His many sins, however, were for the moment all forgotten.\r\n\r\n He pressed her closer and kissed her, and she felt that further opposition was useless.\r\n\r\n \"Will you marry me?\"  she asked, forgetting how.\r\n\r\n \"This very day,\" he said, with all delight.\r\n\r\n Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her regretfully.\r\n\r\n \"You get ready now, will you,\" he said, \"at once?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n \"I'll be back in three-quarters of an hour.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy.\r\n\r\n Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop.  For the moment, he was in fine feather.  His recent victory over Carrie seemed to atone for much he had endured during the last few days.  Life seemed worth fighting for.  This eastward flight from all things customary and attached seemed as if it might have happiness in store.  The storm showed a rainbow at the end of which might be a pot of gold.\r\n\r\n He was about to cross to a little red-and-white striped bar which was fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted him familiarly.  Instantly his heart sank.  \"Why, hello, George, old man!\"  said the voice.  \"What are you doing down here?\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood was already confronted, and recognised his friend Kenny, the stock-broker.\r\n\r\n \"Just attending to a little private matter,\" he answered, his mind working like a key-board of a telephone station.  This man evidently did not know—he had not read the papers.\r\n\r\n \"Well, it seems strange to see you way up here,\" said Mr. Kenny genially.  \"Stopping here?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said Hurstwood uneasily, thinking of his handwriting on the register.\r\n\r\n \"Going to be in town long?\"\r\n\r\n \"No, only a day or so.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is that so?  Had your breakfast?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said Hurstwood, lying blandly.  \"I'm just going for a shave.\"\r\n\r\n \"Won't you come have a drink?\"\r\n\r\n \"Not until afterwards,\" said the ex-manager.  \"I'll see you later.  Are you stopping here?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added: \"How are things out in Chicago?\"\r\n\r\n \"About the same as usual,\" said Hurstwood, smiling genially.\r\n\r\n \"Wife with you?\"\r\n\r\n \"No.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, I must see more of you to-day.  I'm just going in here for breakfast.  Come in when you're through.\"\r\n\r\n \"I will,\" said Hurstwood, moving away.  The whole conversation was a trial to him.  It seemed to add complications with very word.  This man called up a thousand memories.  He represented everything he had left.  Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort— all these were in his greeting and inquiries.  And here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him.  All at once the Chicago papers would arrive.  The local papers would have accounts in them this very day.  He forgot his triumph with Carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man's eyes, a safe-breaker.  He could have groaned as he went into the barber shop.  He decided to escape and seek a more secluded hotel.\r\n\r\n Accordingly, when he came out he was glad to see the lobby clear, and hastened toward the stairs.  He would get Carrie and go out by the ladies' entrance. "

        "text":" The paltry sum of thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent, clothing, food, and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little calculated to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend five times that sum in the course of a year.  He thought upon the subject rather actively the first few days he was in New York, and decided that he must act quickly.  As a consequence, he consulted the business opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own account.\r\n\r\n That was not before he had become settled, however.  Carrie and he went looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street near Amsterdam Avenue.  It was a five-story building, and their flat was on the third floor.  Owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly, it was possible to see east to the green tops of the trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows.  For the privilege of six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were compelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month—an average, and yet exorbitant, rent for a home at the time.  Carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago and mentioned it.\r\n\r\n \"You'll not find anything better, dear,\" said Hurstwood, \"unless you go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won't have any of these conveniences.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-work.  It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which was a great advantage.  The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very much.  She had enough of the instincts of a housewife to take great satisfaction in these things.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood made arrangements with one of the instalment houses whereby they furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and ten dollars a month.  He then had a little plate, bearing the name G. W. Wheeler, made, which he placed on his letter-box in the hall.  It sounded exceedingly odd to Carrie to be called Mrs. Wheeler by the janitor, but in time she became used to it and looked upon the name as her own.\r\n\r\n These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of the advertised opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing down-town bar.  After the palatial resort in Adams Street, he could not stomach the commonplace saloons which he found advertised.  He lost a number of days looking up these and finding them disagreeable.  He did, however, gain considerable knowledge by talking, for he discovered the influence of Tammany Hall and the value of standing in with the police.  The most profitable and flourishing places he found to be those which conducted anything but a legitimate business, such as that controlled by Fitzgerald and Moy.  Elegant back rooms and private drinking booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places.  He saw by portly keepers, whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds, and whose clothes were properly cut, that the liquor business here, as elsewhere, yielded the same golden profit.  At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street, which seemed an excellent venture.  It was fairly well-appearing and susceptible of improvement.  The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it certainly looked so.\r\n\r\n \"We deal with a very good class of people,\" he told Hurstwood.  \"Merchants, salesmen, and professionals.  It's a well-dressed class.  No bums.  We don't allow 'em in the place.\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for a while.\r\n\r\n \"It's profitable enough for two, is it?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"You can see for yourself if you're any judge of the liquor trade,\" said the owner.  \"This is only one of the two places I have.  The other is down in Nassau Street.  I can't tend to them both alone.  If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn't mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it.\"\r\n\r\n \"I've had experience enough,\" said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy.\r\n\r\n \"Well, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler,\" said the proprietor.\r\n\r\n He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in.  There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate.\r\n\r\n The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable.  It was not the time, however, after many failures to find what he wanted, to hesitate.  It looked as though a third would pay a hundred a month now.  By judicious management and improvement, it might be made to pay more.  Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership, and made over his thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day.\r\n\r\n His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carrie that he thought he had made an excellent arrangement.  Time, however, introduced food for reflection.  He found his partner to be very disagreeable.  Frequently he was the worse for liquor, which made him surly.  This was the last thing which Hurstwood was used to in business.  Besides, the business varied.  It was nothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed in Chicago.  He found that it would take a long time to make friends.  These people hurried in and out without seeking the pleasures of friendship.  It was no gathering or lounging place.  Whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago.\r\n\r\n For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities—those well- dressed, elite individuals who lend grace to the average bars and bring news from far-off and exclusive circles.  He did not see one such in a month.  Evenings, when still at his post, he would occasionally read in the evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knew—whom he had drunk a glass with many a time.  They would visit a bar like Fitzgerald and Moy's in Chicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he knew that he would never see them down here.  Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought.  It increased a little, but he found he would have to watch his household expenses, which was humiliating.\r\n\r\n In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he did, and find Carrie.  He managed to run up and take dinner with her between six and seven, and to remain home until nine o'clock in the morning, but the novelty of this waned after a time, and he began to feel the drag of his duties.\r\n\r\n The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very natural way: \"I think I'll go down this week and buy a dress.'\r\n\r\n \"What kind?\"  said Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, something for street wear.\"\r\n\r\n \"All right,\" he answered, smiling, although he noted mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn't.  Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following morning he asked:\r\n\r\n \"Have you done anything about your dress?\"\r\n\r\n \"Not yet,\" said Carrie.\r\n\r\n He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said:\r\n\r\n \"Would you mind putting it off a few days?\"\r\n\r\n \"No,\" replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks.  She had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before.  \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, I'll tell you,\" said Hurstwood.  \"This investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now.  I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh!\"  answered Carrie.  \"Why, certainly, dear.  Why didn't you tell me before?\"\r\n\r\n \"It wasn't necessary,\" said Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through.  It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning.  It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation.  Carrie was not dull by any means.  Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another.  The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not.  Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself.  Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada.  Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large.  She noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about his business.  This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago— not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known.  The change was too obvious to escape detection.\r\n\r\n In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence.  He was evidently secretive and kept his own counsel.  She found herself asking him questions about little things.  This is a disagreeable state to a woman.  Great love makes it seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory.  Where great love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is reached.\r\n\r\n As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a changed condition.  He was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was, and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former, hour after hour, and day after day.\r\n\r\n Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city.  It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew.  There was no time for simulating non-recognition.  The exchange of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent.  So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping.\r\n\r\n \"How are you?\"  he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest.\r\n\r\n \"Very well,\" said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed.  \"How is it with you?\"\r\n\r\n \"All right;  I'm down here doing a little buying.  Are you located here now?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said Hurstwood, \"I have a place down in Warren Street.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is that so?\"  said the friend.  \"Glad to hear it.  I'll come down and see you.\"\r\n\r\n \"Do,\" said Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n \"So long,\" said the other, smiling affably and going on.\r\n\r\n \"He never asked for my number,\" thought Hurstwood;  \"he wouldn't think of coming.\"  He wiped his forehead, which had grown damp, and hoped sincerely he would meet no one else.\r\n\r\n These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was.  His one hope was that things would change for the better in a money way.\r\n\r\n He had Carrie.  His furniture was being paid for.  He was maintaining his position.  As for Carrie, the amusements he could give her would have to do for the present.  He could probably keep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure to make good, and then all would be well.  He failed therein to take account of the frailties of human nature—the difficulties of matrimonial life.  Carrie was young.  With him and with her varying mental states were common.  At any moment the extremes of feeling might be anti-polarised at the dinner table.  This often happens in the best regulated families.  Little things brought out on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward.  Where that is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXI\r\n\r\n A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE—BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYS\r\n\r\n The effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood was paralleled in the case of Carrie, who accepted the things which fortune provided with the most genial good-nature.  New York, despite her first expression of disapproval, soon interested her exceedingly.  Its clear atmosphere, more populous thoroughfares, and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly.  She had never seen such a little flat as hers, and yet it soon enlisted her affection.  The new furniture made an excellent showing, the sideboard which Hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly.  The furniture for each room was appropriate, and in the so-called parlour, or front room, was installed a piano, because Carrie said she would like to learn to play.  She kept a servant and developed rapidly in household tactics and information.  For the first time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justified in the eyes of society as she conceived of it.  Her thoughts were merry and innocent enough.  For a long while she concerned herself over the arrangement of New York flats, and wondered at ten families living in one building and all remaining strange and indifferent to each other.  She also marvelled at the whistles of the hundreds of vessels in the harbour—the long, low cries of the Sound steamers and ferry-boats when fog was on.  The mere fact that these things spoke from the sea made them wonderful.  She looked much at what she could see of the Hudson from her west windows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand.  It was much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her for more than a year without becoming stale.\r\n\r\n For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his affection for her.  Troubled as he was, he never exposed his difficulties to her.  He carried himself with the same self- important air, took his new state with easy familiarity, and rejoiced in Carrie's proclivities and successes.  Each evening he arrived promptly to dinner, and found the little dining-room a most inviting spectacle.  In a way, the smallness of the room added to its luxury.  It looked full and replete.  The white- covered table was arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with a four-armed candelabra, each light of which was topped with a red shade.  Between Carrie and the girl the steaks and chops came out all right, and canned goods did the rest for a while.  Carrie studied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stage where she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for her labour.\r\n\r\n In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed.  Winter came, and with it a feeling that indoors was best, so that the attending of theatres was not much talked of.  Hurstwood made great efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feeling one way or the other.  He pretended that he was reinvesting his money in strengthening the business for greater ends in the future.  He contented himself with a very moderate allowance of personal apparel, and rarely suggested anything for Carrie.  Thus the first winter passed.\r\n\r\n In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did increase somewhat.  He got out of it regularly the $150 per month which he had anticipated.  Unfortunately, by this time Carrie had reached certain conclusions, and he had scraped up a few acquaintances.\r\n\r\n Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature, Carrie accepted the situation.  Her state seemed satisfactory enough.  Once in a while they would go to a theatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the city, but they picked up no acquaintances.  Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity.  There were no misunderstandings, no apparent differences of opinion.  In fact, without money or visiting friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment.  Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago.  New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient.\r\n\r\n However, as Hurstwood's business increased, he, as stated, began to pick up acquaintances.  He also began to allow himself more clothes.  He convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner.  The first time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained.  Carrie ate alone, and wished that it might not happen again.  The second time, also, he sent word, but at the last moment.  The third time he forgot entirely and explained afterwards.  These events were months apart, each.\r\n\r\n \"Where were you, George?\"  asked Carrie, after the first absence.\r\n\r\n \"Tied up at the office,\" he said genially.  \"There were some accounts I had to straighten.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'm sorry you couldn't get home,\" she said kindly.  \"I was fixing to have such a nice dinner.\"\r\n\r\n The second time he gave a similar excuse, but the third time the feeling about it in Carrie's mind was a little bit out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n \"I couldn't get home,\" he said, when he came in later in the evening, \"I was so busy.\"\r\n\r\n \"Couldn't you have sent me word?\"  asked Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"I meant to,\" he said, \"but you know I forgot it until it was too late to do any good.\"\r\n\r\n \"And I had such a good dinner!\"  said Carrie.\r\n\r\n Now, it so happened that from his observations of Carrie he began to imagine that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind.  He really thought, after a year, that her chief expression in life was finding its natural channel in household duties. "

They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole.

        "text":"MOSCOW  —  The shot opens at the top of a flight of stairs and zooms in shakily on a gray-haired man, who sits at a desk furtively checking off what appear to be ballots  —  a stack of them.  The video is shot with the grain and chop of an amateur.  But it is apparently sharp enough. \r\n\r\n “A big hello to you,” says the cameraman, Yegor Duda, a 33-year-old volunteer election observer.  “This is a violation of the criminal code.  The chairman of the electoral commission is filling out ballots.  Everything has been captured on the video camera,” he said. \r\n\r\n Mr. Duda raced home and uploaded the clip to YouTube.  Though just three minutes long, it quickly became an election-day sensation, helping fuel a major demonstration of as many as 5,000 people on Monday evening in central Moscow.  They chanted “Russia without Putin!”  and “Putin is a thief.”   Several hundred were arrested, including two major opposition leaders.  \r\n\r\n Valentin Gorbunov, the head of the Moscow City Elections Commission, confirmed the substance of the video and announced that Russian investigators had opened a case into ballot tampering by the head at Polling Place No. 2501, where the episode occurred, Russian news agencies reported Monday. \r\n\r\n Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that they, too, had observed blatant fraud, including the brazen stuffing of ballot boxes.  While the monitors declined to draw firm conclusions, it was clear from their report that vote stealing and other alleged malfeasance might have spared the presumed beneficiary, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin’s United Russia, an even worse blow than it officially received. \r\n\r\n Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton sharply criticized what she called “troubling practices” before and during the vote in Russia.  “The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,” she said in Bonn, Germany. \r\n\r\n With 99.9 percent of ballots processed, election officials said that United Russia had won 238 seats in Parliament, or about 53 percent, from 315 seats or 70 percent now.  The Communist Party won 92 seats;  Just Russia, a social democratic party, won 64 seats and the national Liberal Democratic Party won 56 seats. \r\n\r\n The scathing report by international observers, combined with the amateur video of alleged election malfeasance posted on the Web, made clear that the authorities would face continuing questions about the fairness of the vote despite the main party’s steep losses. \r\n\r\n Indeed, on Monday evening, thousands of demonstrators gathered on a promenade by the Chistye Prudy metro station in central Moscow, and denounced the government at an event organized by the opposition group Solidarity.  It was one of the largest such rallies in recent memory. \r\n\r\n Throngs chanted “Russia without Putin!”  and “Putin is a Thief.”  Police officials estimated the crowd at about 2,000 though some participants said it was larger.  There was a presence of police officers in riot gear and some protesters were detained. \r\n\r\n Mr. Duda’s video was just one of several clips putatively documenting violations to go racing through the Internet during parliamentary elections on Sunday, a relatively new weapon in the fight against vote rigging that has begun to expose Russians to the realities of their electoral system like never before. \r\n\r\n “To be honest, I didn’t expect there to be any violations.  I hoped there wouldn’t be,” Mr. Duda, who had never been an election observer before, said in a brief telephone interview.  “I now understand better what goes on there.  And as long as I think it will be useful, I will continue to tell people about what is happening.” \r\n\r\n Mr. Duda is one of a number of freelance election observers in Russia, who, with the help of hand-held cameras and smartphones, have grown increasingly successful at frustrating voter fraud here. \r\n\r\n It is not clear whether this tactic will ever succeed in changing the conduct of elections in Russia.  With many of the videos apparently showing violations by United Russia, officials on Monday moved quickly to discount them. \r\n\r\n “I’ve seen these clips people are uploading to the Internet,” Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said.  “Nothing can be seen in them.” \r\n\r\n But many of the millions of Russians who have watched the videos seem convinced that they are witnessing fraud. \r\n\r\n In another video from Moscow, observers from the opposition Yabloko party demonstrated that the ink in pens supplied in voting booths at one polling place on Sunday was easily erasable. \r\n\r\n Another showed packets of ballots apparently just removed from the ballot box, stacked neatly, one on top of the other, an indication that they were inserted together, not individually.  All were marked for United Russia. \r\n\r\n Among the most widely circulated videos was one shot by amateur cameramen accompanying journalists and other election observers who had reportedly infiltrated a group hired to stuff ballot boxes in Moscow.  Caught with multiple ballots marked for United Russia in bags they wore under their clothes, some involved in the plot tried to flee.  The video showed the police stopping them at the doors. \r\n\r\n Andrei Kursov, a 24-year-old employee of a tobacco company, helped record the episode.  Speaking by telephone, he said the police at the polling place were initially aggressive to the observers and unwilling to take action against the violators.  One threatened to beat him over the head if he refused to stop recording, he said. \r\n\r\n “The law enforcement agencies typically try not to pay attention to violations,” Mr. Kursov said.  “But with the camera there, they were probably afraid this time that if they let these guys go they would get in trouble.” \r\n\r\n Such videos have appeared in the past, but this seems to be the first election in which the tactic was put to such widespread and effective use.  Even the international observers from the O.S.C.E.  praised the work of amateur election monitors. \r\n\r\n “We saw in the campaign before the elections all sorts of possible tricks being shown and displayed on the Internet,” said Ambassador Heidi Tagliavini, the head of the election observation mission of the group’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.  “This was, I would say, a new feature.” \r\n\r\n Glenn Kates contributed reporting from Moscow, and Steven Lee Myers from Bonn, Germany."

I saw one there that I know would look stunning on you.  I said so when I saw it.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie listened to these things with considerable interest, for they were suggested with more of friendliness than is usually common between pretty women.  Mrs. Vance liked Carrie's stable good-nature so well that she really took pleasure in suggesting to her the latest things.\r\n\r\n \"Why don't you get yourself one of those nice serge skirts they're selling at Lord & Taylor's?\"  she said one day.  \"They're the circular style, and they're going to be worn from now on.  A dark blue one would look so nice on you.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie listened with eager ears.  These things never came up between her and Hurstwood.  Nevertheless, she began to suggest one thing and another, which Hurstwood agreed to without any expression of opinion.  He noticed the new tendency on Carrie's part, and finally, hearing much of Mrs. Vance and her delightful ways, suspected whence the change came.  He was not inclined to offer the slightest objection so soon, but he felt that Carrie's wants were expanding.  This did not appeal to him exactly, but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood.  Still, there was something in the details of the transactions which caused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to him.  He did not enthuse over the purchases.  This led her to believe that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedge was entered.\r\n\r\n Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance's suggestions was the fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own satisfaction.  She had on her best, but there was comfort in the thought that if she must confine herself to a best, it was neat and fitting.  She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty- one, and Mrs. Vance praised her, which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes.  It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife's request, had called a coach.  \"Your husband isn't coming?\"  suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little parlour.\r\n\r\n \"No;  he said he wouldn't be home for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n \"Better leave a little note for him, telling him where we are.  He might turn up.\"\r\n\r\n \"I will,\" said Carrie, who had not thought of it before.\r\n\r\n \"Tell him we'll be at Sherry's until eight o'clock.  He knows, though I guess.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves on.  When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat.\r\n\r\n \"Mrs.  Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine,\" said Mrs. Vance.  \"He's going along with us, aren't you, Bob?\"\r\n\r\n \"I'm very glad to meet you,\" said Ames, bowing politely to Carrie.\r\n\r\n The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure.  She also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, good looking, and young, but nothing more.\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Ames is just down in New York for a few days,\" put in Vance, \"and we're trying to show him around a little.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, are you?\"  said Carrie, taking another glance at the newcomer.\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  I am just on here from Indianapolis for a week or so,\" said young Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while Mrs. Vance completed the last touches of her toilet.\r\n\r\n \"I guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don't you?\"  said Carrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence.\r\n\r\n"
