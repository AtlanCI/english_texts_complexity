        "text":" As soon as I was inside the Maer’s estate I sent a ring and note to Stapes, knowing it would be the quickest way to get in touch with the Maer for a private conversation.  I made it back to my room with little delay, though it meant brushing roughly past a few courtiers in the halls.  I had just set down my travelsack and sent runners for hot water when Stapes appeared in the doorway.\r\n “Young Master Kvothe!”  he beamed, grabbing my hand to shake it.  “It’s good to have you back.  Lord and lady, but I’ve been worried about you.”\r\n His enthusiasm wrung a tired smile from me.  “It’s good to be back, Stapes.  Have I missed much?”\r\n “Much?”  He laughed.  “The wedding for one.”\r\n “Wedding?”  I asked, but I knew the answer as soon as I said it.  “The Maer’s wedding?”\r\n Stapes nodded excitedly.  “Oh, it was a grand thing.  It’s a shame you had to be gone for it, considering.”  He gave a knowing look, but didn’t say anything else.  Stapes was always very discreet.\r\n “They didn’t waste much time, did they?”\r\n “It’s been two months since the betrothal,” Stapes said with a hint of reproach.  “Not a bit less than proper.”  I saw him relax a bit, and he gave me a wink.  “Which isn’t to say they weren’t both a bit eager.”\r\n I chuckled as runner boys came through the open door with buckets of steaming water.  The splashing as they began to fill the bath was like sweet music.\r\n The manservant watched them leave, then leaned close and said in a quieter voice, “You’ll be glad to hear our other unresolved matter has been tended to properly.”\r\n I looked at him blankly, searching through my memory for what he might be referring to.  So much had happened since I’d left. . . .\r\n Stapes saw my expression.  “Caudicus,” he said, his mouth twisting bitterly around the name.  “Dagon brought him back only two days after you left.  He’d gone to ground not ten miles from the city.”\r\n “So close?”  I asked, surprised.\r\n Stapes nodded grimly.  “He was tucked away in a farmhouse like a badger in a burrow.  He killed four of the Maer’s personal guard and cost Dagon an eye.  In the end they only caught him by setting fire to the place.”\r\n “And what happened then?”  I asked.  “Not a trial, certainly.”\r\n “The matter was tended to,” Stapes repeated.  “Properly.”  He said the last with a great weight of grim finality.  His normally kind eyes were narrow with hate.  In that moment the round-faced little man looked very little like a grocer at all.\r\n I remembered Alveron calmly saying, “take off his thumbs.”  Given what I knew of Alveron’s swift and decisive anger, I doubted anyone would ever see Caudicus again.\r\n “Did the Maer manage to uncover why?”  Even though I spoke softly, I left the rest unsaid, knowing Stapes would not approve of my mentioning the poisoning openly.\r\n “It’s not my place to say,” Stapes said carefully.  His tone was slightly offended, as if I should know better than to ask him such things.\r\n I let the subject go, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to get anything else out of Stapes.  “You’d be doing me a favor if you could deliver something to the Maer for me,” I said, walking to where I’d dropped my worn travelsack.  I rooted through it until I found the Maer’s lockbox down near the bottom.\r\n I held it out to Stapes.  “I’m not sure what’s in it,” I said.  “But it’s got his crest on the top.  And it’s heavy.  I hope it might be some of the taxes that were stolen.”  I smiled.  “Tell him it’s a wedding present.”\r\n Stapes took hold of the box, smiling.  “I’m sure he’ll be delighted.”\r\n Three more runners appeared, but only two of them ran past with steaming buckets.  The third went to Stapes and handed him a note.  There was more splashing in the other room, and all three of the boys left again, stealing glances at me\r\n Stapes skimmed the note then looked up at me.  “The Maer is hoping it would be convenient for you to meet him in the garden at fifth bell,” he said.\r\n The garden meant polite conversation.  If the Maer had wanted a serious discussion he would have summoned me to his rooms, or paid me a call through the secret passage that connected his rooms with mine.\r\n I looked at the clock on the wall.  It wasn’t a sympathy clock of the sort I was used to at the University.  This was a harmony clock, swinging pendulum and all.  Beautiful machinery, but not nearly as accurate.  Its hands showed a quarter to the hour.\r\n “Is that clock fast, Stapes?”  I asked hopefully.  Fifteen minutes was barely enough time for me to strip out of my road clothes and lace myself into some sufficiently decorous court finery.  But given the layers of dirt and sour sweat that covered me, that would be as pointless as tying a silk ribbon around a steaming cowpat.\r\n Stapes looked over my shoulder, then checked a small gear watch he kept in his pocket.  “It looks about five minutes slow, actually.”\r\n I rubbed my face, considering my options.  I wasn’t simply mussed from a day’s travel.  I was filthy.  I had walked hard under the summer sun, then spent days trapped in a stifling-hot carriage.  While the Maer was not one to judge things entirely by appearances, he did value propriety.  I would not make a good impression if I showed up reeking and filthy.\r\n Unbidden, the memory of the iron gibbet rose up in my mind, and I decided I couldn’t risk making a bad impression.  Not with the news I brought.  “Stapes, I won’t be ready for at least an hour.  I could meet with him at sixth bell if he would like.”\r\n Stapes’ expression turned stiff and affronted.  Its message was clear.  You simply didn’t request a different meeting time with the Maer Alveron.  He asked.  You came.  That was the way of things.\r\n “Stapes,” I said as gently as I could.  “Look at me.  Smell me.  I’ve come three hundred miles in the last span of days.  I’m not going to go strolling in the garden covered in road dust and reeking like a barbarian.”\r\n Stapes’ mouth firmed into a frown.  “I’ll tell him you’re otherwise occupied.”\r\n More steaming buckets arrived.  “Tell him the truth, Stapes,” I said as I began to unbutton my shirt.  “I’m sure he’ll understand.”\r\n\r\n After I was scrubbed, brushed, and properly dressed, I sent the Maer my golden ring and a card that said, “Private conversation at your earliest convenience.”\r\n Within an hour a runner returned with a card from the Maer saying, “Await my summons.”\r\n I waited.  I sent a runner to fetch dinner, then waited the rest of the evening.  The following day passed without any further message.  And, because I didn’t know when Alveron’s summons might come, I was effectively trapped in my rooms again, waiting for his ring.\r\n It was nice to have time to catch up on my sleep and have a second bath.  But I was worried about the news from Levinshir catching up with me.  The fact that I couldn’t make my way down to Severen-Low to look for Denna was a vast irritation as well.\r\n It was the sort of silent rebuke all too common in courtly settings.  The Maer’s message was clear: When I call, you come.  My terms or not at all.\r\n It was childish in the way only the nobility can be.  Still, there was nothing to be done.  So I sent my silver ring to Bredon.  He arrived in time to share supper with me and caught me up on the season’s worth of gossip I’d missed.  Court rumor can be terribly insipid stuff, but Bredon skimmed the cream off the top for me.\r\n Most of it centered around the Maer’s whirlwind courtship and marriage to the Lackless heir.  They were besotted with each other, apparently.  Many suspected a child might already be on the way.  The royal court in Renere was busy too.  The Prince Regent Alaitis had been killed in a duel, sending much of the southern farrel into chaos as various nobility did their best to capitalize on the death of such a highly ranked member of the court.\r\n There were rumors too.  The Maer’s men had taken care of some bandits off in a remote piece of the Eld.  They’d been waylaying tax collectors, apparently.  There was grumbling in the north, where folk had to suffer a second visit from the Maer’s collectors.  But at least the roads were clear again, and those responsible were dead.\r\n Bredon also mentioned an interesting rumor of a young man who had gone to visit Felurian and come back more or less intact, though slightly fae around the edges.  It wasn’t a court rumor, exactly.  More the sort of thing you heard in a taproom.  A low sort of rumor no highborn person would ever deign to lend an ear to.  His dark, owlish eyes glittered merrily as he spoke.\r\n I agreed that such stories were indeed quite low, and beneath the notice of fine persons such as ourselves.  My cloak?  It was rather fine, was it not?  I couldn’t remember where exactly I’d had it tailored.  Somewhere exotic.  By the way, I’d heard quite an interesting song the other day on the subject of Felurian.  Would he like to hear it?\r\n We also played tak, of course.  Despite the fact that I had spent a long time away from the board, Bredon said my playing was much improved.  It seemed I was learning how to play a beautiful game.\r\n\r\n Needless to say, when Alveron sent his next summons, I came.  I was tempted to arrive a few minutes late, but I resisted, knowing no good could come of it.\r\n The Maer was walking about on his own when I met him in the garden.  He stood straight and tall, looking for all the world as if he’d never needed to lean on my arm or use a walking stick.\r\n “Kvothe,” he smiled warmly.  “I’m glad you could find time to visit me.”\r\n “Always my pleasure, your grace.”\r\n “Shall we walk?”  he asked.  “The view is pleasant from the south bridge this time of day.”\r\n I fell into step beside him, and we began to wind our way among the carefully tended hedges.\r\n “I could not help but notice that you are armed,” he remarked, disapproval heavy on his voice.\r\n My hand went unconsciously to Caesura.  It was at my hip now, rather than over my shoulder.  “Is there aught amiss with that, your grace?  I have understood that all men keep the right to gird themselves in Vintas.”\r\n “It is hardly proper.”  He stressed the word.\r\n “I understand that in the king’s court in Renere, there’s not a gentleman would dare be seen without a sword.”\r\n “Well-spoken as you are, you are no gentleman,” Alveron pointed out coolly, “as you would do well to remember.”\r\n I said nothing.\r\n “Besides, it is a barbarian custom, and one that will bring the king to grief in time.  No matter what the custom in Renere, in my city, my house, and my garden, you will not come before me armed.”  He turned to look at me with hard eyes.\r\n “I apologize if I have given any offense, your grace.”  I stopped and offered him a more earnest bow than the one I’d given before.\r\n My show of submission seemed to appease him.  He smiled and laid a hand on my shoulder.  “There’s no need for all that.  Come, look at the mourningfire.  The leaves will be turning soon.”\r\n We walked for a piece of an hour, chatting amiably about small nothings.  I was unfailingly polite and Alveron’s mood continued to improve.  If catering to his ego kept me in his good graces, it was a small price to pay for his patronage.\r\n “I must say that marriage suits your grace.”\r\n “Thank you.”  He nodded graciously.  “I have found it much to my liking.”\r\n “And your health continues well?”  I asked, pressing the boundaries of public conversation.\r\n “Exceeding well,” he said.  “Another benefit of married life, no doubt.”  He gave me a look that told me he would not appreciate further inquiry, at least not in so public a place as this.\r\n We continued our walk, nodding to the nobles we passed.  The Maer chatted on about trivialities, rumors in the court.  I played along, filling my part in the conversation.  But the truth was, I needed to have done with this so we could have an earnest conversation in private.\r\n But I also knew Alveron could not be rushed into a discussion.  Our talks had a ritual pattern.  If I violated that, I would do nothing but annoy him.  So I bided my time, smelled the flowers, and pretended interest in the gossip of the court.\r\n After a quarter hour, there was a characteristic pause in the conversation.  Next we would engage in an argument.  After that we could go somewhere private enough to speak of important matters.\r\n “I have always thought,” Alveron said at last, introducing the topic of our discussion, “that everyone has a question that rests in the center of who they are.”\r\n “How do you mean, your grace?”\r\n “I believe everyone has some question that drives them.  A question that keeps them awake nights.  A question they worry like a dog with an old bone.  If you understand a man’s question, it brings you closer to understanding the man himself.”  He looked sideways at me, half-smiling.  “Or so I have always believed.”\r\n I thought on it for a moment.  “I would have to agree with you, your grace.”\r\n Alveron raised an eyebrow at this.  “As easy as that?”  He sounded slightly disappointed.  “I was expecting a bit of a struggle from you.”\r\n I shook my head, glad for the easy opportunity to introduce a topic of my own.  “I’ve been worrying at a question for some years now, and I expect I will worry it some few years more.  So what you say makes a perfect sense to me.”\r\n “Really?”  he said hungrily.  “What is it?”\r\n I considered telling him the truth.  About my search for the Chandrian and the death of my troupe.  But there was no real chance of that.  That secret still sat in my heart, heavy as a great smooth stone.  It was too personal a thing to tell someone as clever as the Maer.  What’s more, it would reveal my Edema Ruh blood, something I had not made public knowledge in the Maer’s court.  The Maer knew I wasn’t nobility, but he didn’t know my blood was quite so low as that.\r\n"

I know a few people who might be able to translate it at the University.”\r\n Alveron looked to Meluan, but she shook her head firmly.  “I will not have this spoken of to strangers.”\r\n The Maer seemed disappointed by this answer, but didn’t press the point.  Instead he turned back to me.  “Let me ask you your own questions back again.  What sort of wood is it?”\r\n “It’s lasted three thousand years,” I mused aloud.  “It’s heavy despite being hollow.  So it has to be a slow wood, like hornbeam or rennel.  Its color and weight make me think it has a good deal of metal in it too, like roah.  Probably iron and copper.”  I shrugged.  “That’s the best I can do.”\r\n “What’s inside it?”\r\n I thought for a long moment before saying anything.  “Something smaller than a saltbox. . .  .”  I began.  Meluan smiled, but Alveron gave the barest of frowns so I hurried on.  “Something metal, by the way the weight shifts when I tilt it.”  I closed my eyes and listened to the padded thump of its contents moving in the box.  “No.  By the weight of it, perhaps something made of glass or stone.”\r\n “Something precious,” Alveron said.\r\n I opened my eyes.  “Not necessarily.  It has become precious because it is old, and because it has been with a family for so long.  It is also precious because it is a mystery.  But was it precious to begin with?”  I shrugged.  “Who can say?”\r\n “But you lock up precious things,” Alveron pointed out.\r\n “Precisely.”  I held up the box, displaying its smooth face.  “This isn’t locked up.  In fact, it might be locked away.  It may be something dangerous.”\r\n “Why would you say that?”  Alveron asked curiously.\r\n “Why go through this trouble?”  Meluan protested.  “Why save something dangerous?  If something is dangerous, you destroy it.”  She seemed to answer her own question as soon as she had voiced it.  “Unless it was precious as well as dangerous.”\r\n “Perhaps it was too useful to destroy,” Alveron suggested.\r\n “Perhaps it couldn’t be destroyed,” I said.\r\n “Last and best,” Alveron said, leaning forward even further in his seat.  “How do you open it?”\r\n I gave the box a long look, turned it in my hands, pressed the sides.  I ran my fingers over the patterns, feeling for a seam my eyes could not detect.  I shook it gently, tasted the air around it, held it to the light.\r\n “I have no idea,” I admitted.\r\n Alveron slumped a little.  “It was too much to expect, I suppose.  Perhaps some piece of magic?”\r\n I hesitated to tell him that sort of magic only existed in stories.  “None I have at my command.”\r\n “Have you ever considered simply cutting it open?”  Alveron asked his wife.\r\n Meluan looked every bit as horrified as I felt at the suggestion.  “Never!”  She said as soon as she caught her breath.  “It is the very root of our family.  I would sooner think of salting every acre of our lands.”\r\n “And hard as this wood is,” I hurried to say, “you would most likely ruin whatever was inside.  Especially if it is delicate.”\r\n “It was only a thought.”  Alveron reassured his wife.\r\n “An ill-considered one,” Meluan said sharply, then seemed to regret her words.  “I’m sorry, but the very thought . .  .”  She trailed off, obviously distraught.\r\n He patted her hand.  “I understand, my dear.  You’re right, it was ill-considered.”\r\n “Might I put it away now?”  Meluan asked him.\r\n I reluctantly handed the box back to Meluan.  “If there were a lock I could attempt to circumvent it, but I can’t even make a guess at where the hinge might be, or the seam for the lid.”  In a box, no lid or locks / Lackless keeps her husband’s rocks.  The child’s skipping rhyme ran madly through my head and I only barely managed to turn my laugh into a cough.\r\n Alveron didn’t seem to notice.  “As always, I trust to your discretion.”  He got to his feet.  “Unfortunately, I fear I have used up the better portion of our time.  I’m certain you have other matters to attend to.  Shall we meet tomorrow to discuss the Amyr?  Second bell?”\r\n I had risen to my feet with the Maer.  “If it please your grace, I have another matter that warrants some discussion.”\r\n He gave me a serious look.  “I trust this is an important matter.”\r\n “Most urgent, your grace,” I said nervously.  “It should not wait another day.  I would have mentioned it sooner, had we both privacy and time.”\r\n “Very well,” he sat back down.  “What presses you so direly?”\r\n “Lerand,” Meluan said with slight reproach.  “It is past the hour.  Hayanis will be waiting.”\r\n “Let him wait,” he said.  “Kvothe has served me well in all regards.  He does nothing lightly, and I ignore him only to my detriment.”\r\n “You flatter me, your grace.  This matter is a grave one.”  I glanced at Meluan.  “And somewhat delicate as well.  If your lady desires to leave, it might be for the best.”\r\n “If the matter is important, should I not stay?”  she asked archly.\r\n I gave the Maer a questioning look.\r\n “Anything you wish to say to me you can tell my lady wife,” he said.\r\n I hesitated.  I needed to tell Alveron about the false troupers soon.  I was sure if he heard my version of events first, I could present them in a way that cast me in a favorable light.  If word came through official channels first he might not be willing to overlook the bald facts of the situation, that I had slaughtered nine travelers of my own free will.\r\n Despite that, the last thing I wanted was Meluan present for the conversation.  It couldn’t help but complicate the situation.  I tried one final time.  “It is a matter most dark, your grace.”\r\n Alveron shook his head, frowning slightly.  “We have no secrets.”\r\n I fought down a resigned sigh and drew a thick piece of folded parchment from an inner pocket of my shaed.  “Is this one of the writs of patronage your grace has granted?”\r\n His grey eyes flickered over it, showing some surprise.  “Yes.  How did you come by it?”\r\n “Oh, Lerand,” Meluan said.  “I knew you let the beggars travel in your lands, but I never thought you would stoop to patronizing them as well.”\r\n “Only a handful of troupes,” he said.  “As befitting my rank.  Every respectable household has at least a few players.”\r\n “Mine,” Meluan said firmly, “does not.”\r\n “It is convenient to have one’s own troupe,” Alveron said gently.  “And more convenient to have several.  Then one can choose the proper entertainment to accompany whatever event you might be hosting.  Where do you think the musicians at our wedding came from?”\r\n When Meluan’s expression did not soften, Alveron continued.  “They’re not permitted to perform anything bawdy or heathen, dear.  I keep them under most close controlment.  And rest assured, no town in my lands would let a troupe perform unless they had a noble’s writ with them.”\r\n Alveron turned back to me.  “Which brings us back to the matter at hand.  How did you come to have their writ?  The troupe must be doing poorly without it.”\r\n I hesitated.  With Meluan here, I was unsure as to the best way to approach the subject.  I’d planned on speaking to the Maer alone.  “They are, your grace.  They were killed.”\r\n The Maer showed no surprise.  “I thought as much.  Such things are unfortunate, but they happen from time to time.”\r\n Meluan’s eyes flashed.  “I’d give a great deal to see them happen more often.”\r\n “Have you any idea who killed them?”  the Maer asked.\r\n “In a certain manner of speaking, your grace.”\r\n He raised his eyebrows expectantly.  “Well then?”\r\n “I did.”\r\n “You did what?”\r\n I sighed.  “I killed the men carrying that writ, your grace.”\r\n He stiffened in his seat.  “What?”\r\n “They had kidnapped a pair of girls from a town they passed through.”  I paused, looking for a delicate way of saying it in front of Meluan.  “They were young girls, your grace, and the men were not kind to them.”\r\n Meluan’s expression, already hard, grew cold as ice at this.  But before she could speak, Alveron demanded incredulously, “And you took it on yourself to kill them?  An entire troupe of performers I had given license to?”  He rubbed his forehead.  “How many were there?”\r\n “Nine.”\r\n “Good lord . .  .”\r\n “I think he did right,” Meluan said hotly.  “I say you give him a score of guards and let him do the same to every ravel band of Ruh he finds within your lands.”\r\n “My dear,” Alveron said with a touch of sternness.  “I don’t care for them much more than you, but law is law.  When . .  .”\r\n “Law is what you make it,” she interjected.  “This man has done you a noble service.  You should grant him fief and title and set him on your council.”\r\n “He killed nine of my subjects,” Alveron pointed out sternly.  “When men step outside the rule of law, anarchy results.  If I heard of this in passing, I would hang him for a bandit.”\r\n “He killed nine Ruh rapists.  Nine murdering ravel thieves.  Nine fewer Edema men in the world is a service to us all.”  Meluan looked at me.  “Sir.  I think you did nothing but what was right and proper.”\r\n Her misdirected praise did nothing but fan the fire beneath my temper.  “Not all of them were men, my lady,” I said to her.\r\n Meluan paled a bit at that remark.\r\n Alveron rubbed his face with a hand.  “Good lord, man.  Your honesty is like a felling axe.”\r\n “And I should mention,” I said seriously, “begging both your pardons, that those I killed were not Edema Ruh.  They were not even a real troupe.”\r\n Alveron shook his head tiredly and tapped the writ in front of him.  “It says here otherwise.  Edema Ruh and troupers both.”\r\n “The writ was stolen goods, your grace.  The folk I met on the road had killed a troupe of Ruh and taken up their place.”\r\n He gave me a curious look.  “You seem rather certain of it.”\r\n “One of them told me so, your grace.  He admitted they were merely impersonating a troupe.  They were pretending to be Ruh.”\r\n Meluan looked as if she couldn’t decide whether she was confused or sickened by the thought.  “Who would pretend such a thing?”\r\n Alveron nodded.  “My wife makes a point,” he said.  “It seems more likely that they lied to you.  Who wouldn’t deny such a thing? "

These \"sensibilia\" which are not data to anyone\r\n are therefore to be taken rather as an illustrative hypothesis and as\r\n an aid in preliminary statement than as a dogmatic part of the\r\n philosophy of physics in its final form.\r\n\r\n\r\n VII.  PRIVATE SPACE AND THE SPACE OF PERSPECTIVES\r\n\r\n We have now to explain the ambiguity in the word \"place,\" and how it\r\n comes that two places of different sorts are associated with every\r\n sense-datum, namely the place _at_ which it is and the place _from_\r\n which it is perceived.  The theory to be advocated is closely analogous\r\n to Leibniz's monadology, from which it differs chiefly in being less\r\n smooth and tidy.\r\n\r\n The first fact to notice is that, so far as can be discovered, no\r\n sensibile is ever a datum to two people at once.  The things seen by\r\n two different people are often closely similar, so similar that the\r\n same _words_ can be used to denote them, without which communication\r\n with others concerning sensible objects would be impossible.  But, in\r\n spite of this similarity, it would seem that some difference always\r\n arises from difference in the point of view.  Thus each person, so far\r\n as his sense-data are concerned, lives in a private world.  This\r\n private world contains its own space, or rather spaces, for it would\r\n seem that only experience teaches us to correlate the space of sight\r\n with the space of touch and with the various other spaces of other\r\n senses.  This multiplicity of private spaces, however, though\r\n interesting to the psychologist, is of no great importance in regard\r\n to our present problem, since a merely solipsistic experience enables\r\n us to correlate them into the one private space which embraces all our\r\n own sense-data.  The place _at_ which a sense-datum is, is a place in\r\n private space.  This place therefore is different from any place in the\r\n private space of another percipient.  For if we assume, as logical\r\n economy demands, that all position is relative, a place is only\r\n definable by the things in or around it, and therefore the same place\r\n cannot occur in two private worlds which have no common constituent.\r\n The question, therefore, of combining what we call different\r\n appearances of the same thing in the same place does not arise, and\r\n the fact that a given object appears to different spectators to have\r\n different shapes and colours affords no argument against the physical\r\n reality of all these shapes and colours.\r\n\r\n In addition to the private spaces belonging to the private worlds of\r\n different percipients, there is, however, another space, in which one\r\n whole private world counts as a point, or at least as a spatial unit.\r\n This might be described as the space of points of view, since each\r\n private world may be regarded as the appearance which the universe\r\n presents from a certain point of view.  I prefer, however, to speak of\r\n it as the space of _perspectives_, in order to obviate the suggestion\r\n that a private world is only real when someone views it.  And for the\r\n same reason, when I wish to speak of a private world without assuming\r\n a percipient, I shall call it a \"perspective.\"\r\n\r\n We have now to explain how the different perspectives are ordered in\r\n one space.  This is effected by means of the correlated \"sensibilia\"\r\n which are regarded as the appearances, in different perspectives, of\r\n"

        "text":"2.  The Council with the Munchkins\r\n\r\n She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt.  As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened;  and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally.  Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving;  nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room.  She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\r\n\r\n The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\r\n\r\n The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty.  There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits.  Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.  A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\r\n\r\n While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen.  They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to;  but neither were they very small.  In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.\r\n\r\n Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.  They wore round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.  The hats of the men were blue;  the little woman's hat was white, and she wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.  Over it were sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.  The men were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.  The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had beards.  But the little woman was doubtless much older.  Her face was covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather stiffly.\r\n\r\n When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come farther.  But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and said, in a sweet voice:\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.  We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\r\n\r\n Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.  What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked Witch of the East?  Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;  and she had never killed anything in all her life.\r\n\r\n But the little woman evidently expected her to answer;  so Dorothy said, with hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.  I have not killed anything.\"\r\n\r\n \"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh, \"and that is the same thing.  See!\"  she continued, pointing to the corner of the house.  \"There are her two feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood.\"\r\n\r\n Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.  There, indeed, just under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, dear!  Oh, dear!\"  cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in dismay.  \"The house must have fallen on her.  Whatever shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n \"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\r\n\r\n \"But who was she?\"  asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little woman.  \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years, making them slave for her night and day.  Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.\"\r\n\r\n \"Who are the Munchkins?\"  inquired Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked Witch ruled.\"\r\n\r\n \"Are you a Munchkin?\"  asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.  When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift messenger to me, and I came at once.  I am the Witch of the North.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, gracious!\"  cried Dorothy.  \"Are you a real witch?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, indeed,\" answered the little woman.  \"But I am a good witch, and the people love me.  I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"\r\n\r\n \"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half frightened at facing a real witch.  \"Oh, no, that is a great mistake.  There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who live in the North and the South, are good witches.  I know this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.  Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;  but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West.\"\r\n\r\n \"But,\" said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, \"Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.\"\r\n\r\n \"Who is Aunt Em?\"  inquired the little old woman.\r\n\r\n \"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\"\r\n\r\n The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her eyes upon the ground.  Then she looked up and said, \"I do not know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before.  But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, yes,\" replied Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"Then that accounts for it.  In the civilized countries I believe there are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.  But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world.  Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.\"\r\n\r\n \"Who are the wizards?\"  asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her voice to a whisper.  \"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together.  He lives in the City of Emeralds.\"\r\n\r\n Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\r\n\r\n \"What is it?\"  asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to laugh.  The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was left but the silver shoes.\r\n\r\n \"She was so old,\" explained the Witch of the North, \"that she dried up quickly in the sun.  That is the end of her.  But the silver shoes are yours, and you shall have them to wear.\"  She reached down and picked up the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\" said one of the Munchkins, \"and there is some charm connected with them;  but what it is we never knew.\"\r\n\r\n Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.  Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will worry about me.  Can you help me find my way?\"\r\n\r\n The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy, and then shook their heads.\r\n\r\n \"At the East, not far from here,\" said one, \"there is a great desert, and none could live to cross it.\"\r\n\r\n \"It is the same at the South,\" said another, \"for I have been there and seen it.  The South is the country of the Quadlings.\"\r\n\r\n \"I am told,\" said the third man, \"that it is the same at the West.  And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\"\r\n\r\n \"The North is my home,\" said the old lady, \"and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz.  I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.\"\r\n\r\n Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people.  Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also.  As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted \"One, two, three\" in a solemn voice.  At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\"\r\n\r\n\r\n The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, \"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\r\n\r\n \"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds.  Perhaps Oz will help you.\"\r\n\r\n \"Where is this city?\"  asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is he a good man?\"  inquired the girl anxiously.\r\n\r\n \"He is a good Wizard.  Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.\"\r\n\r\n \"How can I get there?\"  asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n \"You must walk.  It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible.  However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"\r\n\r\n \"Won't you go with me?\"  pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend.\r\n\r\n \"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied, \"but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.\"\r\n\r\n She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.  Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.\r\n\r\n \"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the Witch, \"so you cannot miss it.  When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you.  Good-bye, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away through the trees. "

But the men I killed were not.  No Ruh would do the things they did.”\r\n Meluan’s eyes flashed furiously.  “You do not know them.”\r\n I met her eyes.  “My lady, I think I know them rather well.”\r\n “But why?”  Alveron asked.  “Who in their right mind would try to pass themselves off as Edema Ruh?”\r\n “For ease of travel,” I said.  “And the protection your name offers.”\r\n He shrugged my explanation away.  “They were probably Ruh that tired of honest work and took up thieving instead.”\r\n “No, your grace,” I insisted.  “They were not Edema Ruh.”\r\n Alveron gave me a reproachful look.  “Come now.  Who can tell the difference between bandits and a band of Ruh?”\r\n “There is no difference,” Meluan said crisply.\r\n “Your grace, I would know the difference,” I said hotly.  “I am Edema Ruh.”\r\n Silence.  Meluan’s expression turned from blank shock, to disbelief, to rage, to disgust.  She came to her feet, looked for a moment as if she would spit on me, then walked stiffly out the door.  There was a clatter as her personal guard came to attention and followed her out of the outer rooms.\r\n Alveron continued to look at me, his face severe.  “If this is a joke, it is a poor one.”\r\n “It is none, your grace,” I said, wrestling with my temper.\r\n “And why have you found it necessary to hide this from me?”\r\n “I have not hidden it, your grace.  You yourself have mentioned several times that I am far from gentle birth.”\r\n He struck the arm of his chair angrily.  “You know what I mean!  Why did you never mention that you are one of the Ruh?”\r\n “I think the reason rather obvious, your grace,” I said stiffly, trying to keep from spitting out the words.  “The words ‘Edema Ruh’ have too strong a smell for many gentle noses.  Your wife has found her perfume cannot cover it.”\r\n “My lady has had unfortunate dealings with the Ruh in the past,” he said by way of explanation.  “You would do well to note.”\r\n “I know of her sister.  Her family’s tragic shame.  Run off and love a trouper.  How terrible,” I said scathingly, my entire body prickling with hot rage.  “Her sister’s sense does credit to her family;  less so the actions of your lady wife.  My blood is worth as much as any man’s, and more than most.  And even were it not, she has no leave to treat me as she did.”\r\n Alveron’s expression hardened.  “I rather think that she has leave to treat you as she will,” he said.  “She was simply startled by your sudden proclamation.  Given her feelings about you ravel, I think she showed remarkable restraint.”\r\n “I think she rues the truth.  A trouper’s tongue has gotten her to bed more quickly than her sister.”\r\n As soon as I said it, I knew I had gone too far.  I clenched my teeth to keep from saying anything worse.\r\n “That will be all,” Alveron said with cold formality, his eyes flat and angry.\r\n I left with all the angry dignity I could muster.

        "text":" The motions which are regarded as occurring,\r\nduring a period in which all the \"sensibilia\" and the times of their\r\n appearance are given, will be different according to the manner in\r\n which we combine \"sensibilia\" at different times as belonging to the\r\n same piece of matter.  Thus even when the whole history of the world is\r\n given in every particular, the question what motions take place is\r\n still to a certain extent arbitrary even after the assumption of\r\n continuity.  Experience shows that it is possible to determine motions\r\n in such a way as to satisfy the laws of dynamics, and that this\r\n determination, roughly and on the whole, is fairly in agreement with\r\n the common-sense opinions about persistent things.  This determination,\r\ntherefore, is adopted, and leads to a criterion by which we can\r\n determine, sometimes practically, sometimes only theoretically,\r\nwhether two appearances at different times are to be regarded as\r\n belonging to the same piece of matter.  The persistence of all matter\r\n throughout all time can, I imagine, be secured by definition.\r\n\r\n To recommend this conclusion, we must consider what it is that is\r\n proved by the empirical success of physics.  What is proved is that its\r\n hypotheses, though unverifiable where they go beyond sense-data, are\r\n at no point in contradiction with sense-data, but, on the contrary,\r\nare ideally such as to render all sense-data calculable when a\r\n sufficient collection of \"sensibilia\" is given.  Now physics has found\r\n it empirically possible to collect sense-data into series, each series\r\n being regarded as belonging to one \"thing,\" and behaving, with regard\r\n to the laws of physics, in a way in which series not belonging to one\r\n thing would in general not behave.  If it is to be unambiguous whether\r\n two appearances belong to the same thing or not, there must be only\r\n one way of grouping appearances so that the resulting things obey the\r\n laws of physics.  It would be very difficult to prove that this is the\r\n case, but for our present purposes we may let this point pass, and\r\n assume that there is only one way.  Thus we may lay down the following\r\n definition: _Physical things are those series of appearances whose\r\n matter obeys the laws of physics_.  That such series exist is an\r\n empirical fact, which constitutes the verifiability of physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n XII.  ILLUSIONS, HALLUCINATIONS, AND DREAMS\r\n\r\n It remains to ask how, in our system, we are to find a place for\r\n sense-data which apparently fail to have the usual connection with the\r\n world of physics.  Such sense-data are of various kinds, requiring\r\n somewhat different treatment.  But all are of the sort that would be\r\n called \"unreal,\" and therefore, before embarking upon the discussion,\r\ncertain logical remarks must be made upon the conceptions of reality\r\n and unreality.\r\n\r\n Mr. A. Wolf[31] says:\r\n\r\n  \"The conception of mind as a system of transparent activities is,\r\n  I think, also untenable because of its failure to account for the\r\n very possibility of dreams and hallucinations.  It seems impossible\r\n to realise how a bare, transparent activity can be directed to\r\n what is not there, to apprehend what is not given.\"\r\n\r\n This statement is one which, probably, most people would endorse.  But\r\n it is open to two objections.  First it is difficult to see how an\r\n activity, however un-\"transparent,\" can be directed towards a nothing:\r\na term of a relation cannot be a mere nonentity.  Secondly, no reason\r\n is given, and I am convinced that none can be given, for the assertion\r\n that dream-objects are not \"there\" and not \"given.\"  Let us take the\r\n second point first.\r\n\r\n (1) The belief that dream-objects are not given comes, I think, from\r\n failure to distinguish, as regards waking life, between the\r\n sense-datum and the corresponding \"thing.\"  In dreams, there is no such\r\n corresponding \"thing\" as the dreamer supposes;  if, therefore, the\r\n \"thing\" were given in waking life, as e.g.  Meinong maintains,[32] then\r\n there would be a difference in respect of givenness between dreams and\r\n waking life.  But if, as we have maintained, what is given is never the\r\n thing, but merely one of the \"sensibilia\" which compose the thing,\r\nthen what we apprehend in a dream is just as much given as what we\r\n apprehend in waking life.\r\n\r\n Exactly the same argument applies as to the dream-objects being\r\n \"there.\"  They have their position in the private space of the\r\n perspective of the dreamer;  where they fail is in their correlation\r\n with other private spaces and therefore with perspective space.  But in\r\n the only sense in which \"there\" can be a datum, they are \"there\" just\r\n as truly as any of the sense-data of waking life.\r\n\r\n (2) The conception of \"illusion\" or \"unreality,\" and the correlative\r\n conception of \"reality,\" are generally used in a way which embodies\r\n profound logical confusions.  Words that go in pairs, such as \"real\"\r\n and \"unreal,\" \"existent\" and \"non-existent,\" \"valid\" and \"invalid,\"\r\n etc., are all derived from the one fundamental pair, \"true\" and\r\n \"false.\"  Now \"true\" and \"false\" are applicable only—except in\r\n derivative significations—to _propositions_.  Thus wherever the above\r\n pairs can be significantly applied, we must be dealing either with\r\n propositions or with such incomplete phrases as only acquire meaning\r\n when put into a context which, with them, forms a proposition.  Thus\r\n such pairs of words can be applied to _descriptions_,[33] but not to\r\n proper names: in other words, they have no application whatever to\r\n data, but only to entities or non-entities described in terms of data.\r\n\r\n Let us illustrate by the terms \"existence\" and \"non-existence.\"  Given\r\n any datum _x_, it is meaningless either to assert or to deny that _x_\r\n \"exists.\"  We might be tempted to say: \"Of course _x_ exists, for\r\n otherwise it could not be a datum.\"  But such a statement is really\r\n meaningless, although it is significant and true to say \"My present\r\n sense-datum exists,\" and it may also be true that \"_x_ is my present\r\n sense-datum.\"  The inference from these two propositions to \"_x_\r\n exists\" is one which seems irresistible to people unaccustomed to\r\n logic;  yet the apparent proposition inferred is not merely false, but\r\n strictly meaningless.  To say \"My present sense-datum exists\" is to say\r\n (roughly): \"There is an object of which 'my present sense-datum' is a\r\n description.\"  But we cannot say: \"There is an object of which '_x_' is\r\n a description,\" because '_x_' is (in the case we are supposing) a\r\n name, not a description.  Dr. Whitehead and I have explained this point\r\n fully elsewhere (_loc.  cit. _) with the help of symbols, without which\r\n it is hard to understand;  I shall not therefore here repeat the\r\n demonstration of the above propositions, but shall proceed with their\r\n application to our present problem.\r\n\r\n The fact that \"existence\" is only applicable to descriptions is\r\n concealed by the use of what are grammatically proper names in a way\r\n which really transforms them into descriptions.  It is, for example, a\r\n legitimate question whether Homer existed;  but here \"Homer\" means\r\n \"the author of the Homeric poems,\" and is a description.  Similarly we\r\n may ask whether God exists;  but then \"God\" means \"the Supreme Being\"\r\n or \"the _ens realissimum_\" or whatever other description we may\r\n prefer.  If \"God\" were a proper name, God would have to be a datum;  and\r\n then no question could arise as to His existence.  The distinction\r\n between existence and other predicates, which Kant obscurely felt, is\r\n brought to light by the theory of descriptions, and is seen to remove\r\n \"existence\" altogether from the fundamental notions of metaphysics.\r\n\r\n What has been said about \"existence\" applies equally to \"reality,\"\r\n which may, in fact, be taken as synonymous with \"existence.\"\r\n Concerning the immediate objects in illusions, hallucinations, and\r\n dreams, it is meaningless to ask whether they \"exist\" or are \"real.\"\r\n There they are, and that ends the matter.  But we may legitimately\r\n inquire as to the existence or reality of \"things\" or other\r\n \"sensibilia\" inferred from such objects.  It is the unreality of these\r\n \"things\" and other \"sensibilia,\" together with a failure to notice\r\n that they are not data, which has led to the view that the objects of\r\n dreams are unreal.\r\n\r\n We may now apply these considerations in detail to the stock arguments\r\n against realism, though what is to be said will be mainly a repetition\r\n of what others have said before.\r\n\r\n (1) We have first the variety of normal appearances, supposed to be\r\n incompatible.  This is the case of the different shapes and colours\r\n which a given thing presents to different spectators.  Locke's water\r\n which seems both hot and cold belongs to this class of cases.  Our\r\n system of different perspectives fully accounts for these cases, and\r\n shows that they afford no argument against realism.\r\n\r\n (2) We have cases where the correlation between different senses is\r\n unusual.  The bent stick in water belongs here.  People say it looks\r\n bent but is straight: this only means that it is straight to the\r\n touch, though bent to sight.  There is no \"illusion,\" but only a false\r\n inference, if we think that the stick would feel bent to the touch.\r\n The stick would look just as bent in a photograph, and, as Mr.\r\n Gladstone used to say, \"the photograph cannot lie.\" [34] The case of\r\n seeing double also belongs here, though in this case the cause of the\r\n unusual correlation is physiological, and would therefore not operate\r\n in a photograph.  It is a mistake to ask whether the \"thing\" is\r\n duplicated when we see it double.  The \"thing\" is a whole system of\r\n \"sensibilia,\" and it is only those visual \"sensibilia\" which are data\r\n to the percipient that are duplicated.  The phenomenon has a purely\r\n physiological explanation;  indeed, in view of our having two eyes, it\r\n is in less need of explanation than the single visual sense-datum\r\n which we normally obtain from the things on which we focus.\r\n\r\n (3) We come now to cases like dreams, which may, at the moment of\r\n dreaming, contain nothing to arouse suspicion, but are condemned on the\r\n ground of their supposed incompatibility with earlier and later data.  Of\r\n course it often happens that dream-objects fail to behave in the\r\n accustomed manner: heavy objects fly, solid objects melt, babies turn\r\n into pigs or undergo even greater changes.  But none of these unusual\r\n occurrences _need_ happen in a dream, and it is not on account of such\r\n occurrences that dream-objects are called \"unreal.\"  It is their lack of\r\n continuity with the dreamer's past and future that makes him, when he\r\n wakes, condemn them;  and it is their lack of correlation with other\r\n private worlds that makes others condemn them.  Omitting the latter\r\n ground, our reason for condemning them is that the \"things\" which we\r\n infer from them cannot be combined according to the laws of physics with\r\n the \"things\" inferred from waking sense-data.  This might be used to\r\n condemn the \"things\" inferred from the data of dreams.  Dream-data are no\r\n doubt appearances of \"things,\" but not of such \"things\" as the dreamer\r\n supposes.  I have no wish to combat psychological theories of dreams,\r\nsuch as those of the psycho-analysts.  But there certainly are cases\r\n where (whatever psychological causes may contribute) the presence of\r\n physical causes also is very evident.  For instance, a door banging may\r\n produce a dream of a naval engagement, with images of battleships and\r\n sea and smoke.  The whole dream will be an appearance of the door\r\n banging, but owing to the peculiar condition of the body (especially the\r\n brain) during sleep, this appearance is not that expected to be produced\r\n by a door banging, and thus the dreamer is led to entertain false\r\n beliefs.  But his sense-data are still physical, and are such as a\r\n completed physics would include and calculate.\r\n\r\n (4) The last class of illusions are those which cannot be discovered\r\n within one person's experience, except through the discovery of\r\n discrepancies with the experiences of others.  Dreams might conceivably\r\n belong to this class, if they were jointed sufficiently neatly into\r\n waking life;  but the chief instances are recurrent sensory\r\n hallucinations of the kind that lead to insanity.  What makes the\r\n patient, in such cases, become what others call insane is the fact\r\n that, within his own experience, there is nothing to show that the\r\n hallucinatory sense-data do not have the usual kind of connection with\r\n \"sensibilia\" in other perspectives.  Of course he may learn this\r\n through testimony, but he probably finds it simpler to suppose that\r\n the testimony is untrue and that he is being wilfully deceived.  There\r\n is, so far as I can see, no theoretical criterion by which the patient\r\n can decide, in such a case, between the two equally satisfactory\r\n hypotheses of his madness and of his friends' mendacity.\r\n\r\n From the above instances it would appear that abnormal sense-data, of\r\n the kind which we regard as deceptive, have intrinsically just the\r\n same status as any others, but differ as regards their correlations or\r\n causal connections with other \"sensibilia\" and with \"things.\"  Since\r\n the usual correlations and connections become part of our unreflective\r\n expectations, and even seem, except to the psychologist, to form part\r\n of our data, it comes to be thought, mistakenly, that in such cases\r\n the data are unreal, whereas they are merely the causes of false\r\n inferences.  The fact that correlations and connections of unusual\r\n kinds occur adds to the difficulty of inferring things from sense and\r\n of expressing physics in terms of sense-data.  But the unusualness\r\n would seem to be always physically or physiologically explicable, and\r\n therefore raises only a complication, not a philosophical objection.\r\n\r\n I conclude, therefore, that no valid objection exists to the view\r\n which regards sense-data as part of the actual substance of the\r\n physical world, and that, on the other hand, this view is the only one\r\n which accounts for the empirical verifiability of physics.  In the\r\n present paper, I have given only a rough preliminary sketch.  In\r\n particular, the part played by _time_ in the construction of the\r\n physical world is, I think, more fundamental than would appear from\r\n the above account.  I should hope that, with further elaboration, the\r\n part played by unperceived \"sensibilia\" could be indefinitely\r\n diminished, probably by invoking the history of a \"thing\" to eke out\r\n the inferences derivable from its momentary appearance.\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] _Proc.

Dr. James Ward, in his _Naturalism and Agnosticism_,\r\nmakes this a ground of complaint against physics: the business of\r\n those who wish to ascertain the ultimate truth about the world, he\r\n apparently thinks, should be the discovery of causes, yet physics\r\n never even seeks them.  To me it seems that philosophy ought not to\r\n assume such legislative functions, and that the reason why physics has\r\n ceased to look for causes is that, in fact, there are no such things.\r\n The law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among\r\n philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the\r\n monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.  In\r\n order to find out what philosophers commonly understand by \"cause,\" I\r\n consulted Baldwin's _Dictionary_, and was rewarded beyond my\r\n expectations, for I found the following three mutually incompatible\r\n definitions:—\r\n\r\n \"CAUSALITY.  (1) The necessary connection of events in the\r\n time-series....\r\n\r\n \"CAUSE (notion of).  Whatever may be included in the thought or\r\n perception of a process as taking place in consequence of\r\n another process....\r\n\r\n \"CAUSE AND EFFECT.  (1) Cause and effect ... are correlative terms\r\n denoting any two distinguishable things, phases, or aspects of\r\n reality, which are so related to each other that whenever the\r\n first ceases to exist the second comes into existence\r\n immediately after, and whenever the second comes into existence\r\n"

If the simplest formula ceases, after a\r\n time, to be applicable, the simplest formula that remains applicable\r\n is selected, and science has no sense that an axiom has been\r\n falsified.  We are thus left with the brute fact that, in many\r\n departments of science, quite simple laws have hitherto been found to\r\n hold.  This fact cannot be regarded as having any _a priori_ ground,\r\nnor can it be used to support inductively the opinion that the same\r\n laws will continue;  for at every moment laws hitherto true are being\r\n falsified, though in the advanced sciences these laws are less simple\r\n than those that have remained true.  Moreover it would be fallacious to\r\n argue inductively from the state of the advanced sciences to the\r\n future state of the others, for it may well be that the advanced\r\n sciences are advanced simply because, hitherto, their subject-matter\r\n has obeyed simple and easily ascertainable laws, while the\r\n subject-matter of other sciences has not done so.\r\n\r\n The difficulty we have been considering seems to be met partly, if not\r\n wholly, by the principle that the _time_ must not enter explicitly\r\n into our formulæ.  All mechanical laws exhibit acceleration as a\r\n function of configuration, not of configuration and time jointly;  and\r\n this principle of the irrelevance of the time may be extended to all\r\n scientific laws.  In fact we might interpret the \"uniformity of nature\"\r\n as meaning just this, that no scientific law involves the time as an\r\n argument, unless, of course, it is given in an integrated form, in\r\n which case _lapse_ of time, though not absolute time, may appear in\r\n our formulæ.  Whether this consideration suffices to overcome our\r\n difficulty completely, I do not know;  but in any case it does much to\r\n diminish it.\r\n\r\n It will serve to illustrate what has been said if we apply it to the\r\n question of free will.\r\n\r\n (1) Determinism in regard to the will is the doctrine that our\r\n volitions belong to some deterministic system, i.e. are \"determined\"\r\n in the sense defined above.  Whether this doctrine is true or false, is\r\n a mere question of fact;  no _a priori_ considerations (if our previous\r\n discussions have been correct) can exist on either side.  On the one\r\n hand, there is no _a priori_ category of causality, but merely certain\r\n observed uniformities.  As a matter of fact, there are observed\r\n uniformities in regard to volitions;  thus there is some empirical\r\n evidence that volitions are determined.  But it would be very rash to\r\n maintain that the evidence is overwhelming, and it is quite possible\r\n that some volitions, as well as some other things, are not determined,\r\nexcept in the sense in which we found that everything must be\r\n determined.\r\n\r\n (2) But, on the other hand, the subjective sense of freedom, sometimes\r\n alleged against determinism, has no bearing on the question whatever.\r\n The view that it has a bearing rests upon the belief that causes\r\n compel their effects, or that nature enforces obedience to its laws as\r\n governments do.  These are mere anthropomorphic superstitions, due to\r\n assimilation of causes with volitions and of natural laws with human\r\n edicts.  We feel that our will is not compelled, but that only means\r\n that it is not other than we choose it to be.  It is one of the\r\n demerits of the traditional theory of causality that it has created an\r\n artificial opposition between determinism and the freedom of which we\r\n are introspectively conscious.\r\n\r\n (3) Besides the general question whether volitions are determined,\r\nthere is the further question whether they are _mechanically_\r\n determined, i.e. whether they are part of what was above defined as a\r\n mechanical system.  This is the question whether they form part of a\r\n system with purely material determinants, i.e. whether there are laws\r\n which, given certain material data, make all volitions functions of\r\n those data.  Here again, there is empirical evidence up to a point, but\r\n it is not conclusive in regard to all volitions.  It is important to\r\n observe, however that even if volitions are part of a mechanical\r\n system, this by no means implies any supremacy of matter over mind.  It\r\n may well be that the same system which is susceptible of material\r\n determinants is also susceptible of mental determinants;  thus a\r\n mechanical system may be determined by sets of volitions, as well as\r\n by sets of material facts.  It would seem, therefore, that the reasons\r\n which make people dislike the view that volitions are mechanically\r\n determined are fallacious.\r\n\r\n (4) The notion of _necessity_, which is often associated with\r\n determinism, is a confused notion not legitimately deducible from\r\n determinism.  Three meanings are commonly confounded when necessity is\r\n spoken of:—\r\n\r\n (α) An _action_ is necessary when it will be performed however much\r\n the agent may wish to do otherwise.  Determinism does not imply that\r\n actions are necessary in this sense.\r\n\r\n (β) A _propositional function_ is necessary when all its values are\r\n true.  This sense is not relevant to our present discussion.\r\n\r\n (γ) A _proposition_ is necessary with respect to a given constituent\r\n when it is the value, with that constituent as argument, of a\r\n necessary propositional function, in other words, when it remains true\r\n however that constituent may be varied.  In this sense, in a\r\n deterministic system, the connection of a volition with its\r\n determinants is necessary, if the time at which the determinants occur\r\n be taken as the constituent to be varied, the time-interval between\r\n the determinants and the volition being kept constant.  But this sense\r\n of necessity is purely logical, and has no emotional importance.\r\n\r\n We may now sum up our discussion of causality.  We found first that the\r\n law of causality, as usually stated by philosophers, is false, and is\r\n not employed in science.  We then considered the nature of scientific\r\n laws, and found that, instead of stating that one event A is always\r\n followed by another event B, they stated functional relations between\r\n certain events at certain times, which we called determinants, and\r\n other events at earlier or later times or at the same time.  We were\r\n unable to find any _a priori_ category involved: the existence of\r\n scientific laws appeared as a purely empirical fact, not necessarily\r\n universal, except in a trivial and scientifically useless form.  We\r\n found that a system with one set of determinants may very likely have\r\n other sets of a quite different kind, that, for example, a\r\n mechanically determined system may also be teleologically or\r\n volitionally determined.  Finally we considered the problem of free\r\n will: here we found that the reasons for supposing volitions to be\r\n determined are strong but not conclusive, and we decided that even if\r\n volitions are mechanically determined, that is no reason for denying\r\n freedom in the sense revealed by introspection, or for supposing that\r\n mechanical events are not determined by volitions.  The problem of free\r\n will _versus_ determinism is therefore, if we were right, mainly\r\n illusory, but in part not yet capable of being decisively solved.\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] A propositional function is an expression containing a variable,\r\nor undetermined constituent, and becoming a proposition as soon as a\r\n definite value is assigned to the variable.  Examples are: \"A is A,\"\r\n \"_x_ is a number.\"  The variable is called the _argument_ of the\r\n function.\r\n\r\n [36] _Logic_, Bk.  III, Chap.  V, § 2.\r\n\r\n [37] _Time and Free Will_, p. 199.\r\n\r\n [38] _Time and Free Will. _ p. 202.\r\n\r\n [39] _Loc.  cit. _, § 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n X\r\n\r\n KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n The object of the following paper is to consider what it is that we\r\n know in cases where we know propositions about \"the so-and-so\" without\r\n knowing who or what the so-and-so is.  For example, I know that the\r\n candidate who gets most votes will be elected, though I do not know\r\n who is the candidate who will get most votes.  The problem I wish to\r\n consider is: What do we know in these cases, where the subject is\r\n merely described?  I have considered this problem elsewhere[40] from a\r\n purely logical point of view;  but in what follows I wish to consider\r\n the question in relation to theory of knowledge as well as in relation\r\n to logic, and in view of the above-mentioned logical discussions, I\r\n shall in this paper make the logical portion as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n In order to make clear the antithesis between \"acquaintance\" and\r\n \"description,\" I shall first of all try to explain what I mean by\r\n \"acquaintance.\"  I say that I am _acquainted_ with an object when I\r\n have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am\r\n directly aware of the object itself.  When I speak of a cognitive\r\n relation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\r\n judgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation.  In fact, I\r\n think the relation of subject and object which I call acquaintance is\r\n simply the converse of the relation of object and subject which\r\n constitutes presentation.  That is, to say that S has acquaintance with\r\n O is essentially the same thing as to say that O is presented to S.\r\n But the associations and natural extensions of the word _acquaintance_\r\n are different from those of the word _presentation_.  To begin with, as\r\n in most cognitive words, it is natural to say that I am acquainted\r\n with an object even at moments when it is not actually before my mind,\r\nprovided it has been before my mind, and will be again whenever\r\n occasion arises.  This is the same sense in which I am said to know\r\n that 2+2=4 even when I am thinking of something else.  In the second\r\n place, the word _acquaintance_ is designed to emphasise, more than the\r\n word _presentation_, the relational character of the fact with which\r\n we are concerned.  There is, to my mind, a danger that, in speaking of\r\n presentation, we may so emphasise the object as to lose sight of the\r\n subject.  The result of this is either to lead to the view that there\r\n is no subject, whence we arrive at materialism;  or to lead to the view\r\n that what is presented is part of the subject, whence we arrive at\r\n idealism, and should arrive at solipsism but for the most desperate\r\n contortions.  Now I wish to preserve the dualism of subject and object\r\n in my terminology, because this dualism seems to me a fundamental fact\r\n concerning cognition.  Hence I prefer the word _acquaintance_ because\r\n it emphasises the need of a subject which is acquainted.\r\n\r\n When we ask what are the kinds of objects with which we are\r\n acquainted, the first and most obvious example is _sense-data_.  When I\r\n see a colour or hear a noise, I have direct acquaintance with the\r\n colour or the noise.  The sense-datum with which I am acquainted in\r\n these cases is generally, if not always, complex.  This is\r\n particularly obvious in the case of sight.  I do not mean, of course,\r\nmerely that the supposed physical object is complex, but that the\r\n direct sensible object is complex and contains parts with spatial\r\n relations.  Whether it is possible to be aware of a complex without\r\n being aware of its constituents is not an easy question, but on the\r\n whole it would seem that there is no reason why it should not be\r\n possible.  This question arises in an acute form in connection with\r\n self-consciousness, which we must now briefly consider.\r\n\r\n In introspection, we seem to be immediately aware of varying\r\n complexes, consisting of objects in various cognitive and conative\r\n relations to ourselves.  When I see the sun, it often happens that I\r\n am aware of my seeing the sun, in addition to being aware of the sun;\r\n and when I desire food, it often happens that I am aware of my desire\r\n for food.  But it is hard to discover any state of mind in which I am\r\n aware of myself alone, as opposed to a complex of which I am a\r\n constituent.  The question of the nature of self-consciousness is too\r\n large and too slightly connected with our subject, to be argued at\r\n length here.  It is difficult, but probably not impossible, to account\r\n for plain facts if we assume that we do not have acquaintance with\r\n ourselves.  It is plain that we are not only _acquainted_ with the\r\n complex \"Self-acquainted-with-A,\" but we also _know_ the proposition\r\n \"I am acquainted with A.\" Now here the complex has been analysed, and\r\n if \"I\" does not stand for something which is a direct object of\r\n acquaintance, we shall have to suppose that \"I\" is something known by\r\n description.  If we wished to maintain the view that there is no\r\n acquaintance with Self, we might argue as follows: We are acquainted\r\n with _acquaintance_, and we know that it is a relation.  Also we are\r\n acquainted with a complex in which we perceive that acquaintance is\r\n the relating relation.  Hence we know that this complex must have a\r\n constituent which is that which is acquainted, i.e. must have a\r\n subject-term as well as an object-term.  This subject-term we define\r\n as \"I.\"  Thus \"I\" means \"the subject-term in awarenesses of which _I_\r\n am aware.\"  But as a definition this cannot be regarded as a happy\r\n effort.  It would seem necessary, therefore, either to suppose that I\r\n am acquainted with myself, and that \"I,\" therefore, requires no\r\n definition, being merely the proper name of a certain object, or to\r\n find some other analysis of self-consciousness.  Thus self-consciousness\r\n cannot be regarded as throwing light on the question whether we can\r\n know a complex without knowing its constituents.  This question,\r\nhowever, is not important for our present purposes, and I shall\r\n therefore not discuss it further.\r\n\r\n The awarenesses we have considered so far have all been awarenesses of\r\n particular existents, and might all in a large sense be called\r\n sense-data.  For, from the point of view of theory of knowledge,\r\nintrospective knowledge is exactly on a level with knowledge derived\r\n from sight or hearing.  But, in addition to awareness of the above kind\r\n of objects, which may be called awareness of _particulars_;  we have\r\n also (though not quite in the same sense) what may be called awareness\r\n of _universals_.  Awareness of universals is called _conceiving_, and a\r\n universal of which we are aware is called a _concept_.  Not only are we\r\n aware of particular yellows, but if we have seen a sufficient number\r\n of yellows and have sufficient intelligence, we are aware of the\r\n universal _yellow_;  this universal is the subject in such judgments as\r\n \"yellow differs from blue\" or \"yellow resembles blue less than green\r\n does.\"  And the universal yellow is the predicate in such judgments as\r\n \"this is yellow,\" where \"this\" is a particular sense-datum.  And\r\n universal relations, too, are objects of awarenesses;  up and down,\r\nbefore and after, resemblance, desire, awareness itself, and so on,\r\nwould seem to be all of them objects of which we can be aware.\r\n\r\n In regard to relations, it might be urged that we are never aware of\r\n the universal relation itself, but only of complexes in which it is a\r\n constituent.  For example, it may be said that we do not know directly\r\n such a relation as _before_, though we understand such a proposition\r\n as \"this is before that,\" and may be directly aware of such a complex\r\n as \"this being before that.\"  This view, however, is difficult to\r\n reconcile with the fact that we often know propositions in which the\r\n relation is the subject, or in which the relata are not definite given\r\n objects, but \"anything.\"  For example, we know that if one thing is\r\n before another, and the other before a third, then the first is before\r\n the third;  and here the things concerned are not definite things, but\r\n \"anything.\"  It is hard to see how we could know such a fact about\r\n \"before\" unless we were acquainted with \"before,\" and not merely with\r\n actual particular cases of one given object being before another given\r\n object.  And more directly: A judgment such as \"this is before that,\"\r\n where this judgment is derived from awareness of a complex,\r\nconstitutes an analysis, and we should not understand the analysis if\r\n we were not acquainted with the meaning of the terms employed.  Thus we\r\n must suppose that we are acquainted with the meaning of \"before,\" and\r\n not merely with instances of it.\r\n\r\n There are thus at least two sorts of objects of which we are aware,\r\nnamely, particulars and universals.  Among particulars I include all\r\n existents, and all complexes of which one or more constituents are\r\n existents, such as this-before-that, this-above-that,\r\nthe-yellowness-of-this.  Among universals I include all objects of\r\n which no particular is a constituent.  Thus the disjunction\r\n \"universal-particular\" includes all objects.  We might also call it the\r\n disjunction \"abstract-concrete.\"  It is not quite parallel with the\r\n opposition \"concept-percept,\" because things remembered or imagined\r\n belong with particulars, but can hardly be called percepts.  (On the\r\n other hand, universals with which we are acquainted may be identified\r\n with concepts.)\r\n\r\n"
