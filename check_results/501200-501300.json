        "text":" Introduction\r\n\r\n Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal.  The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\r\n\r\n Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as \"historical\" in the children's library;  for the time has come for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality;  therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\n Having this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n L. Frank Baum \r\n Chicago, April, 1900."

        "text":"1.  The Cyclone\r\n\r\n Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room;  and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar — except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.\r\n\r\n When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\r\n\r\n When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun and wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray;  they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached her ears;  and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\n Uncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\r\n\r\n It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray;  he was a little black dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\r\n\r\n Today, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\r\n\r\n From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.\r\n\r\n Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\r\n\r\n \"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife.  \"I'll go look after the stock.\"  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.\r\n\r\n Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of the danger close at hand.\r\n\r\n \"Quick, Dorothy!\"  she screamed.  \"Run for the cellar!\"\r\n\r\n Toto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl started to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.  When she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.\r\n\r\n Then a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\n The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\r\n\r\n The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact center of the cyclone.  In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone;  and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather.\r\n\r\n It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found she was riding quite easily.  After the first few whirls around, and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\r\n\r\n Toto did not like it.  He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking loudly;  but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen.\r\n\r\n Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in;  and at first the little girl thought she had lost him.  But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall.  She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\r\n\r\n Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;  but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf.  At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again;  but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring.  At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it;  and Toto followed and lay down beside her.\r\n\r\n In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep."

        "text":"After breakfast, Marten began teaching Tempi and me how to search for the bandits’ trail.\r\n Anyone can spot a piece of torn shirt hanging from a branch or a footprint gouged into the dirt, but those things never happen in real life.  They make for convenient plot devices in plays, but really, when have you ever torn your clothing so seriously that you’ve left a piece of it behind?\r\n Never.  The people we were hunting were clever, so we couldn’t count on them making any obvious mistakes.  That meant Marten was the only one among us who had any idea what we were really looking for.\r\n “Any broken twig,” he said.  “They’ll mostly be where things are thick and tangled: waist high or ankle high.”  He gestured as if kicking through thick scrub and pushing things aside with his hands.  “Seeing the actual break is hard, so look at the leaves instead.”  He gestured to a nearby bush.  “What do you see there?”\r\n Tempi pointed at a lower branch.  He wore his plain grey homespun today, and without his mercenary reds, he looked even less imposing.\r\n I looked where Tempi was pointing and saw the branch had been snapped, but not badly enough to break off.\r\n “So someone has been through here?”  I asked.\r\n Marten shrugged his bow higher up on his shoulder.  “I was.  I did this last night.”  He looked at us.  “See how even the leaves that aren’t hanging strange are starting to wilt?\r\n I nodded.\r\n “That means someone has been by this way within a day or so.  If it’s been two or three days, the leaves will brown out and die.  You see both close to each other . .  .”  He looked at me.\r\n “It means you have someone moving through the area more than once, days apart.”\r\n He nodded.  “Since I’m scouting and keeping an eye out for bandits, you’ll be the ones with your noses to the ground.  When you find something like this, call me.”\r\n “Call?”  Tempi cupped his hands around his mouth and turned his head in different directions.  He made a wide gesture to the surrounding trees and put his hand to his ear, pretending to listen.\r\n Marten frowned.  “You’re right.  You can’t just go shouting for me.”  He rubbed the back of his neck in frustration.  “Damn, we didn’t think this all the way through.”\r\n I smiled at him.  “I thought it through,” I said, and brought out a rough wooden whistle I’d carved last night.  It only had two notes, but that was all we needed.  I put it to my mouth and blew.  Ta-ta DEE.  Ta-ta DEE.\r\n Marten grinned.  “That’s a Will’s Widow, isn’t it?  The pitch is dead on.”\r\n I nodded.  “That’s what I do.”\r\n He cleared his throat.  “Unfortunately, Will’s Widow is also called a night-jar.”  He grimaced apologetically.  “Night-jar, mind you.  That’ll catch at the ear of any experienced woodsman like a fishhook if you go blowing it every time you want me to come take a look at something.”\r\n I looked down at the whistle.  “Black hands,” I swore.  “I should have thought of that.”\r\n “It’s a good idea,” he said.  “We just need one for a daytime bird.  Maybe a gold piper.”  He whistled two notes.  “That should be simple enough.”\r\n “I’ll carve a different one tonight,” I said, then reached down for a twig.  I snapped it and handed half to Marten.  “This will do if I need to signal you today.”\r\n He looked at the stick oddly.  “How exactly will this help?”\r\n “When we need your opinion on something we’ve found, I’ll do this.”  I concentrated, muttered a binding, and moved my half of the stick.\r\n Marten jumped two feet up and five feet back, dropping the stick.  To his credit, he didn’t shout.  “What in ten hells was that?”  he hissed, wringing his hand.\r\n His reaction had startled me, and my own heart was racing.  “Marten, I’m sorry.  It’s just a little sympathy.”  I saw a wrinkle in between his eyebrows and changed my tack.  “Just a small magic.  It’s like a bit of magic string I use to tie two things together.”\r\n I imagined Elxa Dal swallowing his tongue at this description, but pressed ahead.  “I can tie these things together, so when I tug on mine . .  .”  I moved to stand over where his half of the twig lay on the ground.  I raised my half, and the half on the ground lifted into the air.\r\n My display had the desired effect.  Moving together, the two twigs looked like the crudest, saddest string puppet in the world.  Nothing to be frightened of.  “It’s just like invisible string, except it won’t get tangled or caught on anything.”\r\n “How hard will it pull at me?”  he asked warily.  “I don’t want it yanking me out of a tree when I’m scouting.”\r\n “It’s just me on the other end of the string,” I said.  “I’ll just jiggle it a bit.  Like the float on a fishing line.”\r\n Marten stopped wringing his hand and relaxed a little.  “Startled me is all,” he said.\r\n “That’s my fault,” I said.  “I should have warned you.”  I picked up the stick, handling it with a deliberate casualness.  As if it were nothing more than an ordinary stick.  Of course it was nothing more than an ordinary stick, but Marten needed to be reassured as to that point.  It’s like Teccam said, nothing in the world is harder than convincing someone of an unfamiliar truth.\r\n\r\n Marten showed us how to see when leaves or needles had been disturbed, how to spot when stones had been walked across, how to tell if moss or lichen had been damaged by someone’s passing.\r\n The old huntsman was a surprisingly good teacher.  He didn’t belabor his points, didn’t talk down to us, and didn’t mind questions.  Even Tempi’s trouble with the language didn’t frustrate him.\r\n Even so, it took hours.  A full half day.  Then, when I thought we were finally finished, Marten turned us around and started leading us back toward the camp.\r\n “We’ve already been that way,” I said.  “If we’re going to practice, let’s practice in the right direction.”\r\n Marten ignored me and kept walking.  “Tell me what you see.”\r\n Twenty paces later, Tempi pointed.  “Moss,” he said.  “My foot.  I walked.”\r\n Realization dawned, and I began to see all the marks Tempi and I had made.  For the next three hours, Marten walked us step by humiliating step back through the trees, showing us everything we had done to betray our presence there: a scuff against the lichen on a tree trunk, a piece of freshly broken rock, the discoloration of overturned pine needles.\r\n Worst of all were a half-dozen bright green leaves that lay shredded on the ground in a tidy semicircle.  Marten raised an eyebrow, and I blushed.  I had plucked them from a nearby bush, idly shredding them while listening to Marten.\r\n “Think twice and step carefully,” Marten said.  “And keep an eye on each other.”  He looked back and forth between Tempi and me.  “We’re playing a dangerous game here.”\r\n Then Marten showed us how to cover our tracks.  It quickly became clear that a poorly concealed sign was often more obvious than one simply left alone.  So over the next two hours we learned how to hide our mistakes and spot mistakes that others had tried to hide.\r\n Only then, as afternoon was turning to evening, did Tempi and I begin searching this swath of forest bigger than most baronies.  We walked close together, zigzagging back and forth, looking for any sign of the bandits’ trail.\r\n I thought about the long days stretching out ahead of us.  I’d thought searching the Archives had been tedious.  But looking for a broken twig in this much forest made hunting for the gram seem like going to the baker for a bun.\r\n In the Archives I had the chance to make accidental discoveries.  In the Archives I’d had my friends: conversation, jokes, affection.  Looking sideways at Tempi, I realized I could count the words he had said today: twenty-four, and the number of times he had met my eye: three.\r\n How long would this take?  Ten days?  Twenty?  Merciful Tehlu, could I spend a month out here without going mad?\r\n With thoughts like this, when I saw some bark chipped off a tree and a tuft of grass bent the wrong way, I was flooded with relief.\r\n Not wanting to get my hopes up, I motioned to Tempi.  “Do you see anything here?”  He nodded, fidgeting with the collar of his shirt, then pointed to the grass I’d spotted.  Then he pointed to a scuffed bit of exposed root I hadn’t noticed.\r\n Almost light-headed with excitement, I pulled out the oak twig and signaled Marten.  I twitched it very gently, not wanting to send him into another panic.\r\n It was only two minutes before Marten came out of the trees, but in that time, I had already formed three plans as to how to track and kill the bandits, composed five apologetic soliloquies to Denna, and decided that when I got back to Severen, I would donate money to the Tehlin church as thanks for this tangible miracle.\r\n I expected Marten to be irritated that we’d called him back so soon.  But his expression was purely matter-of-fact as he came to stand next to us.\r\n I pointed out the grass, the bark, and the root.  “Tempi spotted the last.”  I said, giving credit where credit is due.\r\n “Good,” he said seriously.  “Good job.  There’s also a bent branch over there.”  He gestured a few paces off to the right.\r\n I turned to face the direction the trail seemed to indicate.  “Odds are they’re going to be north of here,” I said.  “Farther from the road.  Do you think it would be better to scout things out a bit now, or wait until tomorrow when we’re fresh?”\r\n Marten squinted at me.  “Good lord, boy.  These aren’t real trail signs.  So obvious, all so close together.”  He gave me a long look.  “I left them.  I needed to make sure you weren’t going to glaze over after a few minutes of looking.”\r\n My elation fell from some place in my chest and landed around my feet, shattering like a glass jar tipped from a high shelf.  My expression must have been pitiful, as Marten gave me an apologetic smile.  “I’m sorry.  I should have told you.  I’ll be doing it off and on every day.  It’s the only chance we have to stay alert.  This isn’t my first time hunting through haystacks, you know.”\r\n\r\n The third time we called Martin back, he suggested we make a standing wager.  Tempi and I would win a ha’penny for every sign we found, and he’d win a silver bit for every one we missed.  I jumped at the offer.  Not only would it help keep us on our toes, but five-to-one odds seemed rather generous.\r\n This made the rest of the day pass quickly. "

The programme, moreover, was augmented by the inclusion of Association football (which appeared in 1900 but only in a demonstration match), diving, field hockey, and ice hockey, as well as other sports since discontinued.  The most dramatic episode of these Games was in the marathon, run from Windsor to Shepherd's Bush in London, the site of a new stadium.  Pietri (Italy) led into the arena but collapsed and was disqualified for accepting assistance from officials.  The gold medal went to the second man home, Hayes (USA), but Queen Alexandra, who was present opposite the finishing line, was so moved by the Italian's plight that she awarded him special gold cup.  The 400 metres provided an opportunity for Halswelle (GB) to become the only man in Olympic history to win by a walk-over.  The final was declared void after an American had been disqualified for boring.  Two other Americans withdrew from re-run final in protest, leaving Halswelle an unopposed passage.  Britain won the polo, and all the boxing, lawn tennis, rackets, rowing, and yachting titles as well as five out of six cycle races."

The Olympic Games began in Olympia nearly 1,200 years ago in Olympia.  They were for men only.  In 1896 the first International Olympic Games were organized in Olympia.  The Games opening ceremony is celebrated by lighting a flame called the \"Olympic flame\".  The Olympic motto is \"Faster, Higher, Stronger.\"  The Olympic symbol is five interlocking circles colored blue, yellow, black, green and red.  In 1980 the Olympic Games were organized in our country in the Moscow.  The first Winter Olympic Games were hold in France in the city Shamoni in 1924.  Last Winter Olympic Games were hold in the USA in the Salt-Lake city, state UTA from 8th to 24th February 2002.  Russian athletes took part in this sports competition.  Russia won all in all 16 medals (6 gold, 6 silver, 4 bronze).  It is the 4th result.  The first result achieved Germany with 35 medals.\r\n\r\n Sport is a very important part of life in Great Britain.  The most popular of the team games are football and cricket, and the most popular individual game is lawn tennis.\r\n\r\n Rugby.  One type of football, in which the players carried the oval ball in their hands, appeared 140 years ago at Rugby School.  That is why the game took the name of Rugby, or \"rugger\".  The rules of the game are different from football, and there are 15 players instead of 11, in a team.\r\n\r\n Cricket.  Cricket is England's national summer game.  Nobody knows exactly how old the game is.  Most matches last one day, but important matches (such as international ones) can last six days.  In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all villages and towns have their cricket teams which play regularly at least one match a week during the season - from May to September.\r\n\r\n Lawn tennis.  The number of people who can play lawn tennis is great.  The tennis championships held at Wimbledon.\r\n\r\n Swimming.  Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.  There are also indoor swimming pools, which makes swimming possible all-the-year-round."

But what surprised me more were the results from poor provinces that came out really well.  The levels of resilience are just incredible.\r\n \"In China, the idea is so deeply rooted that education is the key to mobility and success.\"\r\n\r\n Education's World Cup\r\n\r\n This year will see another round of Pisa tests - it's like World Cup year for international education.  And Mr Schleicher's tips for the next fast-improving countries are Brazil, Turkey and Poland.\r\n\r\n Pisa tests are taken by 15-year-olds in reading, maths and science.  Previous leaders in these subjects:\r\n\r\n2000: Finland, Japan, South Korea\r\n 2003: Finland, Hong Kong, Finland\r\n 2006: South Korea, Taipei, Finland\r\n 2009: Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai\r\n\r\n Mr Schleicher, a German based in the OECD's Paris headquarters, has become the godfather of such global education comparisons.\r\n Armed with a spreadsheet and an impeccably polite manner, his opinions receive close attention in the world's education departments.\r\n The White House responded to the last Pisa results with President Barack Obama's observation that the nation which \"out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow\".\r\n The next round of global league tables will test 500,000 pupils in more than 70 countries - with the results to be published late next year.\r\n Education ministers will be looking nervously at the outcome.\r\n \"In the past, politicians could always say we're doing better than last year - everyone could be a success,\" he says, describing the tendency for national results to rise each year.\r\n The arrival of Pisa tests sent an icy draught through these insulated corridors.\r\n\r\n No excuses\r\n\r\n Perhaps the biggest discomfort of all was for Germany - where \"Pisa shock\" described the discovery that their much vaunted education system was distinctly average.\r\n Finland was the education world leader in rankings a decade ago\r\n And the biggest change in attitude, he says, has been the United States - once with no interest in looking abroad, now enthusiastically borrowing ideas from other countries.\r\n \"Education is a field dominated by beliefs and traditions, it's inward looking.  As a system you can find all kinds of excuses and explanations for not succeeding.\r\n \"The idea of Pisa was to take away all the excuses.\r\n \"People say you can only improve an education system over 25 years - but look at Poland and Singapore, which have improved in a very short time, we've seen dramatic changes.\"\r\n The biggest lesson of the Pisa tests, he says, is showing there is nothing inevitable about how schools perform.\r\n \"Poverty is no longer destiny.

On his way, he received a teledram from the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen: \"I'm going South.\"\r\n\r\n During the polar summer of 1910-11, both teams organised food depots in preparation for their expeditions.\r\n\r\n Amundsen was the first to leave, on 16 October, 1911.  He had teams of dogs pulling the sledges and all his men were on skis.  Because of this, he made rapid progress.  Scott left on 1 November and soon had problems.  His two motor sledges broke down.  Amundsen reached the Pole on 14 December and put a Norwegian flag there.  Scott finally arrived at the Pole with his men on 17 January.  They were devastated when they saw Norwegian flag.\r\n\r\n The return journey was one of the worst in the history of exploration.  The men were exhausted and were running out of food.  Captain Oates and Edgar Evans died in spite of terrible frostbite.  After their death Scott and two men carried on and got within eleven miles of one of their food depots.  But then a terrible storm started and they could not leave their tent.  Scott spent some of his last hours writing letter to his wife.\r\n\r\n The news of Scott`s death shocked the world.  The remarkable courage shown by Captain Scott and his men made them into heroes."

        "text":"“Manet never mentioned that,” I said.\r\n Basil gave an apologetic grimace.  “Old Manet is a workhorse,” he said politely.  “But he’s not the most innovative fellow around.  He’s been here, what, thirty years?  I don’t think he has a single schema to his name.”  He flipped through the book a bit, scanning the pages.  “Most serious artificers have at least one just as a point of pride, even if it’s something fairly useless.”\r\n Numbers spun in my head.  “So ten percent of eight talents each,” I murmured, then looked up.  “I’ve got twenty-two talents waiting for me?”\r\n Basil nodded, looking at the entry in the book.  “Twenty-two and four,” he said, bringing out a pencil and a piece of paper.  “You want all of it?”\r\n I grinned.\r\n\r\n When I set out for Imre my purse was so heavy I feared I might develop a limp.  I stopped by Anker’s and picked up my travelsack, resting it on my opposite shoulder to balance things out.\r\n I wandered through town, idly passing by all the places Denna and I had frequented in the past.  I wondered where in the world she might be.\r\n After my ritual search was complete, I made my way to a back alley that smelled of rancid fat and climbed a set of narrow stairs.  I knocked briskly on Devi’s door, waited for a long minute, then knocked again, louder.\r\n There was the sound of a bolt being thrown and a lock turning.  The door cracked open and a single pale blue eye peered out at me.  I grinned.\r\n The door swung open slowly.  Devi stood in the doorway, staring blankly at me, her arms at her sides.\r\n I raised an eyebrow at her.  “What?”  I said.  “No witty banter?”\r\n “I don’t do business on the landing,” she said automatically.  Her voice was absolutely without inflection.  “You’ll have to come inside.”\r\n I waited, but she didn’t step out of the doorway.  I could smell cinnamon and honey wafting out from the room behind her.\r\n “Devi?”  I asked.  “Are you okay?”\r\n “You’re a . .  .”  She trailed off, still staring at me.  Her voice was flat and emotionless.  “You’re supposed to be dead.”\r\n “In this and many other things, I aim to disappoint,” I said.\r\n “I was sure he’d done it,” Devi continued.  “His father’s barony is called the Pirate Isles.  I was sure he’d done it because we’d set fire to his rooms.  I was the one that actually set the fire, but he couldn’t know that.  You were the only one he saw.  You and that Cealdish fellow.”\r\n Devi looked up at me, blinking in the light.  The pixie-faced gaelet had always been fair-skinned, but this was the first time I’d ever seen her look pale.  “You’re taller,” she said.  “I’d almost forgotten how tall you are.”\r\n “I almost forgot how pretty you are,” I said.  “But I couldn’t quite manage it.”\r\n Devi continued to stand in the doorway, pale and staring.  Concerned, I stepped forward and laid my hand lightly on her arm.  She didn’t pull away as I half-expected.  She simply looked down at my hand.\r\n “I’m waiting for a quip here,” I teased gently.  “You’re usually quicker than this.”\r\n “I don’t think I can match wits with you right now,” she said.\r\n “I never suspected you could match wits with me,” I said.  “But I do like a little banter now and then.”\r\n Devi gave a ghost of a smile, a little color coming back to her cheeks.  “You’re a horse’s ass,” she said.\r\n “That’s more like it,” I said encouragingly as I drew her out of the doorway into the bright autumn afternoon.  “I knew you had it in you.”\r\n\r\n The two of us walked to a nearby inn, and with the help of a short beer and long lunch, Devi recovered from the shock of seeing me alive.  Soon she was her usual sharp-tongued self again, and we bantered back and forth over mugs of spiced cider.\r\n Afterward we strolled back to her rooms behind the butcher shop, where Devi discovered she’d forgotten to lock her door.\r\n “Merciful Tehlu,” she said, once we were inside, looking around frantically.  “That’s a first.”\r\n Looking around, I saw that little had changed in her rooms since I’d last seen them, though her second set of bookshelves was almost half full.  I looked over the titles as Devi searched the other rooms to make sure nothing was missing.\r\n “Anything you’d like to borrow?”  she asked, as she came back into the room.\r\n “Actually,” I said, “I have something for you.”\r\n I set my travelsack on her desk and rooted around until I found a flat rectangular package wrapped in oilskin and tied with twine.  I moved my travelsack onto the floor and put the package on the desk, nudging it toward her.\r\n Devi approached the desk wearing a dubious expression, then sat down and unwrapped the parcel.  Inside was the copy of Celum Tinture I’d stolen from Caudicus’ library.  Not a particularly rare book, but a useful resource for an alchemist exiled from the Archives.  Not that I knew anything about alchemy, of course.\r\n Devi looked down at it.  “And what’s this for?”  she asked.\r\n I laughed.  “It’s a present.”\r\n She eyed me narrowly.  “If you think this will get you an extension on your loan. . .  .”\r\n I shook my head.  “I just thought you’d like it,” I said.  “As for the loan . .  .”  I brought out my purse and counted nine thick talents onto her desk.\r\n “Well then,” Devi said, mildly surprised.  “It looks like someone had a profitable trip.”  She looked up at me.  “Are you sure you don’t want to wait until after you’ve paid tuition?”\r\n “Already taken care of,” I said.\r\n Devi made no move to take the money.  “I wouldn’t want to leave you penniless at the start of the new term,” she said.\r\n I hefted my purse in one hand.  It clinked with a delightful fullness that was almost musical.\r\n Devi brought out a key and unlocked a drawer at the bottom of her desk.  One by one she brought out my copy of Rhetoric and Logic, my talent pipes, my sympathy lamp, and Denna’s ring.\r\n She piled them neatly on her desk, but still didn’t reach for the coins.  “You still have two months before your year and a day is up,” she said.  “Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer to wait?”\r\n Puzzled, I looked down at the money on the table, then around at Devi’s rooms.  Realization came to me like a flower unfurling in my head.  “This isn’t about the money at all, is it?”  I said, amazed it had taken me this long to figure it out.\r\n Devi cocked her head to the side.\r\n I gestured at the bookshelves, the large velvet-curtained bed, at Devi herself.  I’d never noticed before, but while her clothes weren’t fancy, the cut and cloth were fine as any noble’s.\r\n “This doesn’t have anything to do with money,” I repeated.  I looked at her books.  Her collection had to be worth five hundred talents if it was worth a penny.  “You use the money as bait.  You lend it out to desperate folks who might be useful to you, then hope they can’t pay you back.  Your real business is favors.”\r\n Devi chuckled a bit.  “Money is nice,” she said, her eyes glittering.  “But the world is full of things that people would never sell.  Favors and obligation are worth far, far more.”\r\n I looked down at the nine talents gleaming on her desk.  “You don’t have a minimum loan amount, do you?”  I asked, already knowing the answer.  “You just told me that so I’d be forced to borrow more.  You were hoping I’d dig myself a hole too deep and not be able to pay you back.”\r\n Devi smiled brightly.  “Welcome to the game,” she said as she began to pick up the coins.  “Thanks for playing.”\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOUR Sword and Shaed\r\n With my purse full to bursting and Alveron’s letter of credit assuring my tuition, my winter term was carefree as a walk in the garden.\r\n It was strange not having to live like a miser.  I had clothes that fit me and could afford to have them laundered.  I could have coffee or chocolate whenever I wanted.  I no longer needed to toil endlessly in the Fishery and could spend time tinkering simply to satisfy my curiosity or pursue projects simply for the joy of it.\r\n After almost a year away, it took me a while to settle back into the University.  It felt odd not wearing a sword after all this time.  But such things were frowned on here, and I knew it would cause more trouble than it was worth.\r\n At first I left Caesura in my rooms.  But I knew better than anyone how easy it would be to break in and steal it.  The drop bar would only keep away a very genteel thief.  A more pragmatic one could simply break my window and be gone in less than a minute.  Since the sword was quite literally irreplaceable, and I’d made promises to keep it safe, it wasn’t long before I moved it to a hiding place in the Underthing.\r\n My shaed was easier to keep at hand, as I was able to change its shape with a little work.  These days it only rarely billowed on its own.  More commonly it refused to move as much as the gusting wind seemed to demand.  You’d think people would notice such things, but they didn’t.  Even Wilem and Simmon, who teased me about my fondness for it, never marked my cloak as anything more than an exceptionally versatile piece of clothing.\r\n In fact, Elodin was the only one to notice anything out of the ordinary about it.  “What’s this?”  he exclaimed when we crossed paths in a small courtyard outside Mains.  “How did you come to be enshaedn?”\r\n “I beg your pardon?”  I asked.\r\n “Your cloak, boy.  Your turning cape.  How in God’s sweet grace did you tumble onto a shaed?”  He mistook my surprise for ignorance.  “Don’t you know what you’re wearing?”\r\n “I know what it is,” I said.  “I’m just surprised that you do.”\r\n He gave me an insulted look.  “I wouldn’t be much of a namer if I couldn’t spot a faerie cloak a dozen feet away.”  He took a corner of it between his fingers.  “Oh, that’s just lovely.  Here’s a piece of old magic man rarely lays a finger on.”\r\n “It’s new magic, actually,” I said.\r\n “What do you mean?”  he asked.\r\n When it became obvious my explanation involved a long story, Elodin led us into a small, cozy pub I’d never seen before.  I hesitate to call it a pub at all, actually.  It wasn’t full of chattering students and the smell of beer.  It was dim and quiet with a low ceiling and scattered clusters of deep, comfortable chairs.  It smelled of leather and old wine.\r\n We sat near a warm radiator and sipped mulled cider while I told him the whole story of my unintentional trip into the Fae.  It was a wonderful relief.  I hadn’t been able to tell anyone yet for fear of being laughed out of the University.\r\n Elodin proved to be a surprisingly attentive audience and was especially interested in the fight Felurian and I had had when she had tried to bend me to her will.  After I’d finished the story, he peppered me with questions.  Could I remember what I’d said to call the wind?  How had it felt?  The strange wakefulness I described, was it more like being drunk, or more like going into shock?\r\n I answered as best I could, and eventually he leaned back in his chair, nodding to himself.  “It’s a good sign when a student goes chasing the wind and catches it,” he said approvingly.  “That’s twice you’ve called it now.  It can only get easier.”\r\n “Three times, actually,” I said.  “I found it again when I was off in Ademre.”\r\n He laughed.  “You chased it to the edge of the map!”  he said, making a broad motion with his splayed left hand.  Stunned, I realized it was Adem hand-talk for amazed respect.  “How did it feel?  Do you think you could find its name again if you had need of it?”\r\n I concentrated, trying to nudge my mind into Spinning Leaf.  It had been a month and a thousand miles since I’d tried, and it was hard to tip my mind into that strange, tumbling emptiness.\r\n Eventually I managed it.  I looked around the small room, hoping to see the name of the wind like a familiar friend.  But there was nothing there except dust motes swirling in a beam of sunlight that slanted through a window.\r\n “Well?”  Elodin asked.  “Could you call it if you needed to?”\r\n I hesitated.  “Maybe.”\r\n Elodin nodded as if he understood.  “But probably not if someone were to ask you to?”\r\n I nodded, more than a little disappointed.\r\n “Don’t be discouraged.  It will give us something to work toward.”  He grinned happily and clapped me on the back.  “But I think there’s more to your story than you realize.  You called more than the wind.  From what you’ve said, I believe you called Felurian’s name itself.”\r\n I thought back.  My memories of my time in the Fae were oddly patchy, none more than my confrontation with Felurian, which had an odd, almost dreamlike quality to it.  When I tried to remember it in detail, it almost seemed as if it had happened to another person.  “I suppose it’s possible.”\r\n “It’s more than possible,” he assured me.  “I doubt a creature as old and powerful as Felurian could be subdued with nothing more than wind.  Not to belittle your accomplishment,” he hurried to add.  “Calling the wind is more than one student in a thousand ever manages.  But calling the name of a living thing, let alone one of the Fae . .  .”  He raised his eyebrows at me.  “That’s a horse of a different color.”\r\n “Why would a person’s name be so much different?”  I asked, then answered my own question.  “The complexity.”\r\n “Exactly,” he said.  My understanding seemed to excite him.  “To name a thing you must understand it entire.  A stone or a piece of wind is difficult enough.  A person . .  .”  He trailed off significantly.\r\n “I couldn’t claim to understand Felurian,” I said.\r\n “Some part of you did,” he insisted.  “Your sleeping mind.  A rare thing indeed.  If you’d known how difficult it was, you never would have stood a chance of doing it.”\r\n\r\n Since poverty no longer forced me to work endless hours in the Fishery, I was free to study more broadly than ever before.

The weather gets warmer and warmer, everything changes and seems to revive.  The trees begin to bud.  Sometimes it rains, but there are no rough winds and the sun shines brightly.  The grass is green and one can see a lot of flowers peeping out from it.  In spring all the migratory birds return.  They sing sweetly on the branches of the trees.\r\n\r\n The summer months are June, July and August.  Summer is the hottest season of the year.  The days are the longest in summer.  The longest day of the year is the 22nd of June.  Some people like summer best of all.  All of us enjoy summer with its cloudless sunshine, and with its gardens and meadows full of flowers.  There are a lot of fruit and vegetables at that time.  In summer, many people leave town and spend the hottest time in the countryside or at the sea.\r\n\r\n After summer, autumn comes.  The autumn months are September, October and November.  The warm days of early autumn are called the \"Indian Summer\", Babye Leto or the \"Golden Autumn\".  The “Golden Autumn” is really beautiful with its trees full of yellow, red, bronze and golden leaves falling through the air, dancing like a ballet!\r\n\r\n Autumn is also the season of fruit and vegetables.  But the days become shorter and the nights grow longer and darker.  The weather is not so good as in spring and  summer.  It often rains and the air gets colder and colder.\r\n\r\n Winter is the coldest season of the year.  The winter months are December, January and February.  The winter days are short and gloomy.  It often snows and freezes to temperatures minus 20 Celsius and below.  Winter is a very beautiful time of year, too.  Some people like it very much.  It is pleasant to walk when it's snowing and not very cold.  For most of the winter, the ground is completely covered with snow.  Trees and rooftops are white with snow too.  Winter also provides great opportunities for those who go in for winter sports.  I think every season has a charm of its own."

The man will always interfere in the kitchen.  The woman will shout and drive him away.  It is generally assumed that cooking is the housewife's job.  Take for example, different advertisements.  You can see a certain picture: a hungry man is sitting and looking expectantly at the table, meanwhile his wife is bustling to and from the stove.  Then she gives her husband a dish which ensures his adoration for ever.\r\n\r\n Does he want to cook after this?  Many people will reply: \"He even shouldn't\".\r\n\r\n The idea that a woman should always cook is completely wrong.

More and more people have come to the realization that electronic devices will never be able to replace the human brain.\r\n\r\n All over the world people are learning foreign languages.  Everybody knows his native language, but foreign languages are very useful.  It is important to know languages when we travel to other countries or when we have to read foreign literature in the original, in addition to communication with foreigners.  Being able to communicate in foreign languages is vital and necessary in the 21st century, when international cooperation is operating at its highest level.  In a word, if you know the language of a foreign country, you can talk to its people and understand them.  Knowing a foreign language can also help you get a better job in life.\r\n\r\n There are more than 2700 languages in the world, not to mention the many dialects and sub-languages spoken on every continent.  There are also 6 official languages of the United Nations, and English and Russian are included on this list.\r\n\r\n English, for example, is spoken not only in the British Isles, North America, and Australia, but also in other non-English speaking parts of the world.  It is considered to be the number one language of international use, and is the official language of global business.\r\n\r\n About 328 million people speak English as their mother tongue, plus at least 375 million people use it as a second language.  (source Wikipedia).  Some estimates state that as many as 900 million people speak English, either as a native speaker or as a second language combined.\r\n\r\n It is next to impossible to count how many people are learning English, the numbers are staggering!\r\n\r\n Moreover, these days, in the 21st century, it is not necessary to go abroad to communicate with native speakers.

        "text":"I continued my usual classes in sympathy, medicine, and artificing, then added chemistry, herbology, and comparative female anatomy.\r\n My curiosity had been pricked by my encounter with the Lockless box, and I attempted to learn something about Yllish story knots.  But I quickly discovered most books on Yll were historical, not linguistic, and gave no information as to how I might actually read a knot.\r\n So I scoured the Dead Ledgers and discovered a single shelf of disused books concerning Yll in one of the unpleasant, low-ceilinged sections of the lower basements.  Then, while looking for a place to sit and read, I discovered a small room tucked behind a piece of jutting shelving.\r\n It wasn’t a reading hole as I suspected.  Inside were hundreds of large wooden spools wound about with knotted string.  They weren’t books, precisely, but they were the Yllish equivalent.  A thin layer of dust covered everything, and I doubted anyone had been in the room for decades.\r\n I have a vast weakness for secret things.  But I quickly found that reading the knots was impossible without first understanding Yllish.  There were no classes on the subject, and asking around revealed none of Master Linguist’s gillers knew more than a scattering of words.\r\n I wasn’t terribly surprised, considering Yll had been nearly ground to dust under the iron boots of the Aturan Empire.  The piece that remained today was populated mostly by sheep.  And if you stood in the middle of the country, you could throw a stone across the border.  Still, it was a disappointing end to my search.\r\n Then, several days later, Master Linguist summoned me to his office.  He’d heard that I’d been making inquiries, and he happened to speak Yllish rather well.  He offered to tutor me personally, and I gladly took him up on his offer.\r\n Since I’d come to the University, I’d only seen Master Linguist during admissions interviews and when I was brought up on the horns for disciplinary reasons.  Acting as Chancellor, he was rather grim and formal.  But when he wasn’t sitting in the Chancellor’s chair, Master Herma was a surprisingly deft and gentle teacher.  He was witty with a surprisingly irreverent sense of humor.  The first time he told me a dirty joke, you could have knocked me over with a feather.\r\n Elodin wasn’t teaching a class this term, but I began to study naming privately under his direction.  It went more smoothly now that I understood there was a method to his madness.\r\n Count Threpe was overjoyed to find me alive and threw a resurrection party where I was proudly displayed to the local nobility.  I had a suit of clothes tailored specifically for the event, and in a fit of nostalgia I chose to have them done in the colors my old troupe had worn: the green and grey of Lord Greyfallow’s men.\r\n After the party, over a bottle of wine in his sitting room, I told Threpe of my adventures.  I left off the story of Felurian, as I knew he wouldn’t believe it.  And I couldn’t tell him half of what I’d done in the Maer’s service.  Consequently, Threpe thought Alveron had been quite generous in rewarding me.  I didn’t argue the point.\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE Stories\r\n Ambrose had been blessedly absent during the winter term, but when spring arrived he came back to roost like some sort of hateful, migratory bird.  By no coincidence, the day after he returned, I skipped all my classes and spent the entire day making myself a new gram.\r\n As soon as the snow melted and the ground grew firm again, I resumed my practice of the Ketan.  Remembering how odd it had looked when I’d first seen it, I did this in the privacy of the forest north of the University.\r\n With spring term came a new round of admissions.  I showed up for my interview with a profound hangover and fumbled a few questions.  My tuition was set at eighteen talents and five, earning me four talents and change from the Bursar.\r\n Sales of the Bloodless had slackened over the winter, as there were fewer merchants visiting the University.  But once snows melted and roads grew dry, the handful that had accumulated in the Stocks sold quickly, bringing me another six talents.\r\n I was unused to having so much money at my disposal, and I’ll admit I went a little mad with it.  I owned six suits of clothes that fit me and had all the paper I could use.  I bought fine, dark ink from Arueh and purchased my own set of engraving tools.  I had two pairs of shoes.  Two.\r\n I found an ancient, ragged Yllish dictum buried in a bookstore in Imre.  Full of drawings of knots, the bookstore owner thought it was a sailor’s journal and I bought it for a mere talent and a half.  Not long after I bought a copy of The Heroborica, then added a copy of Termigus Techina I could use as a reference while designing schema in the privacy of my own room.\r\n I bought dinner for my friends.  Auri had new dresses and bright ribbons for her hair.  All this and still money in my purse.  How odd.  How wonderful.\r\n\r\n Toward the middle of the term I began to hear familiar stories.  Stories about a certain red-haired adventurer who had spent the night with Felurian.  Stories of a dashing young arcanist with all the powers of Taborlin the Great.  It had taken months, but my exploits in Vintas had finally passed their way from mouth to ear all the long miles back to the University.\r\n It may be true that when I finally became aware of these stories I lengthened my shaed a bit and wore it more often than before.  It might also be the case that I spent a shameful amount of time in alehouses over the next several span, lurking quietly, listening to stories.  I might even have gone so far as to offer a suggestion or two.\r\n I was young, after all, and it was only natural for me to delight in my notoriety.  I thought it would fade in time.  Why shouldn’t I revel a bit in the sidelong glances my fellow students made?  Why not enjoy it while it lasted?\r\n Many of the stories centered around me hunting bandits and rescuing young girls.  But none of them came terribly close to the truth.  No story can move a thousand miles by word of mouth and keep its shape.\r\n While the details differed, most of them followed a familiar thread: young women were in need of rescuing.  Sometimes a nobleman hired me.  Sometimes it was a concerned father, a distraught mayor, or a bumbling constable.\r\n Most of the time I saved a pair of girls.  Sometimes only one, sometimes there were three.  They were best friends.  They were mother and daughter.  I heard one story where there were seven of them, all sisters, all beautiful princesses, all virgins.  You know that sort of story.\r\n There was a great deal of variety as to who exactly I was rescuing the girls from.  Bandits were fairly common, but there were also wicked uncles, stepmothers, and shamble-men.  One story, in an odd twist, had me rescuing them from Adem mercenaries.  There was even an ogre or two.\r\n While I did occasionally rescue the girls from a troupe of traveling players, I’m proud to say I never heard a story where they were kidnapped by the Edema Ruh.\r\n The story generally had one of two endings.  In the first I leapt to the battle like Prince Gallant and fought sword on sword until everyone was dead, fled, or appropriately repentant.  The second ending was more popular.  It involved me calling down fire and lightning from the sky after the fashion of Taborlin the Great.\r\n In my favorite version of the story, I met a helpful tinker on the road.  I shared my dinner, and he told me of two children stolen from a nearby farm.  Before I left, he sold me an egg, three iron nails, and a shabby cloak that could render me invisible.  I used the items and my considerable wit to save the children from the clutches of a cunning, hungry trow.\r\n But while there were many versions of that tale, the story of Felurian was more popular by far.  The song I’d written had made the journey west as well.  And since songs hold their shape better than stories, the details about my encounter with Felurian were moderately close to the truth.\r\n When Wil and Sim pressed me for details, I told them the whole story.  It took me a while to convince them I was telling the truth.  Rather, it took me a while to convince Sim.  For some reason, Wil was perfectly willing to accept the existence of the Fae.\r\n I didn’t blame Sim.  Until I saw her, I would have bet solid money Felurian didn’t exist.  It’s one thing to enjoy a story, but it’s quite another to take it for the truth.\r\n\r\n “The real question,” Sim said thoughtfully, “is how old you really are.”\r\n “I know that one,” Wilem said with the somber pride of someone desperately pretending to not be drunk.  “Seventeen.”\r\n “Ahhhh . .  .”  Sim held up a finger dramatically.  “You’d think so, wouldn’t you?”\r\n “What are you talking about?”  I asked.\r\n Sim leaned forward in his chair.  “You went into the Fae, spent some time there, then came out to discover only three days had passed,” Sim said.  “Does that mean you’re only three days older?  Or did you age while you were there?”\r\n I was quiet for a moment.  “I hadn’t thought of that,” I admitted.\r\n “In stories,” Wilem said, “boys go into Fae and return as men.  That implies one grows older.”\r\n “If you’re going to go by stories,” Sim said.\r\n “What else?”  Wil asked.  “Will you consult Marlock’s Compendium of Fae Phenomenon?  Find me such a book, and I will reference it.”\r\n Sim gave an agreeable shrug.\r\n “So,” Wil said, turning to me.  “How long were you there?”\r\n “That’s hard to figure,” I said.  “There wasn’t any day or night.  And my memories are a bit odd.”  I thought for a long moment.  “We talked, swam, ate dozens upon dozens of times, explored a bit.  And, well . .  .”  I paused to clear my throat meaningfully.\r\n “Cavorted,” suggested Wil.\r\n “Thank you.  And cavorted quite a bit as well.”  I counted the skills Felurian had taught me, and then figured she couldn’t have taught me more than two or three a day. . . .\r\n “It was at least a couple months,” I said.  “I shaved once, or was it twice?  Time enough for me to grow a bit of a beard.”\r\n Wil rolled his eyes at this, running his hand over his own dark Cealdish beard.\r\n “Nothing like your marvelous facebear,” I said.  “Still, mine grew out at least two or three times.”\r\n “So at least two months,” Sim said.  “But how long could it have been?”\r\n “Three months?”  How many stories had we shared?  “Four or five months?”  I thought of how slowly we’d had to move my shaed from starlight to moonlight to firelight.  “A year?”  It was in the mottling ache of bruises that bloomed across a body, and it was in the hands of the man who wore the bruises as he rose stiffly from his bed, teeth clenched against the pain.\r\n The man had true-red hair, red as flame.  His eyes were dark and distant, and he moved with the subtle certainty of a thief in the night.  He made his way downstairs.  There, behind the tightly shuttered windows, he lifted his hands like a dancer, shifted his weight, and slowly took one single perfect step.\r\n The Waystone was his, just as the third silence was his.  This was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself.  It was deep and wide as autumn’s ending.  It was heavy as a great river-smooth stone.  It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die."

        "text":"\"I bet you miss it as much as me.\"\r\n \"Harry, you're going into the dead zone.  Call me back when… don't take too long.\"\r\n \"Okay, Kiz, I'll let you know.\"\r\n I was still smiling after closing the phone.  There is nothing like being wanted or being welcomed.  Being valued.\r\n But also the idea of having a badge again in order to do what I had to do.  I thought about Ritz at Metro and how he had treated me.  How I had to fight just to get the attention and help of some people.  I knew a lot of that would go away with the badge again.  In the last two years I had learned that the badge didn't necessarily make the man, but it sure as hell made the man's job easier.  And for me it was more than a job.  I knew that badge or no badge, there was one thing on this earth I could and should be doing.  I had a mission in this life, just as Terry McCaleb had.  Spending the day before in his floating shop of horrors, studying his cases and his dedication to his mission, made me realize what was important and what I had to do.  In his dying my silent partner may have saved me.\r\n After forty minutes of mulling over my future and considering my choices, I came to the sign I had seen in the photo on Terry's computer.  ZZYZX ROAD\r\n I MILE\r\n It was not the exact sign.  I could tell by the horizon behind it.  The photo had been taken from the other side, by someone heading to L.A. from Vegas.  Nevertheless, I felt a deep tug of anticipation.  Everything I had seen or read or heard since Graciela McCaleb had called me led to this place.  I put on the blinker and took the exit off the freeway.\r\n CHAPTER 16\r\n Midmorning on the day after Rachel Walling's arrival the agents assigned to what had been labeled the \" Zzyzx Road case\" gathered in person and by phone in the squad room on the third floor of the John Lawrence Bailey Building in Las Vegas.  The room was windowless and poorly ventilated.  A photograph of Bailey, an agent killed during a bank robbery twenty years earlier, looked upon the proceedings.\r\n The agents in attendance sat at tables lined in rows, facing the front of the room.  At the front was Randal Alpert and a two-way television that was connected by phone and camera to a squad room in Quantico, Virginia.  On the screen was Agent Brasilia Doran, waiting to provide her report.  Rachel was at the second row of tables, sitting off by herself.  She knew her place here and outwardly tried to show it.\r\n Alpert convened the meeting by graciously introducing those present.  Rachel thought that this was a nicety allowed for her but soon realized that not everyone in attendance in person or by audiovisual hookup knew everyone else.\r\n Alpert first identified Doran, also known as Brass, on the line from Quantico, where she was handling the collating of information and acting as liaison to the national lab.  He then asked each person seated in the room to identify themselves and their specialty or position.  First was Cherie Dei, who said she was the case agent.  Next to her was her partner, Tom Zigo.  Next was John Cates, a representative agent from the local FO and the only nonwhite person in attendance.\r\n The next four people were from the science side and Rachel had seen and met two of them at the site the day before.  They included a forensic anthropologist named Greta Coxe, who was in charge of the excavations, two medical examiners named Harvey Richards- and Douglas Sundeen, and a crime scene specialist named Mary Pond.  Ed Gunning, another agent from Behavioral Sciences in Quantico, brought the introductions around to Rachel, who was last.\r\n \"Agent Rachel Walling,\" she said.  \"  Rapid City field office.  Formerly with Behavioral.  I have some… familiarity with a case like this.\"\r\n \"Okay, thanks, Rachel,\" Alpert said quickly, as though he thought Rachel was going to mention Robert Backus by name.\r\n This told Rachel that there were people in the room who had not been informed of the major fact of the case.  She guessed that would be Cates, the token agent from the FO.  She wondered if some of the science team, or all of it, was in the dark as well.\r\n \"Let's start with the science side,\" Alpert continued.  \"First of all, Brass?  Anything from out there?\"\r\n \"Not on science.  I think your crime scene people have all of that.  Hello, Rachel.  Long time.\"\r\n \"Hello, Brass,\" Rachel said quietly.  \"Too long.\"\r\n She looked at the screen and their eyes met.  Rachel realized that it had probably been eight years since she had actually seen Doran.  She looked weary, her mouth and eyes drawn down, her hair short in a cut that suggested she didn't spend much time with it.  She was an empath, Rachel knew, and the years were taking their toll.\r\n \"You look good,\" Doran said.  \"I guess all that fresh air and open country agrees with you.\"\r\n Alpert stepped in and saved Rachel from delivering a false compliment in return.\r\n \"Greta, Harvey, who wants to go first?\"  he asked, stepping all over the electronic reunion.\r\n \"I guess I will since everything starts with the dig,\" Greta Coxe said.  \"As of seven p.m. yesterday we have fully excavated eight bodies and they are at Neilis.  This afternoon when we get back there, we will begin with number nine.  What we saw with the first excavations is holding true with the latter.  The plastic bags in each incidence and the-\"\r\n \"Greta, we have a tape going here,\" Alpert interrupted.  \"Let's be fully descriptive.  As if speaking to an uninformed audience.  Don't hold back.\"\r\n Except when it comes to mentioning Robert Backus, Rachel thought.\r\n \"Okay, sure,\" Coxe said.  \"Um, all eight bodies excavated and exhumed so far have been fully clothed.  Decomposition is extensive.  Hands and feet bound by tape.  All have plastic bags over the head, which in turn have been taped around the neck.  There is no variation on this methodology, even between victims one and two.  Which is unusual.\"\r\n Late the day before Rachel had seen the photos.  She had gone back into the command RV and looked at the wall of photos.  It seemed clear to her that the men had all been suffocated.  The plastic bags had not been clear plastic but even in their opaqueness she could see the features of the faces and the mouths wide open and searching for air that wasn't going to come.  They reminded her of photos of wartime atrocities, disinterred bodies from mass graves in Yugoslavia or Iraq.\r\n \"Why is that unusual?\"  Alpert asked.\r\n \"Because what we most often see is that the killing plan evolves.  For lack of a better way of describing it, the killing gets better.  The unsub learns from victim to victim how to do it better.  That is usually seen in the data we have.\"\r\n Rachel noted that Coxe had used the word unsub.  Short for unknown subject.  It most likely meant she was out of the loop and didn't know that the subject was very much known to the FBI.\r\n \"Okay, so the methodology was set from day one,\" Alpert said.  \"Anything else, Greta?\"\r\n \"Just that we will probably be finished with the excavations the day after tomorrow.  Unless we get another hit with the probes.\"\r\n \"Are we still probing?\"\r\n \"Yes, when we have the time. "

Climate has a very important influence on plants, animals and humans and is different in different parts of the world.  Some scientists think that the world is becomming hotter.  If you compare Moscow winter and summer temperatures at the beginning of our century and at its end you will see that climate has really changed.  Winters have become warmer.  Sometimes there is little snow in January, and there were winters when it rained on the New Year's Eve.  Many people say that it is so because of the greenhouse effect.  During the last 100 years people have produced a lot of carbon dioxide.  This gas in the atmosphere works like glass in a greenhouse.  It lets heat get in, but it doesn't let much heat get out.  So the atmosphere becomes warmer.  Where does the carbon dioxide come from?  People and animals breathe in oxygen, and breathe out carbon dioxide.  We produce carbon dioxide when we burn things.  Trees take this gas from the air, and produce oxygen.  But in the last few years, people have cut down and burn big areas of rainforest.  This means there are fewer trees, and, of course, more carbon dioxide!  As we see the climate in different parts of the world changes a little from year to year.  These changes can be dangerous for our planet, which needs protection.  Earth is millions of years old, much older than the humans.  We know many of its secrets.  Yet there is still much to learn."

        "text":"I thought about the wretched time I’d spent recovering from my encounter with the Cthaeh.  “I’m sure it couldn’t have been more than a year. . .  .”  My voice didn’t sound nearly as convincing as I would have liked.\r\n Wilem raised an eyebrow.  “Well then, happy birthday.”  He lifted his glass to me.  “Or birthdays, depending.”\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-SIX Failures\r\n During spring term I experienced several failures.\r\n The first of these was mostly a failure in my own eyes.  I had expected that picking up Yllish would be relatively easy.  But nothing could have been further from the truth.\r\n In a handful of days I had learned enough Tema to defend myself in court.  But Tema was a very orderly language, and I’d already known a little bit from my studies.  Perhaps most importantly, there was a great deal of overlap between Tema and Aturan.  They used the same characters for writing, and many words are related.\r\n Yllish shared nothing with Aturan or Shaldish, or even with Ademic for that matter.  It was an irrational, tangled mess.  Fourteen indicative verb tenses.  Bizarre formal inflections of address.\r\n You couldn’t merely say “the Chancellor’s socks.”  Oh no.  Too simple.  All ownership was oddly dual: as if the Chancellor owned his socks, but at the same time the socks somehow also gained ownership of the Chancellor.  This altered the use of both words in complex grammatical ways.  As if the simple act of owning socks somehow fundamentally changed the nature of a person.\r\n So even after months of study with the Chancellor, Yllish grammar was still a muddy jumble to me.  All I had to show for my work was a messy smattering of vocabulary.  My understanding of the story knots was even worse.  I tried to improve matters by practicing with Deoch.  But he wasn’t much of a teacher and admitted the only person he’d ever known who could read story knots had been his grandmother who had died when he was very young.\r\n Second came my failure in advanced chemistry, taken under Mandrag’s giller, Anisat.  While the material fascinated me, I did not get along with Anisat himself.\r\n I loved the discovery chemistry offered.  I loved the thrill of experiment, the challenge of trial and retrial.  I loved the puzzle of it.  I also will admit a somewhat foolish fondness toward the apparatus involved.  The bottles and tubes.  The acids and salts.  The mercury and flame.  There is something primal in chemistry, something that defies explication.  Either you feel it or you don’t.\r\n Anisat didn’t feel it.  For him chemistry was written journals and carefully penned rows of numbers.  He would make me perform the same titration four times simply because my notation was incorrect.  Why write a number down?  Why should I take ten minutes to write what my hands could finish in five?\r\n So we argued.  Gently at first, but neither of us were willing to back down.  As a result, barely two span into the term we ended up shouting at each other in the middle of the Crucible while thirty students looked on, openmouthed with dismay.\r\n He told me to leave his class, calling me an irreverent dennerling with no respect for authority.  I called him a pompous slipstick who had missed his true calling as a counting-house scribe.  In all fairness, we both had some valid points.\r\n My other failure came in mathematics.  After listening to Fela chatter excitedly for months about what she was learning under Master Brandeur, I set out to further my number lore.\r\n Unfortunately the loftier peaks of mathematics did not delight me.

        "text":"Nothing is ever lost: belief systems are built on previous ones, but the earliest were not religions in our sense of the term\r\n\r\n One of Robert Bellah's central ideas is that \"nothing is ever lost\".  We are built like the cities of Troy on our previous selves.  Every night we sleep uneasily on their rubble.  Religious and ethical systems are also built on their predecessors, and this is true both socially and psychologically.  Even the most abstract theologian will refresh her mind in ritual and, if she doesn't, will soon cease to believe.\r\n\r\n This isn't because ritual dulls the mind and kill doubts, but because belief is an emotional fact, quite as much as disbelief can be.  To hold that something is true and not to care in the least that it is so is not to believe it in any religious or important sense.\r\n\r\n With this in mind, it's clear that, to look for the roots of religion, we have to look at the roots of language.  This is another link to ritual, for Bellah believes that language and music come from the same roots.  He talks about \"musilanguage\" as an early form of communication, in which the tones, the tunes and the rhythms convey a great part of the meaning.  Musilanguage is still present in our lives today, of course.  We can see it in everything that is lost when conversation is reduced to an exchange of plain text.\r\n\r\n Both, he believes, arose first in play.  Mammalian play is very important to him, for it is the first place in evolution where animals are free from deficiency consciousness.  It is gratuitous behaviour.  Play is undertaken for its own sake.  It can be extremely serious: the opposite of \"play\" is not \"serious\", or even \"real\", but \"work\", which is something undertaken for ends outside itself.  But play operates in its own time, and within its own rules, neither of which need have anything to do with the world outside.\r\n\r\n It's worth noting in passing here that, although this is an \"evolutionary\" account of psychology, it is nothing like what's known as \"evolutionary psychology\".  Bellah does not postulate a \"play module\", or explain that children who are good at games grow up to have more descendants than the nerds.\r\n\r\n One other thing about play, which makes it important in the earliest forms of religion, and of language, is that it is essentially embodied.  It starts with actions, and only later, if at all, moves on to ideas.  It never entirely loses the connection to action.  This is one way into the importance of ritual.  There are certain things we know only because our bodies have done them, and some kinds of knowledge are inexplicable in words.  Bellah is too high-minded to mention sex in this context, but anyone who was an unhappy teenage virgin can remember what such an absence of knowledge felt like.  He talks instead about bicycle-riding, a less exciting example of a skill we can learn but never express in words.\r\n\r\n Religious practice is full of gestures, of course: hands are clasped in prayer, or the whole body kneels, or lies flat in token of submission.  These things are also performed for an audience.  Solitary prayer is a very late and highly developed form of ritual.  It starts as something communal.  Music, dancing and storytelling are all embodied reactions to the world and, when you join in, they become a kind of explanation, too.\r\n\r\n Nothing is ever lost.  A theory is not a better version of a story, nor even a story cleansed of worthless decoration.  I know there are people who believe it is.  The progress from myth to theory is one of the central rationalist stories.  But this is itself a myth more than a factual, historical account.  It gains its power and coherence from a belief in progress.  If that fails, there is nothing but confusion left.\r\n\r\n So what are the earliest religions we can find?  The first thing they were not is \"religions\".  They didn't have theologies.  They didn't have priesthoods or scriptures.  They didn't have explicit theories of how the world is.  They may not even have had creation myths, in the sense that, without an order of time, creation might have happened yesterday.  Living after Christianity as we do, we assume that creation myths have to explain why the world is not perfect.  This may not have seemed to our ancestors a question worth asking.\r\n\r\n What they did have was fierce egalitarianism.  The first questions that ritual answered were not concerned with where we come from, but how to live as a community, which survives by sharing and co-operation.  Literate religions have often been used to justify inequality.  But the earliest religions of which we know, or which we can reconstruct, made all their participants equal in rituals.  There was no one in them like a bishop, nor anyone like a king.  The long and twisting road from there to the first dawn of universalist ethics is one that Bellah is trying to map.  It passes through kings, and priest-kings who were even worse than bishops."

        "text":"They say, the chroniclers who have written the history of that low-lying, wind-swept coast, that years ago the foam fringe of the ocean lay further to the east;  so that where now the North Sea creeps among the treacherous sand-reefs, it was once dry land.  In those days, between the Abbey and the sea, there stood a town of seven towers and four rich churches, surrounded by a wall of twelve stones' thickness, making it, as men reckoned then, a place of strength and much import;  and the monks, glancing their eyes downward from the Abbey garden on the hill, saw beneath their feet its narrow streets, gay with the ever passing of rich merchandise, saw its many wharves and water-ways, ever noisy with the babel of strange tongues, saw its many painted masts, wagging their grave heads above the dormer roofs and quaintly-carved oak gables.\r\n\r\n Thus the town prospered till there came a night when it did evil in the sight of God and man.  Those were troublous times to Saxon dwellers by the sea, for the Danish water-rats swarmed round each river mouth, scenting treasure from afar;  and by none was the white flash of their sharp, strong teeth more often seen than by the men of Eastern Anglia, and by none in Eastern Anglia more often than by the watchers on the walls of the town of seven towers that once stood upon the dry land, but which now lies twenty fathom deep below the waters.  Many a bloody fight raged now without and now within its wall of twelve stones' thickness.  Many a groan of dying man, many a shriek of murdered woman, many a wail of mangled child, knocked at the Abbey door upon its way to Heaven, calling the trembling-monks from their beds, to pray for the souls that were passing by.\r\n\r\n But at length peace came to the long-troubled land: Dane and Saxon agreeing to dwell in friendship side by side, East Anglia being wide, and there being room for both.  And all men rejoiced greatly, for all were weary of a strife in which little had been gained on either side beyond hard blows, and their thoughts were of the ingle-nook.  So the long-bearded Danes, their thirsty axes harmless on their backs, passed to and fro in straggling bands, seeking where undisturbed and undisturbing they might build their homes;  and thus it came about that Haafager and his company, as the sun was going down, drew near to the town of seven towers, that in those days stood on dry land between the Abbey and the sea.\r\n\r\n And the men of the town, seeing the Danes, opened wide their gates saying: — \r\n\r\n \"We have fought, but now there is peace.  Enter, and make merry with us, and to-morrow go your way.\"\r\n\r\n But Haafager made answer: — \r\n\r\n \"I am an old man, I pray you do not take my words amiss.  There is peace between us, as you say, and we thank you for your courtesy, but the stains are still fresh upon our swords.  Let us camp here without your walls, and a little later, when the grass has grown upon the fields where we have striven, and our young men have had time to forget, we will make merry together, as men should who dwell side by side in the same land.\"\r\n\r\n But the men of the town still urged Haafager, calling his people neighbours;  and the Abbot, who had hastened down, fearing there might be strife, added his words to theirs, saying: — \r\n\r\n \"Pass in, my children.  Let there indeed be peace between you, that the blessing of God may be upon the land, and upon both Dane and Saxon\";  for the Abbot saw that the townsmen were well disposed towards the Danes, and knew that men, when they have feasted and drunk together, think kinder of one another.\r\n\r\n Then answered Haafager, who knew the Abbot for a holy man: — \r\n\r\n \"Hold up your staff, my father, that the shadow of the cross your people worship may fall upon our path, so we will pass into the town and there shall be peace between us, for though your gods are not our gods, faith between man and man is of all altars.\"\r\n\r\n And the Abbot held his staff aloft between Haafager's people and the sun, it being fashioned in the form of a cross, and under its shadow the Danes passed by into the town of seven towers, there being of them, with the women and the children, nearly two thousand souls, and the gates were made fast behind them.\r\n\r\n So they who had fought face to face, feasted side by side, pledging one another in the wine cup, as was the custom;  and Haafager's men, knowing themselves amongst friends, cast aside their arms, and when the feast was done, being weary, they lay down to sleep.\r\n\r\n Then an evil voice arose in the town, and said: \"Who are these that have come among us to share our land?  Are not the stones of our streets red with the blood of wife and child that they have slain?  Do men let the wolf go free when they have trapped him with meat?  Let us fall upon them now that they are heavy with food and wine, so that not one of them shall escape.  Thus no further harm shall come to us from them nor from their children.\"\r\n\r\n And the voice of evil prevailed, and the men of the town of seven towers fell upon the Danes with whom they had broken meat, even to the women and the little children;  and the blood of the people of Haafager cried with a loud voice at the Abbey door, through the long night it cried, saying: — \r\n\r\n \"I trusted in your spoken word.  I broke meat with you.  I put my faith in you and in your God.  I passed beneath the shadow of your cross to enter your doors.  Let your God make answer!\"\r\n\r\n Nor was there silence till the dawn.\r\n\r\n Then the Abbot rose from where he knelt and called to God, saying: — \r\n\r\n \"Thou hast heard, O God.  Make answer.\"\r\n\r\n And there came a great sound from the sea as though a tongue had been given to the deep, so that the monks fell upon their knees in fear;  but the Abbot answered: — \r\n\r\n \"It is the voice of God speaking through the waters.  He hath made answer.\"\r\n\r\n And that winter a mighty storm arose, the like of which no man had known before;  for the sea was piled upon the dry land until the highest tower of the town of seven towers was not more high;  and the waters moved forward over the dry land.  And the men of the town of seven towers fled from the oncoming of the waters, but the waters overtook them so that not one of them escaped.  And the town of the seven towers and of the four churches, and of the many streets and quays, was buried underneath the waters, and the feet of the waters still moved till they came to the hill whereon the Abbey stood.  Then the Abbot prayed to God that the waters might be stayed, and God heard, and the sea came no farther.\r\n\r\n And that this tale is true, and not a fable made by the weavers of words, he who doubts may know from the fisher-folk, who to-day ply their calling amongst the reefs and sandbanks of that lonely coast.  For there are those among them who, peering from the bows of their small craft, have seen far down beneath their keels a city of strange streets and many quays.  But as to this, I, who repeat these things to you, cannot speak of my own knowledge, for this city of the sea is only visible when a rare wind, blowing from the north, sweeps the shadows from the waves;  and though on many a sunny day I have drifted where its seven towers should once have stood, yet for me that wind has never blown, pushing back the curtains of the sea, and, therefore, I have strained my eyes in vain.\r\n\r\n But this I do know, that the rumbling stones of that ancient Abbey, between which and the foam fringe of the ocean the town of seven towers once lay, now stand upon a wave-washed cliff, and that he who looks forth from its shattered mullions to-day sees only the marshland and the wrinkled waters, hears only the plaint of the circling gulls and the weary crying of the sea.\r\n\r\n And that God's anger is not everlasting, and that the evil that there is in men shall be blotted out, he who doubts may also learn from the wisdom of the simple fisher-folk, who dwell about the borders of the marsh-land;  for they will tell him that on stormy nights there speaks a deep voice from the sea, calling the dead monks to rise from their forgotten graves, and chant a mass for the souls of the men of the town of seven towers.  Clothed in long glittering white, they move with slowly pacing feet around the Abbey's grass-grown aisles, and the music of their prayers is heard above the screaming of the storm.  And to this I also can bear witness, for I have seen the passing of their shrouded forms behind the blackness of the shattered shafts;  I have heard their sweet, sad singing above the wailing of the wind.\r\n\r\n Thus for many ages have the dead monks prayed that the men of the town of seven towers may be forgiven.  Thus, for many ages yet shall they so pray, till the day come when of their once fair Abbey not a single stone shall stand upon its fellow;  and in that day it shall be known that the anger of God against the men of the town of seven towers has passed away;  and in that day the feet of the waters shall move back, and the town of seven towers shall stand again upon the dry land.\r\n\r\n There be some, I know, who say that this is but a legend;  who will tell you that the shadowy shapes that you may see with your own eyes on stormy nights, waving their gleaming arms behind the ruined buttresses are but of phosphorescent foam, tossed by the raging waves above the cliffs;  and that the sweet, sad harmony cleaving the trouble of the night is but the aeolian music of the wind.\r\n\r\n But such are of the blind, who see only with their eyes.  For myself I see the white-robed monks, and hear the chanting of their mass for the souls of the sinful men of the town of seven towers.  For it has been said that when an evil deed is done, a prayer is born to follow it through time into eternity, and plead for it.  Thus is the whole world clasped around with folded hands both of the dead and of the living, as with a shield, lest the shafts of God's anger should consume it.\r\n\r\n Therefore, I know that the good monks of this nameless Abbey are still praying that the sin of those they love may be forgiven.\r\n\r\n God grant good men may say a mass for us."

        "text":"There were three of us in the smoke-room of the _Alexandra_—a very good friend of mine, myself, and, in the opposite corner, a shy-looking, unobtrusive man, the editor, as we subsequently learned, of a New York Sunday paper.\r\n\r\n My friend and I were discussing habits, good and bad.\r\n\r\n \"After the first few months,\" said my friend, \"it is no more effort for a man to be a saint than to be a sinner;  it becomes a mere matter of habit.\"\r\n\r\n \"I know,\" I interrupted, \"it is every whit as easy to spring out of bed the instant you are called as to say 'All Right,' and turn over for just another five minutes' snooze, when you have got into the way of it.  It is no more trouble not to swear than to swear, if you make a custom of it.  Toast and water is as delicious as champagne, when you have acquired the taste for it.  Things are also just as easy the other way about.  It is a mere question of making your choice and sticking to it.\"\r\n\r\n He agreed with me.\r\n\r\n \"Now take these cigars of mine,\" he said, pushing his open case towards me.\r\n\r\n \"Thank you,\" I replied hurriedly, \"I'm not smoking this passage.\"\r\n\r\n \"Don't be alarmed,\" he answered, \"I meant merely as an argument.  Now one of these would make you wretched for a week.\"\r\n\r\n I admitted his premise.\r\n\r\n \"Very well,\" he continued.  \"Now I, as you know, smoke them all day long, and enjoy them.  Why?  Because I have got into the habit.  Years ago, when I was a young man, I smoked expensive Havanas.  I found that I was ruining myself.  It was absolutely necessary that I should take a cheaper weed.  I was living in Belgium at the time, and a friend showed me these.  I don't know what they are—probably cabbage leaves soaked in guano;  they tasted to me like that at first—but they were cheap.  Buying them by the five hundred, they cost me three a penny.  I determined to like them, and started with one a day.  It was terrible work, I admit, but as I said to myself, nothing could be worse than the Havanas themselves had been in the beginning.  Smoking is an acquired taste, and it must be as easy to learn to like one flavour as another.  I persevered and I conquered.  Before the year was over I could think of them without loathing, at the end of two I could smoke them without positive discomfort.  Now I prefer them to any other brand on the market.  Indeed, a good cigar disagrees with me.\"\r\n\r\n I suggested it might have been less painful to have given up smoking altogether.\r\n\r\n \"I did think of it,\" he replied, \"but a man who doesn't smoke always seems to me bad company.  There is something very sociable about smoke.\"\r\n\r\n He leant back and puffed great clouds into the air, filling the small den with an odour suggestive of bilge water and cemeteries.\r\n\r\n \"Then again,\" he resumed after a pause, \"take my claret.  No, you don't like it.\"  (I had not spoken, but my face had evidently betrayed me.)  \"Nobody does, at least no one I have ever met.  Three years ago, when I was living in Hammersmith, we caught two burglars with it.  They broke open the sideboard, and swallowed five bottlefuls between them.  A policeman found them afterwards, sitting on a doorstep a hundred yards off, the 'swag' beside them in a carpet bag.  They were too ill to offer any resistance, and went to the station like lambs, he promising to send the doctor to them the moment they were safe in the cells.  Ever since then I have left out a decanterful upon the table every night.\r\n\r\n \"Well, I like that claret, and it does me good.  I come in sometimes dead beat.  I drink a couple of glasses, and I'm a new man.  I took to it in the first instance for the same reason that I took to the cigars—it was cheap.  I have it sent over direct from Geneva, and it costs me six shillings a dozen.  How they do it I don't know.  I don't want to know.  As you may remember, it's fairly heady and there's body in it.\r\n\r\n \"I knew one man,\" he continued, \"who had a regular Mrs. Caudle of a wife.  All day long she talked to him, or at him, or of him, and at night he fell asleep to the rising and falling rhythm of what she thought about him.  At last she died, and his friends congratulated him, telling him that now he would enjoy peace.  But it was the peace of the desert, and the man did not enjoy it.  For two-and-twenty years her voice had filled the house, penetrated through the conservatory, and floated in faint shrilly waves of sound round the garden, and out into the road beyond.  The silence now pervading everywhere frightened and disturbed him.  The place was no longer home to him.  He missed the breezy morning insult, the long winter evening's reproaches beside the flickering fire.  At night he could not sleep.  For hours he would lie tossing restlessly, his ears aching for the accustomed soothing flow of invective.\r\n\r\n \"'Ah!'  he would cry bitterly to himself, 'it is the old story, we never know the value of a thing until we have lost it.'\r\n\r\n \"He grew ill.  The doctors dosed him with sleeping draughts in vain.  At last they told him bluntly that his life depended upon his finding another wife, able and willing to nag him to sleep.\r\n\r\n \"There were plenty of wives of the type he wanted in the neighbourhood, but the unmarried women were, of necessity, inexperienced, and his health was such that he could not afford the time to train them.\r\n\r\n \"Fortunately, just as despair was about to take possession of him, a man died in the next parish, literally talked to death, the gossip said, by his wife.  He obtained an introduction, and called upon her the day after the funeral.  She was a cantankerous old woman, and the wooing was a harassing affair, but his heart was in his work, and before six months were gone he had won her for his own.\r\n\r\n \"She proved, however, but a poor substitute.  The spirit was willing but the flesh was weak.  She had neither that command of language nor of wind that had distinguished her rival.  From his favourite seat at the bottom of the garden he could not hear her at all, so he had his chair brought up into the conservatory.  It was all right for him there so long as she continued to abuse him;  but every now and again, just as he was getting comfortably settled down with his pipe and his newspaper, she would suddenly stop.\r\n\r\n \"He would drop his paper and sit listening, with a troubled, anxious expression.\r\n\r\n \"'Are you there, dear?'  he would call out after a while.\r\n\r\n \"'Yes, I'm here.  Where do you think I am you old fool?'  she would gasp back in an exhausted voice.\r\n\r\n \"His face would brighten at the sound of her words.  'Go on, dear,' he would answer.  'I'm listening.  I like to hear you talk.'\r\n\r\n \"But the poor woman was utterly pumped out, and had not so much as a snort left.\r\n\r\n \"Then he would shake his head sadly.  'No, she hasn't poor dear Susan's flow,' he would say.  'Ah!  what a woman that was!'\r\n\r\n \"At night she would do her best, but it was a lame and halting performance by comparison.  After rating him for little over three-quarters of an hour, she would sink back on the pillow, and want to go to sleep.  But he would shake her gently by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n \"'Yes, dear,' he would say, 'you were speaking about Jane, and the way I kept looking at her during lunch.'\r\n\r\n \"It's extraordinary,\" concluded my friend, lighting a fresh cigar, \"what creatures of habit we are.\"\r\n\r\n \"Very,\" I replied.  \"I knew a man who told tall stories till when he told a true one nobody believed it.\"\r\n\r\n \"Ah, that was a very sad case,\" said my friend.\r\n\r\n \"Speaking of habit,\" said the unobtrusive man in the corner, \"I can tell you a true story that I'll bet my bottom dollar you won't believe.\"\r\n\r\n \"Haven't got a bottom dollar, but I'll bet you half a sovereign I do,\" replied my friend, who was of a sporting turn.  \"Who shall be judge?\"\r\n\r\n \"I'll take your word for it,\" said the unobtrusive man, and started straight away.\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n \"He was a Jefferson man, this man I'm going to tell you of,\" he begun.  \"He was born in the town, and for forty-seven years he never slept a night outside it.  He was a most respectable man—a drysalter from nine to four, and a Presbyterian in his leisure moments.  He said that a good life merely meant good habits.  He rose at seven, had family prayer at seven-thirty, breakfasted at eight, got to his business at nine, had his horse brought round to the office at four, and rode for an hour, reached home at five, had a bath and a cup of tea, played with and read to the children (he was a domesticated man) till half-past six, dressed and dined at seven, went round to the club and played whist till quarter after ten, home again to evening prayer at ten-thirty, and bed at eleven.  For five-and-twenty years he lived that life with never a variation.  It worked into his system and became mechanical.  The church clocks were set by him.  He was used by the local astronomers to check the sun.\r\n\r\n \"One day a distant connection of his in London, an East Indian Merchant and an ex-Lord Mayor died, leaving him sole legatee and executor.  The business was a complicated one and needed management.  He determined to leave his son by his first wife, now a young man of twenty-four, in charge at Jefferson, and to establish himself with his second family in England, and look after the East Indian business.\r\n\r\n \"He set out from Jefferson City on October the fourth, and arrived in London on the seventeenth.  He had been ill during the whole of the voyage, and he reached the furnished house he had hired in Bayswater somewhat of a wreck.  A couple of days in bed, however, pulled him round, and on the Wednesday evening he announced his intention of going into the City the next day to see to his affairs.\r\n\r\n \"On the Thursday morning he awoke at one o'clock.  His wife told him she had not disturbed him, thinking the sleep would do him good.  He admitted that perhaps it had.  Anyhow, he felt very well, and he got up and dressed himself.  He said he did not like the idea of beginning his first day by neglecting a religious duty, and his wife agreeing with him, they assembled the servants and the children in the dining-room, and had family prayer at half-past one.  After which he breakfasted and set off, reaching the City about three.\r\n\r\n \"His reputation for punctuality had preceded him, and surprise was everywhere expressed at his late arrival.  He explained the circumstances, however, and made his appointments for the following day to commence from nine-thirty.\r\n\r\n \"He remained at the office until late, and then went home.  For dinner, usually the chief meal of the day, he could manage to eat only a biscuit and some fruit.  He attributed his loss of appetite to want of his customary ride.  He was strangely unsettled all the evening.  He said he supposed he missed his game of whist, and determined to look about him without loss of time for some quiet, respectable club.  At eleven he retired with his wife to bed, but could not sleep.  He tossed and turned, and turned and tossed, but grew only more and more wakeful and energetic.  A little after midnight an overpowering desire seized him to go and wish the children good-night.  He slipped on a dressing-gown and stole into the nursery.  He did not intend it, but the opening of the door awoke them, and he was glad.  He wrapped them up in the quilt, and, sitting on the edge of the bed, told them moral stories till one o'clock.\r\n\r\n \"Then he kissed them, bidding them be good and go to sleep;  and finding himself painfully hungry, crept downstairs, where in the back kitchen he made a hearty meal off cold game pie and cucumber.\r\n\r\n \"He retired to bed feeling more peaceful, yet still could not sleep, so lay thinking about his business affairs till five, when he dropped off.\r\n\r\n \"At one o'clock to the minute he awoke.  His wife told him she had made every endeavour to rouse him, but in vain.  The man was vexed and irritated.  If he had not been a very good man indeed, I believe he would have sworn.  The same programme was repeated as on the Thursday, and again he reached the City at three.\r\n\r\n \"This state of things went on for a month.  The man fought against himself, but was unable to alter himself.  Every morning, or rather every afternoon at one he awoke.  Every night at one he crept down into the kitchen and foraged for food.  Every morning at five he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n \"He could not understand it, nobody could understand it.  The doctor treated him for water on the brain, hypnotic irresponsibility and hereditary lunacy.  Meanwhile his business suffered, and his health grew worse.  He seemed to be living upside down.  His days seemed to have neither beginning nor end, but to be all middle.  There was no time for exercise or recreation.  When he began to feel cheerful and sociable everybody else was asleep.\r\n\r\n \"One day by chance the explanation came.  His eldest daughter was preparing her home studies after dinner.\r\n\r\n \"'What time is it now in New York?'  she asked, looking up from her geography book.\r\n\r\n \"'New York,' said her father, glancing at his watch, 'let me see.  It's just ten now, and there's a little over four and a half hours' difference.  Oh, about half-past five in the afternoon.'\r\n\r\n \"'Then in Jefferson,' said the mother, 'it would be still earlier, wouldn't it?'\r\n\r\n \"'Yes,' replied the girl, examining the map, 'Jefferson is nearly two degrees further west.'\r\n\r\n \"'Two degrees,' mused the father, 'and there's forty minutes to a degree.  That would make it now, at the present moment in Jefferson—'\r\n\r\n \"He leaped to his feet with a cry:\r\n\r\n\"'I've got it!'  he shouted, 'I see it.'\r\n\r\n \"'See what?'  asked his wife, alarmed.\r\n\r\n \"'Why, it's four o'clock in Jefferson, and just time for my ride.  That's what I'm wanting.'\r\n\r\n \"There could be no doubt about it.  For five-and-twenty years he had lived by clockwork.  But it was by Jefferson clockwork, not London clockwork.  He had changed his longitude, but not himself.  The habits of a quarter of a century were not to be shifted at the bidding of the sun.\r\n\r\n \"He examined the problem in all its bearings, and decided that the only solution was for him to return to the order of his old life.  He saw the difficulties in his way, but they were less than those he was at present encountering.  He was too formed by habit to adapt himself to circumstances.  Circumstances must adapt themselves to him.\r\n\r\n \"He fixed his office hours from three till ten, leaving himself at half- past nine.  At ten he mounted his horse and went for a canter in the Row, and on very dark nights he carried a lantern.  News of it got abroad, and crowds would assemble to see him ride past.\r\n\r\n \"He dined at one o'clock in the morning, and afterwards strolled down to his club.  He had tried to discover a quiet, respectable club where the members were willing to play whist till four in the morning, but failing, had been compelled to join a small Soho gambling-hell, where they taught him poker.  The place was occasionally raided by the police, but thanks to his respectable appearance, he generally managed to escape.\r\n\r\n \"At half-past four he returned home, and woke up the family for evening prayers.  At five he went to bed and slept like a top.\r\n\r\n \"The City chaffed him, and Bayswater shook its head over him, but that he did not mind.  The only thing that really troubled him was loss of spiritual communion.  At five o'clock on Sunday afternoons he felt he wanted chapel, but had to do without it.  At seven he ate his simple mid- day meal.  At eleven he had tea and muffins, and at midnight he began to crave again for hymns and sermons.  At three he had a bread-and-cheese supper, and retired early at four a.m., feeling sad and unsatisfied.\r\n\r\n \"He was essentially a man of habit.\"\r\n\r\n * * * * *\r\n\r\n The unobtrusive stranger ceased, and we sat gazing in silence at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n At length my friend rose, and taking half-a-sovereign from his pocket, laid it upon the table, and linking his arm in mine went out with me upon the deck."

        "text":"Twitter is an online social networking service and microblogging service that enables its users to send and read text-based posts of up to 140 characters, known as \"tweets\".  It was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey and launched that July.  The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with over 500 million active users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 billion search queries per day.  Since its launch, the Twitter website has become one of the top 10 most visited on the Internet, and has been described as \"the SMS of the Internet.\"  Unregistered users can read tweets, while registered users can post tweets through the website interface, SMS, or a range of apps for mobile devices.\r\n Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco, with additional servers and offices in New York City, Boston, and San Antonio\r\n Twitter has been cited as an important factor in the Arab Spring and other political protests.\r\n Twitter's origins lie in a \"daylong brainstorming session\" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo.  Dorsey introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. [13] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[14] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes.  The developers initially considered \"10958\" as a short code, but later changed it to \"40404\" for \"ease of use and memorability.\" [15] Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST): \"just setting up my twttr\". [1]\r\n \"...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect.  The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'.  And that's exactly what the product was.\"  – Jack Dorsey[16]\r\n The first Twitter prototype was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006. [7] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo and all of its assets – including Odeo.com and Twitter.com  – from the investors and shareholders. [17] Williams fired Glass who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011. [18] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007. [19]\r\n The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference.  During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. [20] \"The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,\" remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy.  \"Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters.  Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.\" [21]\r\n Reaction at the conference was highly positive.  Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter \"absolutely rul[ed]\" SXSWi.  Social software researcher danah boyd said Twitter \"own[ed]\" the conference. [22] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark \"we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less.  And we just did!\" [23]\r\n The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22, 2010. [24] By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts.  NASA has also hosted over 25 \"tweetups\", events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.\r\n In August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain as President of Revenue from News Corp.'s Fox Audience Network. [25]\r\n On September 14, 2010, Twitter launched a redesigned site[26] including a new logo. [citation needed]\r\n Growth\r\n The company experienced rapid growth.  It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007.  This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008.  In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day. [27] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications. [28] As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter. [29] As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily. [30] As noted on Compete.com,  Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second. [31]\r\n\r\n\r\n Jack Dorsey, a co-founder and the chairman of Twitter, in 2009\r\n Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events.  For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14, 2010.  The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17, 2010,[32] and then again at the close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second. [33] The current record was set during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published. [34] When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words \"Michael Jackson\" at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour. [35]\r\n Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010.  Atebits had developed the Apple Design Award-winning Twitter client Tweetie for the Mac and iPhone.  The application, now called \"Twitter\" and distributed free of charge, is the official Twitter client for the iPhone, iPad and Mac. [36]\r\n From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out \"New Twitter\", an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com.  Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr, and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com.  As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the \"New Twitter experience\" had been rolled out to all users.\r\n On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the \"Old Twitter.\" [37] However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous \"retro\" homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved;  the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20. [38][39]\r\n On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the \"Fly\" design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising.  In addition to the Home tab, the Connect and Discover tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets.  The site's layout has been compared to that of Facebook. [40][41]\r\n On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership.  Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter’s real time news feeds.  Twitter’s director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go. [42]\r\n On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it has 140 million users and sees 340 million tweets per day.  The number of users is up 40% from their September 2011 number, which was said to have been at 100 million at the time. [43]\r\n In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Detroit, with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies. [44] Twitter also expanded its office in Dublin. [45]\r\n On June 4, 2012, Twitter announced the purchase of Washington, D.C. based web design agency Nclud.  Upon the purchase, Nclud's co-founder and director of brand experience, Martin Ringlein, was named Twitter's new design manager. [46] On June 5, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly-redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter. [47]\r\n Leadership\r\n\r\n As chief executive officer, Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company. [48]\r\n On October 16, 2008,[49] Williams took over the role of CEO, and Dorsey became chairman of the board. [50]\r\n On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO.  Dick Costolo, formerly Twitter's chief operating officer, became CEO.  According to a Twitter blog, dated October 4, 2010, Williams was to stay[dated info] with the company and \"be completely focused on product strategy.\" [dated info][51]\r\n According to The New York Times, \"Mr.  Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship\" when Williams was away. [52] According to PC Magazine, Williams was \"no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company\".  He is focused on developing a new startup, but he became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to \"help in any way I can\".  Stone is still with Twitter but is working with AOL as an \"advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy\". [53]\r\n Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development.  His time is split with Square (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco. [52]\r\n In September 2011, board members and investors Fred Wilson and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's Board of Directors. [54]\r\n Logo\r\n\r\n Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo.  The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010.  A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign.\r\n On February 27, 2012, a tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed the evolution of the \"Larry the Bird\" logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA's Boston Celtics fame.  This detail had previously been confirmed when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011. [55]\r\n On June 5, 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the \"Twitter Bird.\"  As of this logo revision, the word \"Twitter\" and the lowercase letter \"t\" are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding.\r\n\r\n Tweets are publicly visible by default;  however, senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers.  Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for smartphones), or by Short Message Service (SMS) available in certain countries. [57] While the service is free, accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees. [citation needed]\r\n Users may subscribe to other users' tweets – this is known as following and subscribers are known as followers[58] or tweeps (Twitter + peeps). [59] The users can also check the people who are un-subscribing them on Twitter better known as unfollowing via various services. [60]\r\n Twitter allows users the ability to update their profile by using their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets. [61]\r\n Twitter has been compared to a web-based Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client. [62] In a 2009 Time essay, technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as \"remarkably simple\":[63]\r\n As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers.  When you choose to follow another Twitter user, that user's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page.  If you follow 20 people, you'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page: breakfast-cereal updates, interesting new links, music recommendations, even musings on the future of education.\r\n Messages\r\n Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a \"#\" sign.  Similarly, the \"@\" sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users. [66] To repost a message from another Twitter user, and share it with one's own followers, the retweet function is symbolized by \"RT\" in the message. [citation needed]\r\n In late 2009, the \"Twitter Lists\" feature was added, making it possible for users to follow (as well as mention and reply to) ad-hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors. [58][67]\r\n Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for international use.  There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2[68] and Orange[69] networks.  In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel,[70] an alternative platform called smsTweet[71] was set up by a user to work on all networks. [72] A similar platform called GladlyCast[73] exists for mobile phone users in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. [citation needed]\r\n The messages were initially set to a 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages.  The 140-character limit has also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly, goo.gl, and tr.im, and content-hosting services, such as Twitpic, memozu.com  and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters.  Twitter uses its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website. [74]"

        "text":"He got in at Ipswich with seven different weekly papers under his arm.  I noticed that each one insured its reader against death or injury by railway accident.  He arranged his luggage upon the rack above him, took off his hat and laid it on the seat beside him, mopped his bald head with a red silk handkerchief, and then set to work steadily to write his name and address upon each of the seven papers.  I sat opposite to him and read _Punch_.  I always take the old humour when travelling;  I find it soothing to the nerves.\r\n\r\n Passing over the points at Manningtree the train gave a lurch, and a horse-shoe he had carefully placed in the rack above him slipped through the netting, falling with a musical ring upon his head.\r\n\r\n He appeared neither surprised nor angry.  Having staunched the wound with his handkerchief, he stooped and picked the horse-shoe up, glanced at it with, as I thought, an expression of reproach, and dropped it gently out of the window.\r\n\r\n \"Did it hurt you?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n It was a foolish question.  I told myself so the moment I had uttered it.  The thing must have weighed three pounds at the least;  it was an exceptionally large and heavy shoe.  The bump on his head was swelling visibly before my eyes.  Anyone but an idiot must have seen that he was hurt.  I expected an irritable reply.  I should have given one myself had I been in his place.  Instead, however, he seemed to regard the inquiry as a natural and kindly expression of sympathy.\r\n\r\n \"It did, a little,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n \"What were you doing with it?\"  I asked.  It was an odd sort of thing for a man to be travelling with.\r\n\r\n \"It was lying in the roadway just outside the station,\" he explained;  \"I picked it up for luck.\"\r\n\r\n He refolded his handkerchief so as to bring a cooler surface in contact with the swelling, while I murmured something genial about the inscrutability of Providence.\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"I've had a deal of luck in my time, but it's never turned out well.\"\r\n\r\n \"I was born on a Wednesday,\" he continued, \"which, as I daresay you know, is the luckiest day a man can be born on.  My mother was a widow, and none of my relatives would do anything for me.  They said it would be like taking coals to Newcastle, helping a boy born on a Wednesday;  and my uncle, when he died, left every penny of his money to my brother Sam, as a slight compensation to him for having been born on a Friday.  All I ever got was advice upon the duties and responsibilities of wealth, when it arrived, and entreaties that I would not neglect those with claims upon me when I came to be a rich man.\"\r\n\r\n He paused while folding up his various insurance papers and placing them in the inside breast-pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\n \"Then there are black cats,\" he went on;  \"they're said to be lucky.  Why, there never was a blacker cat than the one that followed me into my rooms in Bolsover Street the very first night I took them.\"\r\n\r\n \"Didn't it bring you luck?\"  I enquired, finding that he had stopped.\r\n\r\n A far-away look came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n \"Well, of course it all depends,\" he answered dreamily.  \"Maybe we'd never have suited one another;  you can always look at it that way.  Still, I'd like to have tried.\"\r\n\r\n He sat staring out of the window, and for a while I did not care to intrude upon his evidently painful memories.\r\n\r\n \"What happened then?\"  I asked, however, at last.\r\n\r\n He roused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n \"Oh,\" he said.  \"Nothing extraordinary.  She had to leave London for a time, and gave me her pet canary to take charge of while she was away.\"\r\n\r\n \"But it wasn't your fault,\" I urged.\r\n\r\n \"No, perhaps not,\" he agreed;  \"but it created a coldness which others were not slow to take advantage of.\"\r\n\r\n \"I offered her the cat, too,\" he added, but more to himself than to me.\r\n\r\n We sat and smoked in silence.  I felt that the consolations of a stranger would sound weak.\r\n\r\n \"Piebald horses are lucky, too,\" he observed, knocking the ashes from his pipe against the window sash.  \"I had one of them once.\"\r\n\r\n \"What did it do to you?\"  I enquired.\r\n\r\n \"Lost me the best crib I ever had in my life,\" was the simple rejoinder.  \"The governor stood it a good deal longer than I had any right to expect;  but you can't keep a man who is _always_ drunk.  It gives a firm a bad name.\"\r\n\r\n \"It would,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\n \"You see,\" he went on, \"I never had the head for it.  To some men it would not have so much mattered, but the very first glass was enough to upset me.  I'd never been used to it.\"\r\n\r\n \"But why did you take it?\"  I persisted.  \"The horse didn't make you drink, did he?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, it was this way,\" he explained, continuing to rub gently the lump which was now about the size of an egg.  \"The animal had belonged to a gentleman who travelled in the wine and spirit line, and who had been accustomed to visit in the way of business almost every public-house he came to.  The result was you couldn't get that little horse past a public- house—at least I couldn't.  He sighted them a quarter of a mile off, and made straight for the door.  I struggled with him at first, but it was five to ten minutes' work getting him away, and folks used to gather round and bet on us.  I think, maybe, I'd have stuck to it, however, if it hadn't been for a temperance chap who stopped one day and lectured the crowd about it from the opposite side of the street.  He called me Pilgrim, and said the little horse was 'Pollion,' or some such name, and kept on shouting out that I was to fight him for a heavenly crown.  After that they called us \"Polly and the Pilgrim, fighting for the crown.\"  It riled me, that did, and at the very next house at which he pulled up I got down and said I'd come for two of Scotch.  That was the beginning.  It took me years to break myself of the habit.\r\n\r\n \"But there,\" he continued, \"it has always been the same.  I hadn't been a fortnight in my first situation before my employer gave me a goose weighing eighteen pounds as a Christmas present.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, that couldn't have done you any harm,\" I remarked.  \"That was lucky enough.\"\r\n\r\n \"So the other clerks said at the time,\" he replied.  \"The old gentleman had never been known to give anything away before in his life.  'He's taken a fancy to you,' they said;  'you are a lucky beggar!'\"\r\n\r\n He sighed heavily.  I felt there was a story attached.\r\n\r\n \"What did you do with it?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n \"That was the trouble,\" he returned.  \"I didn't know what to do with it.  It was ten o'clock on Christmas Eve, just as I was leaving, that he gave it to me.  'Tiddling Brothers have sent me a goose, Biggles,' he said to me as I helped him on with his great-coat.  'Very kind of 'em, but I don't want it myself;  you can have it!'\r\n\r\n \"Of course I thanked him, and was very grateful.  He wished me a merry Christmas and went out.  I tied the thing up in brown paper, and took it under my arm.  It was a fine bird, but heavy.\r\n\r\n \"Under all the circumstances, and it being Christmas time, I thought I would treat myself to a glass of beer.  I went into a quiet little house at the corner of the Lane and laid the goose on the counter.\r\n\r\n \"'That's a big 'un,' said the landlord;  'you'll get a good cut off him to- morrow.'\r\n\r\n \"His words set me thinking, and for the first time it struck me that I didn't want the bird—that it was of no use to me at all.  I was going down to spend the holidays with my young lady's people in Kent.\"\r\n\r\n \"Was this the canary young lady?\"  I interrupted.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he replied.  \"This was before that one.  It was this goose I'm telling you of that upset this one.  Well, her folks were big farmers;  it would have been absurd taking a goose down to them, and I knew no one in London to give it to, so when the landlord came round again I asked him if he would care to buy it.  I told him he could have it cheap.\r\n\r\n \"'I don't want it myself,' he answered.  'I've got three in the house already.  Perhaps one of these gentlemen would like to make an offer.'\r\n\r\n \"He turned to a couple of chaps who were sitting drinking gin.  They didn't look to me worth the price of a chicken between them.  The seediest said he'd like to look at it, however, and I undid the parcel.  He mauled the thing pretty considerably, and cross-examined me as to how I come by it, ending by upsetting half a tumbler of gin and water over it.  Then he offered me half a crown for it.  It made me so angry that I took the brown paper and the string in one hand and the goose in the other, and walked straight out without saying a word.\r\n\r\n \"I carried it in this way for some distance, because I was excited and didn't care how I carried it;  but as I cooled, I began to reflect how ridiculous I must look.  One or two small boys evidently noticed the same thing.  I stopped under a lamp-post and tried to tie it up again.  I had a bag and an umbrella with me at the same time, and the first thing I did was to drop the goose into the gutter, which is just what I might have expected to do, attempting to handle four separate articles and three yards of string with one pair of hands.  I picked up about a quart of mud with that goose, and got the greater part of it over my hands and clothes and a fair quantity over the brown paper;  and then it began to rain.\r\n\r\n \"I bundled everything up into my arm and made for the nearest pub, where I thought I would ask for a piece more string and make a neat job of it.\r\n\r\n \"The bar was crowded.  I pushed my way to the counter and flung the goose down in front of me.  The men nearest stopped talking to look at it;  and a young fellow standing next to me said—\r\n\r\n \"'Well, you've killed it.'  I daresay I did seem a bit excited.\r\n\r\n \"I had intended making another effort to sell it here, but they were clearly not the right sort.  I had a pint of ale—for I was feeling somewhat tired and hot—scraped as much of the mud off the bird as I could, made a fresh parcel of it, and came out.\r\n\r\n \"Crossing the road a happy idea occurred to me.  I thought I would raffle it.  At once I set to work to find a house where there might seem to be a likely lot.  It cost me three or four whiskies—for I felt I didn't want any more beer, which is a thing that easily upsets me—but at length I found just the crowd I wanted—a quiet domestic-looking set in a homely little place off the Goswell Road.\r\n\r\n \"I explained my views to the landlord.  He said he had no objection;  he supposed I would stand drinks round afterwards.  I said I should be delighted to do so, and showed him the bird.\r\n\r\n \"'It looks a bit poorly,' he said.  He was a Devonshire man.\r\n\r\n \"'Oh, that's nothing,' I explained.  ' I happened to drop it.  That will all wash off.'\r\n\r\n \"'It smells a bit queer, too,' he said.\r\n\r\n \"'That's mud,' I answered;  'you know what London mud is.  And a gentleman spilled some gin over it.  Nobody will notice that when it's cooked.'\r\n\r\n \"'Well,' he replied.  ' I don't think I'll take a hand myself, but if any other gent likes to, that's his affair.'\r\n\r\n \"Nobody seemed enthusiastic.  I started it at sixpence, and took a ticket myself.  The potman had a free chance for superintending the arrangements, and he succeeded in inducing five other men, much against their will, to join us.  I won it myself, and paid out three and twopence for drinks.  A solemn-looking individual who had been snoring in a corner suddenly woke up as I was going out, and offered me sevenpence ha'penny for it—why sevenpence ha'penny I have never been able to understand.  He would have taken it away, I should never have seen it again, and my whole life might have been different.  But Fate has always been against me.  I replied, with perhaps unnecessary hauteur, that I wasn't a Christmas dinner fund for the destitute, and walked out.\r\n\r\n \"It was getting late, and I had a long walk home to my lodgings.  I was beginning to wish I had never seen the bird.  I estimated its weight by this time to be thirty-six pounds.\r\n\r\n \"The idea occurred to me to sell it to a poulterer.  I looked for a shop, I found one in Myddleton Street.  There wasn't a customer near it, but by the way the man was shouting you might have thought that he was doing all the trade of Clerkenwell.  I took the goose out of the parcel and laid it on the shelf before him.\r\n\r\n \"'What's this?'  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"'It's a goose,' I said.  'You can have it cheap.'\r\n\r\n \"He just seized the thing by the neck and flung it at me.  I dodged, and it caught the side of my head.  You can have no idea, if you've never been hit on the head with a goose, how if hurts.  I picked it up and hit him back with it, and a policeman came up with the usual, 'Now then, what's all this about?'\r\n\r\n \"I explained the facts.  The poulterer stepped to the edge of the curb and apostrophised the universe generally.\r\n\r\n \"'Look at that shop,' he said.  'It's twenty minutes to twelve, and there's seven dozen geese hanging there that I'm willing to give away, and this fool asks me if I want to buy another.'\r\n\r\n \"I perceived then that my notion had been a foolish one, and I followed the policeman's advice, and went away quietly, taking the bird with me.\r\n\r\n \"Then said I to myself, 'I will give it away.  I will select some poor deserving person, and make him a present of the damned thing.'  I passed a good many people, but no one looked deserving enough.  It may have been the time or it may have been the neighbourhood, but those I met seemed to me to be unworthy of the bird.  I offered it to a man in Judd Street, who I thought appeared hungry.  He turned out to be a drunken ruffian.  I could not make him understand what I meant, and he followed me down the road abusing me at the top of his voice, until, turning a corner without knowing it, he plunged down Tavistock Place, shouting after the wrong man.  In the Euston Road I stopped a half-starved child and pressed it upon her.  She answered 'Not me!'  and ran away.  I heard her calling shrilly after me, 'Who stole the goose?'\r\n\r\n \"I dropped it in a dark part of Seymour Street.  A man picked it up and brought it after me.  I was unequal to any more explanations or arguments.  I gave him twopence and plodded on with it once more.  The pubs were just closing, and I went into one for a final drink.  As a matter of fact I had had enough already, being, as I am, unaccustomed to anything more than an occasional class of beer.  But I felt depressed, and I thought it might cheer me.  I think I had gin, which is a thing I loathe.\r\n\r\n \"I meant to fling it over into Oakley Square, but a policeman had his eye on me, and followed me twice round the railings.  In Golding Road I sought to throw it down an area, but was frustrated in like manner.  The whole night police of London seemed to have nothing else to do but prevent my getting rid of that goose.\r\n\r\n \"They appeared so anxious about it that I fancied they might like to have it.  I went up to one in Camden Street.  I called him 'Bobby,' and asked him if he wanted a goose.\r\n\r\n \"'I'll tell you what I don't want,' he replied severely, 'and that is none of your sauce.'\r\n\r\n \"He was very insulting, and I naturally answered him back.  What actually passed I forget, but it ended in his announcing his intention of taking me in charge.\r\n\r\n \"I slipped out of his hands and bolted down King Street.  He blew his whistle and started after me.  A man sprang out from a doorway in College Street and tried to stop me.  I tied him up with a butt in the stomach, and cut through the Crescent, doubling back into the Camden Road by Batt Street.\r\n\r\n \"At the Canal Bridge I looked behind me, and could see no one.  I dropped the goose over the parapet, and it fell with a splash into the water.\r\n\r\n \"Heaving a sigh of relief, I turned and crossed into Randolph Street, and there a constable collared me.  I was arguing with him when the first fool came up breathless.  They told me I had better explain the matter to the Inspector, and I thought so too.\r\n\r\n \"The Inspector asked me why I had run away when the other constable wanted to take me in charge.  I replied that it was because I did not desire to spend my Christmas holidays in the lock-up, which he evidently regarded as a singularly weak argument.  He asked me what I had thrown into the canal.  I told him a goose.  He asked me why I had thrown a goose into the canal.  I told him because I was sick and tired of the animal.\r\n\r\n \"At this stage a sergeant came in to say that they had succeeded in recovering the parcel.  They opened it on the Inspector's table.  It contained a dead baby.\r\n\r\n \"I pointed out to them that it wasn't my parcel, and that it wasn't my baby, but they hardly took the trouble to disguise the fact that they did not believe me.\r\n\r\n \"The Inspector said it was too grave a case for bail, which, seeing that I did not know a soul in London, was somewhat immaterial.  I got them to send a telegram to my young lady to say that I was unavoidably detained in town, and passed as quiet and uneventful a Christmas Day and Boxing Day as I ever wish to spend.\r\n\r\n \"In the end the evidence against me was held to be insufficient to justify a conviction, and I got off on the minor charge of drunk and disorderly.  But I lost my situation and I lost my young lady, and I don't care if I never see a goose again.\"\r\n\r\n We were nearing Liverpool Street.  He collected his luggage, and taking up his hat made an attempt to put it on his head.  But in consequence of the swelling caused by the horseshoe it would not go anywhere near him, and he laid it sadly back upon the seat.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he said quietly, \"I can't say that I believe very much in luck.\""

        "text":"The first time we met, to speak, he was sitting with his back against a pollard willow, smoking a clay pipe.  He smoked it very slowly, but very conscientiously.  After each whiff he removed the pipe from his mouth and fanned away the smoke with his cap.\r\n\r\n \"Feeling bad?\"  I asked from behind a tree, at the same time making ready for a run, big boys' answers to small boys' impertinences being usually of the nature of things best avoided.\r\n\r\n To my surprise and relief—for at second glance I perceived I had under- estimated the length of his legs—he appeared to regard the question as a natural and proper one, replying with unaffected candour, \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n My desire became to comfort him—a sentiment I think he understood and was grateful for.  Advancing into the open, I sat down over against him, and watched him for a while in silence.  Presently he said:—\r\n\r\n \"Have you ever tried drinking beer?\"\r\n\r\n I admitted I had not.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, it is beastly stuff,\" he rejoined with an involuntary shudder.\r\n\r\n Rendered forgetful of present trouble by bitter recollection of the past, he puffed away at his pipe carelessly and without judgment.\r\n\r\n \"Do you often drink it?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" he replied gloomily;  \"all we fellows in the fifth form drink beer and smoke pipes.\"\r\n\r\n A deeper tinge of green spread itself over his face.\r\n\r\n He rose suddenly and made towards the hedge.  Before he reached it, however, he stopped and addressed me, but without turning round.\r\n\r\n \"If you follow me, young 'un, or look, I'll punch your head,\" he said swiftly, and disappeared with a gurgle.\r\n\r\n He left at the end of the terms and I did not see him again until we were both young men.  Then one day I ran against him in Oxford Street, and he asked me to come and spend a few days with his people in Surrey.\r\n\r\n I found him wan-looking and depressed, and every now and then he sighed.  During a walk across the common he cheered up considerably, but the moment we got back to the house door he seemed to recollect himself, and began to sigh again.  He ate no dinner whatever, merely sipping a glass of wine and crumbling a piece of bread.  I was troubled at noticing this, but his relatives—a maiden aunt, who kept house, two elder sisters, and a weak-eyed female cousin who had left her husband behind her in India—were evidently charmed.  They glanced at each other, and nodded and smiled.  Once in a fit of abstraction he swallowed a bit of crust, and immediately they all looked pained and surprised.\r\n\r\n In the drawing-room, under cover of a sentimental song, sung by the female cousin, I questioned his aunt on the subject.\r\n\r\n \"What's the matter with him?\"  I said.  \"Is he ill?\"\r\n\r\n The old lady chuckled.\r\n\r\n \"You'll be like that one day,\" she whispered gleefully.\r\n\r\n \"When,\" I asked, not unnaturally alarmed.\r\n\r\n \"When you're in love,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n \"Is _he_ in love?\"  I inquired after a pause.\r\n\r\n \"Can't you see he is?\"  she replied somewhat scornfully.\r\n\r\n I was a young man, and interested in the question.\r\n\r\n \"Won't he ever eat any dinner till he's got over it?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n She looked round sharply at me, but apparently decided that I was only foolish.\r\n\r\n \"You wait till your time comes,\" she answered, shaking her curls at me.  \"You won't care much about your dinner—not if you are _really_ in love.\"\r\n\r\n In the night, about half-past eleven, I heard, as I thought, footsteps in the passage, and creeping to the door and opening it I saw the figure of my friend in dressing-gown and slippers, vanishing down the stairs.  My idea was that, his brain weakened by trouble, he had developed sleep-walking tendencies.  Partly out of curiosity, partly to watch over him, I slipped on a pair of trousers and followed him.\r\n\r\n He placed his candle on the kitchen table and made a bee-line for the pantry door, from where he subsequently emerged with two pounds of cold beef on a plate and about a quart of beer in a jug;  and I came away, leaving him fumbling for pickles.\r\n\r\n I assisted at his wedding, where it seemed to me he endeavoured to display more ecstasy than it was possible for any human being to feel;  and fifteen months later, happening to catch sight of an advertisement in the births column of _The Times_, I called on my way home from the City to congratulate him.  He was pacing up and down the passage with his hat on, pausing at intervals to partake of an uninviting-looking meal, consisting of a cold mutton chop and a glass of lemonade, spread out upon a chair.  Seeing that the cook and the housemaid were wandering about the house evidently bored for want of something to do, and that the dining- room, where he would have been much more out of the way, was empty and quite in order, I failed at first to understand the reason for his deliberate choice of discomfort.  I, however, kept my reflections to myself, and inquired after the mother and child.\r\n\r\n \"Couldn't be better,\" he replied with a groan.  \"The doctor said he'd never had a more satisfactory case in all his experience.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, I'm glad to hear that,\" I answered;  \"I was afraid you'd been worrying yourself.\"\r\n\r\n \"Worried!\"  he exclaimed.  \"My dear boy, I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels\" (he gave one that idea).  \"This is the first morsel of food that's passed my lips for twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\n At this moment the nurse appeared at the top of the stairs.  He flew towards her, upsetting the lemonade in his excitement.\r\n\r\n \"What is it?\"  he asked hoarsely.  \"Is it all right?\"\r\n\r\n The old lady glanced from him to his cold chop, and smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n \"They're doing splendidly,\" she answered, patting him on the shoulder in a motherly fashion.  \"Don't you worry.\"\r\n\r\n \"I can't help it, Mrs. Jobson,\" he replied, sitting down upon the bottom stair, and leaning his head against the banisters.\r\n\r\n \"Of course you can't,\" said Mrs. Jobson admiringly;  \"and you wouldn't be much of a man if you could.\"  Then it was borne in upon me why he wore his hat, and dined off cold chops in the passage.\r\n\r\n The following summer they rented a picturesque old house in Berkshire, and invited me down from a Saturday to Monday.  Their place was near the river, so I slipped a suit of flannels in my bag, and on the Sunday morning I came down in them.  He met me in the garden.  He was dressed in a frock coat and a white waistcoat;  and I noticed that he kept looking at me out of the corner of his eye, and that he seemed to have a trouble on his mind.  The first breakfast bell rang, and then he said, \"You haven't got any proper clothes with you, have you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Proper clothes!\"  I exclaimed, stopping in some alarm.  \"Why, has anything given way?\"\r\n\r\n \"No, not that,\" he explained.  \"I mean clothes to go to church in.\"\r\n\r\n \"Church,\" I said.  \"You're surely not going to church a fine day like this?  I made sure you'd be playing tennis, or going on the river.  You always used to.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" he replied, nervously flicking a rose-bush with a twig he had picked up.  \"You see, it isn't ourselves exactly.  Maud and I would rather like to, but our cook, she's Scotch, and a little strict in her notions.\"\r\n\r\n \"And does she insist on your going to church every Sunday morning?\"  I inquired.\r\n\r\n \"Well,\" he answered, \"she thinks it strange if we don't, and so we generally do, just in the morning—and evening.  And then in the afternoon a few of the village girls drop in, and we have a little singing and that sort of thing.  I never like hurting anyone's feelings if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\n I did not say what I thought.  Instead I said, \"I've got that tweed suit I wore yesterday.  I can put that on if you like.\"\r\n\r\n He ceased flicking the rose-bush, and knitted his brows.  He seemed to be recalling it to his imagination.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he said, shaking his head, \"I'm afraid it would shock her.  It's my fault, I know,\" he added, remorsefully.  \"I ought to have told you.\"\r\n\r\n Then an idea came to him.\r\n\r\n \"I suppose,\" he said, \"you wouldn't care to pretend you were ill, and stop in bed just for the day?\"\r\n\r\n I explained that my conscience would not permit my being a party to such deception\r\n\r\n \"No, I thought you wouldn't,\" he replied.  \"I must explain it to her.  I think I'll say you've lost your bag.  I shouldn't like her to think bad of us.\"\r\n\r\n Later on a fourteenth cousin died, leaving him a large fortune.  He purchased an estate in Yorkshire, and became a \"county family,\" and then his real troubles began.\r\n\r\n From May to the middle of August, save for a little fly fishing, which generally resulted in his getting his feet wet and catching a cold, life was fairly peaceful;  but from early autumn to late spring he found the work decidedly trying.  He was a stout man, constitutionally nervous of fire-arms, and a six-hours' tramp with a heavy gun across ploughed fields, in company with a crowd of careless persons who kept blazing away within an inch of other people's noses, harassed and exhausted him.  He had to get out of bed at four on chilly October mornings to go cub-hunting, and twice a week throughout the winter—except when a blessed frost brought him a brief respite—he had to ride to hounds.  That he usually got off with nothing more serious than mere bruises and slight concussions of the spine, he probably owed to the fortunate circumstances of his being little and fat.  At stiff timber he shut his eyes and rode hard;  and ten yards from a river he would begin to think about bridges.\r\n\r\n Yet he never complained.\r\n\r\n \"If you are a country gentleman,\" he would say, \"you must behave as a country gentleman, and take the rough with the smooth.\"\r\n\r\n As ill fate would have it a chance speculation doubled his fortune, and it became necessary that he should go into Parliament and start a yacht.  Parliament made his head ache, and the yacht made him sick.  Notwithstanding, every summer he would fill it with a lot of expensive people who bored him, and sail away for a month's misery in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n During one cruise his guests built up a highly-interesting gambling scandal.  He himself was confined to his cabin at the time, and knew nothing about it;  but the Opposition papers, getting hold of the story, referred casually to the yacht as a \"floating hell,\" and _The Police News_ awarded his portrait the place of honour as the chief criminal of the week.\r\n\r\n Later on he got into a cultured set, ruled by a thick-lipped undergraduate.  His favourite literature had hitherto been of the Corelli and _Tit-Bits_ order, but now he read Meredith and the yellow book, and tried to understand them;  and instead of the Gaiety, he subscribed to the Independent Theatre, and fed \"his soul,\" on Dutch Shakespeares.  What he liked in art was a pretty girl by a cottage-door with an eligible young man in the background, or a child and a dog doing something funny.  They told him these things were wrong and made him buy \"Impressions\" that stirred his liver to its deepest depths every time he looked at them—green cows on red hills by pink moonlight, or scarlet-haired corpses with three feet of neck.\r\n\r\n He said meekly that such seemed to him unnatural, but they answered that nature had nothing to do with the question;  that the artist saw things like that, and that whatever an artist saw—no matter in what condition he may have been when he saw it—that was art.\r\n\r\n They took him to Wagner festivals and Burne-Jones's private views.  They read him all the minor poets.  They booked seats for him at all Ibsen's plays.  They introduced him into all the most soulful circles of artistic society.  His days were one long feast of other people's enjoyments.\r\n\r\n One morning I met him coming down the steps of the Arts Club.  He looked weary.  He was just off to a private view at the New Gallery.  In the afternoon he had to attend an amateur performance of \"The Cenci,\" given by the Shelley Society.  Then followed three literary and artistic At Homes, a dinner with an Indian nabob who couldn't speak a word of English, \"Tristam and Isolde\" at Covent Garden Theatre, and a ball at Lord Salisbury's to wind up the day.\r\n\r\n I laid my hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n \"Come with me to Epping Forest,\" I said.  \"There's a four-horse brake starts from Charing Cross at eleven.  It's Saturday, and there's bound to be a crowd down there.  I'll play you a game of skittles, and we will have a shy at the cocoa-nuts.  You used to be rather smart at cocoa-nuts.  We can have lunch there and be back at seven, dine at the Troc., spend the evening at the Empire, and sup at the Savoy.  What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n He stood hesitating on the steps, a wistful look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n His brougham drew up against the curb, and he started as if from a dream.\r\n\r\n \"My dear fellow,\" he replied, \"what would people say?\"  And shaking me by the hand, he took his seat, and the footman slammed the door upon him."

        "text":"I first met Jack Burridge nearly ten years ago on a certain North-country race-course.\r\n\r\n The saddling bell had just rung for the chief event of the day.  I was sauntering along with my hands in my pockets, more interested in the crowd than in the race, when a sporting friend, crossing on his way to the paddock, seized me by the arm and whispered hoarsely in my ear:—\r\n\r\n \"Put your shirt on Mrs. Waller.\"\r\n\r\n \"Put my—?\"  I began.\r\n\r\n \"Put your shirt on Mrs. Waller,\" he repeated still more impressively, and disappeared in the throng.\r\n\r\n I stared after him in blank amazement.  Why should I put my shirt on Mrs. Waller?  Even if it would fit a lady.  And how about myself?\r\n\r\n I was passing the grand stand, and, glancing up, I saw \"Mrs.  Waller, twelve to one,\" chalked on a bookmaker's board.  Then it dawned upon me that \"Mrs.  Waller\" was a horse, and, thinking further upon the matter, I evolved the idea that my friend's advice, expressed in more becoming language, was \"Back 'Mrs.  Waller' for as much as you can possibly afford.\"\r\n\r\n \"Thank you,\" I said to myself, \"I have backed cast-iron certainties before.  Next time I bet upon a horse I shall make the selection by shutting my eyes and putting a pin through the card.\"\r\n\r\n But the seed had taken root.  My friend's words surged in my brain.  The birds passing overhead twittered, \"Put your shirt on 'Mrs.  Waller.'\"\r\n\r\n I reasoned with myself.  I reminded myself of my few former ventures.  But the craving to put, if not my shirt, at all events half a sovereign on \"Mrs.  Waller\" only grew the stronger the more strongly I battled against it.  I felt that if \"Mrs.  Waller\" won and I had nothing on her, I should reproach myself to my dying day.\r\n\r\n I was on the other side of the course.  There was no time to get back to the enclosure.  The horses were already forming for the start.  A few yards off, under a white umbrella, an outside bookmaker was shouting his final prices in stentorian tones.  He was a big, genial-looking man, with an honest red face.\r\n\r\n \"What price 'Mrs.  Waller'?\"  I asked him.\r\n\r\n \"Fourteen to one,\" he answered, \"and good luck to you.\"\r\n\r\n I handed him half a sovereign, and he wrote me out a ticket.  I crammed it into my waistcoat pocket, and hurried off to see the race.  To my intense astonishment \"Mrs.  Waller\" won.  The novel sensation of having backed the winner so excited me that I forgot all about my money, and it was not until a good hour afterwards that I recollected my bet.\r\n\r\n Then I started off to search for the man under the white umbrella.  I went to where I thought I had left him, but no white umbrella could I find.\r\n\r\n Consoling myself with the reflection that my loss served me right for having been fool enough to trust an outside \"bookie,\" I turned on my heel and began to make my way back to my seat.  Suddenly a voice hailed me:—\r\n\r\n \"Here you are, sir.  It's Jack Burridge you want.  Over here, sir.\"\r\n\r\n I looked round, and there was Jack Burridge at my elbow.\r\n\r\n \"I saw you looking about, sir,\" he said, \"but I could not make you hear.  You was looking the wrong side of the tent.\"\r\n\r\n It was pleasant to find that his honest face had not belied him.\r\n\r\n \"It is very good of you,\" I said;  \"I had given up all hopes of seeing you.  Or,\" I added with a smile, \"my seven pounds.\"\r\n\r\n \"Seven pun' ten,\" he corrected me;  \"you're forgetting your own thin 'un.\"\r\n\r\n He handed me the money and went back to his stand.\r\n\r\n On my way into the town I came across him again.  A small crowd was collected, thoughtfully watching a tramp knocking about a miserable-looking woman.\r\n\r\n Jack, pushing to the front, took in the scene and took off his coat in the same instant.\r\n\r\n \"Now then, my fine old English gentleman,\" he sang out, \"come and have a try at me for a change.\"\r\n\r\n The tramp was a burly ruffian, and I have seen better boxers than Jack.  He got himself a black eye, and a nasty cut over the lip, before he hardly knew where he was.  But in spite of that—and a good deal more—he stuck to his man and finished him.\r\n\r\n At the end, as he helped his adversary up, I heard him say to the fellow in a kindly whisper:—\r\n\r\n \"You're too good a sort, you know, to whollop a woman.  Why, you very near give me a licking.  You must have forgot yourself, matey.\"\r\n\r\n The fellow interested me.  I waited and walked on with him.  He told me about his home in London, at Mile End—about his old father and mother, his little brothers and sisters—and what he was saving up to do for them.  Kindliness oozed from every pore in his skin.\r\n\r\n Many that we met knew him, and all, when they saw his round, red face, smiled unconsciously.  At the corner of the High Street a pale-faced little drudge of a girl passed us, saying as she slipped by \"Good-evening, Mr. Burridge.\"\r\n\r\n He made a dart and caught her by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n \"And how is father?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, if you please, Mr. Burridge, he is out again.  All the mills is closed,\" answered the child.\r\n\r\n \"And mother?\"\r\n\r\n \"She don't get no better, sir.\"\r\n\r\n \"And who's keeping you all?\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, if you please, sir, Jimmy's earning something now,\" replied the mite.\r\n\r\n He took a couple of sovereigns from his waistcoat pocket, and closed the child's hand upon them.\r\n\r\n \"That's all right, my lass, that's all right,\" he said, stopping her stammering thanks.  \"You write to me if things don't get better.  You know where to find Jack Burridge.\"\r\n\r\n Strolling about the streets in the evening, I happened to pass the inn where he was staying.  The parlour window was open, and out into the misty night his deep, cheery voice, trolling forth an old-fashioned drinking song, came rolling like a wind, cleansing the corners of one's heart with its breezy humanness.  He was sitting at the head of the table surrounded by a crowd of jovial cronies.  I lingered for a while watching the scene.  It made the world appear a less sombre dwelling-place than I had sometimes pictured it.\r\n\r\n I determined, on my return to London, to look him up, and accordingly one evening started to find the little by-street off the Mile End Road in which he lived.  As I turned the corner he drove up in his dog-cart;  it was a smart turn-out.  On the seat beside him sat a neat, withered little old woman, whom he introduced to me as his mother.\r\n\r\n \"I tell 'im it's a fine gell as 'e oughter 'ave up 'ere aside 'im,\" said the old lady, preparing to dismount, \"an old woman like me takes all the paint off the show.\"\r\n\r\n \"Get along with yer,\" he replied laughingly, jumping down and handing the reins to the lad who had been waiting, \"you could give some of the young uns points yet, mother.  I allus promised the old lady as she should ride behind her own 'oss one day,\" he continued, turning to me, \"didn't I, mother?\"\r\n\r\n \"Ay, ay,\" replied the old soul, as she hobbled nimbly up the steps, \"ye're a good son, Jack, ye're a good son.\"\r\n\r\n He led the way into the parlour.  As he entered every face lightened up with pleasure, a harmony of joyous welcome greeted him.  The old hard world had been shut out with the slam of the front door.  I seemed to have wandered into Dickensland.  The red-faced man with the small twinkling eyes and the lungs of leather loomed before me, a large, fat household fairy.  From his capacious pockets came forth tobacco for the old father;  a huge bunch of hot-house grapes for a neighbour's sickly child, who was stopping with them;  a book of Henty's—beloved of boys—for a noisy youngster who called him \"uncle\";  a bottle of port wine for a wan, elderly woman with a swollen face—his widowed sister-in-law, as I subsequently learned;  sweets enough for the baby (whose baby I don't know) to make it sick for a week;  and a roll of music for his youngest sister.\r\n\r\n \"We're a-going to make a lady of her,\" he said, drawing the child's shy face against his gaudy waistcoat, and running his coarse hand through her pretty curls;  \"and she shall marry a jockey when she grows up.\"\r\n\r\n After supper he brewed some excellent whisky punch, and insisted upon the old lady joining us, which she eventually did with much coughing and protestation;  but I noticed that she finished the tumblerful.  For the children he concocted a marvellous mixture, which he called an \"eye-composer,\" the chief ingredients being hot lemonade, ginger wine, sugar, oranges, and raspberry vinegar.  It had the desired effect.\r\n\r\n I stayed till late, listening to his inexhaustible fund of stories.  Over most of them he laughed with us himself—a great gusty laugh that made the cheap glass ornaments upon the mantelpiece to tremble;  but now and then a recollection came to him that spread a sudden gravity across his jovial face, bringing a curious quaver into his deep voice.\r\n\r\n Their tongues a little loosened by the punch, the old folks would have sung his praises to the verge of tediousness had he not almost sternly interrupted them.\r\n\r\n \"Shut up, mother,\" he cried at last, quite gruffly, \"what I does I does to please myself.  I likes to see people comfortable about me.  If they wasn't, it's me as would be more upset than them.\"\r\n\r\n I did not see him again for nearly two years.  Then one October evening, strolling about the East End, I met him coming out of a little Chapel in the Burdett Road.  He was so changed that I should not have known him had not I overheard a woman as she passed him say, \"Good-evening, Mr. Burridge.\"\r\n\r\n A pair of bushy side-whiskers had given to his red face an aggressively respectable appearance.  He was dressed in an ill-fitting suit of black, and carried an umbrella in one hand and a book in the other.\r\n\r\n In some mysterious way he managed to look both thinner and shorter than my recollection of him.  Altogether, he suggested to me the idea that he himself—the real man—had by some means or other been extracted, leaving only his shrunken husk behind.  The genial juices of humanity had been squeezed out of him.\r\n\r\n \"Not Jack Burridge!\"  I exclaimed, confronting him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n His little eyes wandered shiftily up and down the street.  \"No, sir,\" he replied (his tones had lost their windy boisterousness—a hard, metallic voice spoke to me), \"not the one as you used to know, praise be the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n \"And have you given up the old business?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir,\" he replied, \"that's all over;  I've been a vile sinner in my time, God forgive me for it.  But, thank Heaven, I have repented in time.\"\r\n\r\n \"Come and have a drink,\" I said, slipping my arm through his, \"and tell me all about it.\"\r\n\r\n He disengaged himself from me, firmly but gently.  \"You mean well, sir,\" he said, \"but I have given up the drink.\"\r\n\r\n Evidently he would have been rid of me, but a literary man, scenting material for his stockpot, is not easily shaken off.  I asked after the old folks, and if they were still stopping with him.\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"for the present.  Of course, a man can't be expected to keep people for ever;  so many mouths to fill is hard work these times, and everybody sponges on a man just because he's good-natured.\"\r\n\r\n \"And how are you getting on?\"  I asked.\r\n\r\n \"Tolerably well, thank you, sir.  The Lord provides for His servants,\" he replied with a smug smile.  \"I have got a little shop now in the Commercial Road.\"\r\n\r\n \"Whereabouts?\"  I persisted.  \"I would like to call and see you.\"\r\n\r\n He gave me the address reluctantly, and said he would esteem it a great pleasure if I would honour him by a visit, which was a palpable lie.\r\n\r\n The following afternoon I went.  I found the place to be a pawnbroker's shop, and from all appearances he must have been doing a very brisk business.  He was out himself attending a temperance committee, but his old father was behind the counter, and asked me inside.  Though it was a chilly day there was no fire in the parlour, and the two old folks sat one each side of the empty hearth, silent and sad.  They seemed little more pleased to see me than their son, but after a while Mrs. Burridge's natural garrulity asserted itself, and we fell into chat.\r\n\r\n I asked what had become of his sister-in-law, the lady with the swollen face.\r\n\r\n \"I couldn't rightly tell you, sir,\" answered the old lady, \"she ain't livin' with us now.  You see, sir,\" she continued, \"John's got different notions to what 'e used to 'ave.  'E don't cotten much to them as ain't found grace, and poor Jane never did 'ave much religion!\"\r\n\r\n \"And the little one?\"  I inquired.  \"The one with the curls?\"\r\n\r\n \"What, Bessie, sir?\"  said the old lady.  \"Oh, she's out at service, sir;  John don't think it good for young folks to be idle.\"\r\n\r\n \"Your son seems to have changed a good deal, Mrs. Burridge,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n \"Ay, sir,\" she assented, \"you may well say that.  It nearly broke my 'art at fust;  everythin' so different to what it 'ad been.  Not as I'd stand in the boy's light.  If our being a bit uncomfortable like in this world is a-going to do 'im any good in the next me and father ain't the ones to begrudge it, are we, old man?\"\r\n\r\n The \"old man\" concurred grumpily.\r\n\r\n \"Was it a sudden conversion?\"  I asked.  \"How did it come about?\"\r\n\r\n \"It was a young woman as started 'im off,\" explained the old lady.  \"She come round to our place one day a-collectin' for somethin' or other, and Jack, in 'is free-'anded way, 'e give 'er a five-pun' note.  Next week she come agen for somethin' else, and stopped and talked to 'im about 'is soul in the passage.  She told 'im as 'e was a-goin' straight to 'ell, and that 'e oughter give up the bookmakin' and settle down to a respec'ble, God-fearin' business.  At fust 'e only laughed, but she lammed in tracts at 'im full of the most awful language;  and one day she fetched 'im round to one of them revivalist chaps, as fair settled 'im.\r\n\r\n \"'E ain't never been his old self since then.  ' E give up the bettin' and bought this 'ere, though what's the difference blessed if I can see.  It makes my 'eart ache, it do, to 'ear my Jack a-beatin' down the poor people—and it ain't like 'im.  It went agen 'is grain at fust, I could see;  but they told him as 'ow it was folks's own fault that they was poor, and as 'ow it was the will of God, because they was a drinkin', improvident lot.\r\n\r\n \"Then they made 'im sign the pledge.  'E'd allus been used to 'is glass, Jack 'ad, and I think as knockin' it off 'ave soured 'im a bit—seems as if all the sperit 'ad gone out of 'im—and of course me and father 'ave 'ad to give up our little drop too.  Then they told 'im as 'e must give up smokin'- that was another way of goin' straight to 'ell—and that ain't made 'im any the more cheerful like, and father misses 'is little bit—don't ye, father?\"\r\n\r\n \"Ay,\" answered the old fellow savagely;  \"can't say I thinks much of these 'ere folks as is going to heaven;  blowed if I don't think they'll be a chirpier lot in t'other place.\"\r\n\r\n An angry discussion in the shop interrupted us.  Jack had returned, and was threatening an excited woman with the police.  It seemed she had miscalculated the date, and had come a day too late with her interest.\r\n\r\n Having got rid of her, he came into the parlour with the watch in his hand.\r\n\r\n \"It's providential she was late,\" he said, looking at it;  \"it's worth ten times what I lent on it.\"\r\n\r\n He packed his father back into the shop, and his mother down into the kitchen to get his tea, and for a while we sat together talking.\r\n\r\n I found his conversation a strange mixture of self-laudation, showing through a flimsy veil of self-disparagement, and of satisfaction at the conviction that he was \"saved,\" combined with equally evident satisfaction that most other people weren't—somewhat trying, however;  and, remembering an appointment, rose to go.\r\n\r\n He made no effort to stay me, but I could see that he was bursting to tell me something.  At last, taking a religious paper from his pocket, and pointing to a column, he blurted out:\r\n\r\n\"You don't take any interest in the Lord's vineyard, I suppose, sir?\"\r\n\r\n I glanced at the part of the paper indicated.  It announced a new mission to the Chinese, and heading the subscription list stood the name, \"Mr.  John Burridge, one hundred guineas.\"\r\n\r\n \"You subscribe largely, Mr. Burridge,\" I said, handing him back the paper.\r\n\r\n He rubbed his big hands together.  \"The Lord will repay a hundredfold,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n \"In which case it's just as well to have a note of the advance down in black and white, eh?\"  I added.\r\n\r\n His little eyes looked sharply at me;  but he made no reply, and, shaking hands, I left him."

        "text":" So they wrote upon each other's programme and exchanged again.  The name she had written was Alice Blatchley.\r\n\r\n He had never seen her before, that he could remember.  Yet at the back of his mind there dwelt the haunting knowledge of her.  Somewhere long ago they had met, talked together.  Slowly, as one recalls a dream, it came back to him.  In some other life, vague, shadowy, he had married this woman.  For the first few years they had loved each other;  then the gulf had opened between them, widened.  Stern, strong voices had called to him to lay aside his selfish dreams, his boyish ambitions, to take upon his shoulders the yoke of a great duty.  When more than ever he had demanded sympathy and help, this woman had fallen away from him.  His ideals but irritated her.  Only at the cost of daily bitterness had he been able to resist her endeavours to draw him from his path.  A face—that of a woman with soft eyes, full of helpfulness, shone through the mist of his dream—the face of a woman who would one day come to him out of the Future with outstretched hands that he would yearn to clasp.\r\n\r\n \"Shall we not dance?\"  said the voice beside him.  \"I really won't sit out a waltz.\"\r\n\r\n They hurried into the ball-room.  With his arm about her form, her wondrous eyes shyly, at rare moments, seeking his, then vanishing again behind their drooping lashes, the brain, the mind, the very soul of the young man passed out of his own keeping.  She complimented him in her bewitching manner, a delightful blending of condescension and timidity.\r\n\r\n \"You dance extremely well,\" she told him.  \"You may ask me for another, later on.\"\r\n\r\n The words flashed out from that dim haunting future.  \"Your dancing was your chief attraction for me, as likely as not, had I but known?\"\r\n\r\n All that evening and for many months to come the Present and the Future fought within him.  And the experience of Nathaniel Armitage, divinity student, was the experience likewise of Alice Blatchley, who had fallen in love with him at first sight, having found him the divinest dancer she had ever whirled with to the sensuous music of the waltz;  of Horatio Camelford, journalist and minor poet, whose journalism earned him a bare income, but at whose minor poetry critics smiled;  of Jessica Dearwood, with her glorious eyes, and muddy complexion, and her wild hopeless passion for the big, handsome, ruddy-bearded Dick Everett, who, knowing it, only laughed at her in his kindly, lordly way, telling her with frank brutalness that the woman who was not beautiful had missed her vocation in life;  of that scheming, conquering young gentleman himself, who at twenty-five had already made his mark in the City, shrewd, clever, cool-headed as a fox, except where a pretty face and shapely hand or ankle were concerned;  of Nellie Fanshawe, then in the pride of her ravishing beauty, who loved none but herself, whose clay-made gods were jewels, and fine dresses and rich feasts, the envy of other women and the courtship of all mankind.\r\n\r\n That evening of the ball each clung to the hope that this memory of the future was but a dream.  They had been introduced to one another;  had heard each other's names for the first time with a start of recognition;  had avoided one another's eyes;  had hastened to plunge into meaningless talk;  till that moment when young Camelford, stooping to pick up Jessica's fan, had found that broken fragment of the Rhenish wine-glass.  Then it was that conviction refused to be shaken off, that knowledge of the future had to be sadly accepted.\r\n\r\n What they had not foreseen was that knowledge of the future in no way affected their emotions of the present.  Nathaniel Armitage grew day by day more hopelessly in love with bewitching Alice Blatchley.  The thought of her marrying anyone else—the long-haired, priggish Camelford in particular—sent the blood boiling through his veins;  added to which sweet Alice, with her arms about his neck, would confess to him that life without him would be a misery hardly to be endured, that the thought of him as the husband of another woman—of Nellie Fanshawe in particular—was madness to her.  It was right perhaps, knowing what they did, that they should say good-bye to one another.  She would bring sorrow into his life.  Better far that he should put her away from him, that she should die of a broken heart, as she felt sure she would.  How could he, a fond lover, inflict this suffering upon her?  He ought of course to marry Nellie Fanshawe, but he could not bear the girl.  Would it not be the height of absurdity to marry a girl he strongly disliked because twenty years hence she might be more suitable to him than the woman he now loved and who loved him?\r\n\r\n Nor could Nellie Fanshawe bring herself to discuss without laughter the suggestion of marrying on a hundred-and-fifty a year a curate that she positively hated.  There would come a time when wealth would be indifferent to her, when her exalted spirit would ask but for the satisfaction of self-sacrifice.  But that time had not arrived.  The emotions it would bring with it she could not in her present state even imagine.  Her whole present being craved for the things of this world, the things that were within her grasp.  To ask her to forego them now because later on she would not care for them!  it was like telling a schoolboy to avoid the tuck-shop because, when a man, the thought of stick-jaw would be nauseous to him.  If her capacity for enjoyment was to be short-lived, all the more reason for grasping joy quickly.\r\n\r\n Alice Blatchley, when her lover was not by, gave herself many a headache trying to think the thing out logically.  Was it not foolish of her to rush into this marriage with dear Nat?  At forty she would wish she had married somebody else.  But most women at forty—she judged from conversation round about her—wished they had married somebody else.  If every girl at twenty listened to herself at forty there would be no more marriage.  At forty she would be a different person altogether.  That other elderly person did not interest her.  To ask a young girl to spoil her life purely in the interests of this middle-aged party—it did not seem right.  Besides, whom else was she to marry?  Camelford would not have her;  he did not want her then;  he was not going to want her at forty.  For practical purposes Camelford was out of the question.  She might marry somebody else altogether—and fare worse.  She might remain a spinster: she hated the mere name of spinster.  The inky-fingered woman journalist that, if all went well, she might become: it was not her idea.  Was she acting selfishly?  Ought she, in his own interests, to refuse to marry dear Nat?  Nellie—the little cat—who would suit him at forty, would not have him.  If he was going to marry anyone but Nellie he might as well marry her, Alice.  A bachelor clergyman!  it sounded almost improper.  Nor was dear Nat the type.  If she threw him over it would be into the arms of some designing minx.  What was she to do?\r\n\r\n Camelford at forty, under the influence of favourable criticism, would have persuaded himself he was a heaven-sent prophet, his whole life to be beautifully spent in the saving of mankind.  At twenty he felt he wanted to live.  Weird-looking Jessica, with her magnificent eyes veiling mysteries, was of more importance to him than the rest of the species combined.  Knowledge of the future in his ease only spurred desire.  The muddy complexion would grow pink and white, the thin limbs round and shapely;  the now scornful eyes would one day light with love at his coming.  It was what he had once hoped: it was what he now knew.  At forty the artist is stronger than the man;  at twenty the man is stronger than the artist.\r\n\r\n An uncanny creature, so most folks would have described Jessica Dearwood.  Few would have imagined her developing into the good-natured, easy-going Mrs. Camelford of middle age.  The animal, so strong within her at twenty, at thirty had burnt itself out.  At eighteen, madly, blindly in love with red-bearded, deep-voiced Dick Everett she would, had he whistled to her, have flung herself gratefully at his feet, and this in spite of the knowledge forewarning her of the miserable life he would certainly lead her, at all events until her slowly developing beauty should give her the whip hand of him—by which time she would have come to despise him.  Fortunately, as she told herself, there was no fear of his doing so, the future notwithstanding.  Nellie Fanshawe's beauty held him as with chains of steel, and Nellie had no intention of allowing her rich prize to escape her.  Her own lover, it was true, irritated her more than any man she had ever met, but at least he would afford her refuge from the bread of charity.  Jessica Dearwood, an orphan, had been brought up by a distant relative.  She had not been the child to win affection.  Of silent, brooding nature, every thoughtless incivility had been to her an insult, a wrong.  Acceptance of young Camelford seemed her only escape from a life that had become to her a martyrdom.  At forty-one he would wish he had remained a bachelor;  but at thirty-eight that would not trouble her.  She would know herself he was much better off as he was.  Meanwhile, she would have come to like him, to respect him.  He would be famous, she would be proud of him.  Crying into her pillow—she could not help it—for love of handsome Dick, it was still a comfort to reflect that Nellie Fanshawe, as it were, was watching over her, protecting her from herself.\r\n\r\n Dick, as he muttered to himself a dozen times a day, ought to marry Jessica.  At thirty-eight she would be his ideal.  He looked at her as she was at eighteen, and shuddered.  Nellie at thirty would be plain and uninteresting.  But when did consideration of the future ever cry halt to passion: when did a lover ever pause thinking of the morrow?  If her beauty was to quickly pass, was not that one reason the more urging him to possess it while it lasted?\r\n\r\n Nellie Fanshawe at forty would be a saint.  The prospect did not please her: she hated saints.  She would love the tiresome, solemn Nathaniel: of what use was that to her now?  He did not desire her;  he was in love with Alice, and Alice was in love with him.  What would be the sense—even if they all agreed—in the three of them making themselves miserable for all their youth that they might be contented in their old age?  Let age fend for itself and leave youth to its own instincts.  Let elderly saints suffer—it was their _metier_—and youth drink the cup of life.  It was a pity Dick was the only \"catch\" available, but he was young and handsome.  Other girls had to put up with sixty and the gout.\r\n\r\n Another point, a very serious point, had been overlooked.  All that had arrived to them in that dim future of the past had happened to them as the results of their making the marriages they had made.  To what fate other roads would lead their knowledge could not tell them.  Nellie Fanshawe had become at forty a lovely character.  Might not the hard life she had led with her husband—a life calling for continual sacrifice, for daily self-control—have helped towards this end?  As the wife of a poor curate of high moral principles, would the same result have been secured?  The fever that had robbed her of her beauty and turned her thoughts inward had been the result of sitting out on the balcony of the Paris Opera House with an Italian Count on the occasion of a fancy dress ball.  As the wife of an East End clergyman the chances are she would have escaped that fever and its purifying effects.  Was there not danger in the position: a supremely beautiful young woman, worldly-minded, hungry for pleasure, condemned to a life of poverty with a man she did not care for?  The influence of Alice upon Nathaniel Armitage, during those first years when his character was forming, had been all for good.  Could he be sure that, married to Nellie, he might not have deteriorated?\r\n\r\n Were Alice Blatchley to marry an artist could she be sure that at forty she would still be in sympathy with artistic ideals?  Even as a child had not her desire ever been in the opposite direction to that favoured by her nurse?  Did not the reading of Conservative journals invariably incline her towards Radicalism, and the steady stream of Radical talk round her husband's table invariably set her seeking arguments in favour of the feudal system?  Might it not have been her husband's growing Puritanism that had driven her to crave for Bohemianism?  Suppose that towards middle age, the wife of a wild artist, she suddenly \"took religion,\" as the saying is.  Her last state would be worse than the first.\r\n\r\n Camelford was of delicate physique.  As an absent-minded bachelor with no one to give him his meals, no one to see that his things were aired, could he have lived till forty?  Could he be sure that home life had not given more to his art than it had taken from it?\r\n\r\n Jessica Dearwood, of a nervous, passionate nature, married to a bad husband, might at forty have posed for one of the Furies.  Not until her life had become restful had her good looks shown themselves.  Hers was the type of beauty that for its development demands tranquillity.\r\n\r\n Dick Everett had no delusions concerning himself.  That, had he married Jessica, he could for ten years have remained the faithful husband of a singularly plain wife he knew to be impossible.  But Jessica would have been no patient Griselda.  The extreme probability was that having married her at twenty for the sake of her beauty at thirty, at twenty-nine at latest she would have divorced him.\r\n\r\n Everett was a man of practical ideas.  It was he who took the matter in hand.  The refreshment contractor admitted that curious goblets of German glass occasionally crept into their stock.  One of the waiters, on the understanding that in no case should he be called upon to pay for them, admitted having broken more than one wine-glass on that particular evening: thought it not unlikely he might have attempted to hide the fragments under a convenient palm.  The whole thing evidently was a dream.  So youth decided at the time, and the three marriages took place within three months of one another.\r\n\r\n It was some ten years later that Armitage told me the story that night in the Club smoking-room.  Mrs. Everett had just recovered from a severe attack of rheumatic fever, contracted the spring before in Paris.  Mrs. Camelford, whom previously I had not met, certainly seemed to me one of the handsomest women I have ever seen.  Mrs. Armitage—I knew her when she was Alice Blatchley—I found more charming as a woman than she had been as a girl.  What she could have seen in Armitage I never could understand.  Camelford made his mark some ten years later: poor fellow, he did not live long to enjoy his fame.  Dick Everett has still another six years to work off;  but he is well behaved, and there is talk of a petition.\r\n\r\n It is a curious story altogether, I admit.  As I said at the beginning, I do not myself believe it."

        "text":"As we enter the new millennium, more and more businesses are deciding to go along with building what is called sites on the world wide web, better known as a web site.  It seems as though these days to many people is that all you have to do is build a web site and you are set to go.  Being as upfront as possible there is an extreme downside to this method.  Just building the web site will not bring anybody to the web site.  To get people to visit a web site certain processes have to be taken to promote the web site.  There are numerous ways out there to promote a web site.\r\n\r\n One very common and successful way to bring visitors to a web site is to send out direct electronic mail or commonly known as email.  This is a very simple process in general.  It simply consists of sending out emails at random or premeditated if you have the time.  The emails need to contain a short paragraph describing a little about your web site and what it has to offer to those who visit the web site.  Remember that with this method it is wise to not be too wordy otherwise this process can develop to be very time consuming and irritating to the sender and the receiver of the email.  However it is possible to email well over 10,000 emails in just under an hour.  This process can only be done if everything has been thought out thoroughly and ready to go before the process has even begun.  Another possible advantage to this method is that the recipient of the email may enjoy the site and forward the same email to people that they know.  Emails also cost nothing if there is already access to the World Wide Web through an ISP (Internet Service Provider).  This method is the most commonly used and it can and does work.\r\n\r\n A very similar way but much less direct method is simply to attach a signature to the end of outgoing emails.  Most email providers offer this option.  It simply means that at the end of outgoing email that is sent out there will be a message of individual choice at the bottom of the email where a signature would normally be on a hand written letter, thus giving it the name signature.  What the message says is entirely up to the sender of the email.  It is recommended that more than one signature be provided to pertain to different types of people that are emailed.  The message should include your web site name, address, and a short catchy little phrase to catch the eye.\r\n\r\n Another method of promoting a web site is to enter the site in a search engine.  A few examples of search engines are Yahoo, Alta Vista, Excite, Lycos, Infoseek, and Webcrawler.  The whole process in itself is very easy but it takes time and patience.  An application is provided for individuals by the search engine.  The application requests name, web site name, web site address, a description of the web site, what kind of site it is, a list of key words, and what category would be desired for placement of the web site.  Always double check to see what the search engine did with what they were given.  Check to see where the site was placed and to see if the site was placed at all.  «Perhaps as many as 50 percent of all submissions are rejected».  If for some reason or another the site wasn’t posted simply keep reapplying.  Be persistent and keep registering but each time use different key words.  Eventually the site will be posted.\r\n\r\n An approach to promoting your site that does work quite well on a regular basis is to advertise by using banners and ads that link to the web site that is being promoted.  The downside to this method is that it does get expensive.  It is simple though.  Simply come up with a banner design that is catchy and convince other web sites to carry the banner.  Usually they will not do it for free so it is best to offer them a sum of money to carry the banner for a certain amount of time.  Then negotiate down to what meets both web site’s needs.  Many sites will offer a chance to place an ad on their web site if in return the person desiring the ad placement will apply the web sites ad on their web site.  This works well if it has the opportunity to have this setup with multiple web sites.\r\n\r\n There is another way and that is to apply to what is known as a link page.  This is a web site that consists of only links to other web pages.  Usually all the web pages have something in common with each other.  Convincing the link page to accept the offer to contain the web site link to the site that is currently being promoted is easy although sometimes there is a small fee.\r\n\r\n The internet provides many news services that contain what is known as a message board.  This is where there are always discussions on certain topics.  This is a good place to sneak in an ad from time to time as long as it is respectfully done and doesn’t disrupt the conversation.  The best way to do this is by disguising the ad as a perfectly acceptable response to a conversation.  «Go to where the people you want hang out».  Do not get carried away because the promoter of the site can end up with a bad reputation that gives the site a bad reputation for what is called «spamming».  Knowing how to post good messages is a way to promote the we site in itself.  Show ads that interest people and do not use short flashy ads.  Short flashy ads irritate people.  It is bast to use long indirect informal ads that make it seem like a sensible conversation and not an ad.  It is best to only post messages from time to time.\r\n\r\n There are many software programs out there that will do most of this stuff extremely fast and efficient.  The price of the software varies.  The software will do in minutes what the average person could do in hours saving valuable time and effort.  And all the information is saved making it even faster to redo the process again and again.\r\n\r\n There are also promote web sites that are dedicated to promoting other web sites.  It is their specialization and naturally there is a fee.  They offer just mainly the ability to fill out one application and be entered into practically every search engine available to the public.  Some even offer free statistics to see how the web site is progressing.\r\n\r\n Also the more things that are offered on the web site the possibility for more people to visit the site increases dramatically.  It will hook people in and keep them coming back.  A very good example of this is to give away free gifts.  Giving away gifts is the best way to get a web site up and running the way that is desired.  It will bring in visitor and those visitors will recommend others to visit.  It’s a ongoing chain reaction that happens everyday on the web.  Everybody loves the word free regardless of what is free.  It could be something as simple as a download.\r\n\r\n Free information is another way to attract visitors to the wed site.  The more that is offered the more that will come.  It is best to make sure the information is something that others would be interested in.  Look around at news groups and see what information is talked about often and then post some info on the topic on the web site.  Then simply invite people to view the information but do it casually.

        "text":"I am no poet.  I do not love words for the sake of words.  I love words for what they can accomplish.  Similarly, I am no arithmetician.  Numbers that speak only of numbers are of little interest to me.\r\n Due to my abandonment of chemistry and arithmetic, I had a great deal of free time on my hands.  Some of this I spent in the Fishery, making a Bloodless of my own that sold practically before it hit the shelves.  I also spent a fair amount of time in the Archives and the Medica, doing research for an essay titled “On the Non-Efficacy of Arrowroot.”  Arwyl was skeptical, but agreed my initial research warranted attention.\r\n I also spent some of my time romantically.  It was a new experience for me, as I had never caught the eye of women before.  Or if I had, I hadn’t known what to do with the attention.\r\n But I was older now, and wiser to some degree.  And because of the stories circulating, women on both sides of the river were beginning to show an interest in me.\r\n My romances were all pleasant and brief.  I cannot say why brief, except to state the obvious: that I do not have much in me that might encourage a woman to make long habit of my company.  Simmon, for example, had a great deal to offer.  He was a gemstone in the rough.  Not stunning at first glance, but with a great deal of worth beneath the surface.  Sim was tender, kind, and attentive as any woman could care for.  He made Fela deliriously happy.  Sim was a prince.\r\n By contrast, what did I have to offer?  Nothing really.  Less now.  I was more like a curious stone that is picked up, carried a while, and finally dropped again with the realization that for all its interesting look, it is nothing more than hardened earth.\r\n\r\n “Master Kilvin,” I asked.  “Can you think of a metal that will stand hard use for two thousand years and remain relatively unworn or unblemished?”\r\n The huge artificer looked up from the brass gear he was inscribing and eyed me standing in the doorway of his office.  “And what manner of project are you planning now, Re’lar Kvothe?”\r\n In the last three months, I’d been trying to create another schema as successful as my Bloodless.  Partly for the money, but also because I’d learned that Kilvin was much more likely to promote students with three or four impressive schema to their credit.\r\n Unfortunately, I had met with a string of failures here, too.  I’d had more than a dozen clever ideas, none of which had led to a finished design.\r\n Most of the ideas were struck down by Kilvin himself.  Eight of my clever ideas had already been created, some of them more than a hundred years ago.  Five of them, Kilvin informed me, would require the use of runes that were forbidden to Re’lar.  Three of them were mathematically unsound, and he quickly sketched out how they were doomed to failure, saving me dozens of hours of wasted time.\r\n One of my ideas, he rejected as “utterly inappropriate for a responsible artificer.”  I argued that a mechanism that would cut the time needed to reload a ballista would help ships defend against piracy.  It would help defend towns against attack by Vi Sembi raiders. . . .\r\n But Kilvin would hear none of it.  When his face began to grow dark as a storm cloud, I quickly abandoned my carefully planned arguments.\r\n In the end, only two of my ideas were sound, acceptable, and original.  But after weeks of work, I was forced to abandon them as well, unable to get them to work.\r\n Kilvin set down his stylus and half-inscribed brass gear, turning to face me.  “I admire a student who thinks in terms of durability, Re’lar Kvothe.  But a thousand years is a great deal to ask of stone, let alone metal.  To say nothing of metal put to heavy use.”\r\n I was asking about Caesura, of course.  But I hesitated to tell Kilvin the full truth.  I knew all too well that the Master Artificer did not approve of artificery being used in conjunction with any sort of weapon.  While he might appreciate the craftsmanship of such a sword, he would not think well of me for owning such a thing.\r\n I smiled.  “It isn’t for a project,” I said.  “I was just curious.  During my travels I was shown a sword that was quite serviceable and sharp.  Despite this, there seemed to be proof that it was over two thousand years old.  Do you know of any metal that could avoid breaking for so long as that?  Let alone keep an edge?”\r\n “Ah.”  Kilvin nodded, his expression not particularly surprised.  “There are such things.  Old magics, one could say.  Or old arts now lost to us.  These things are scattered through the world.  Marvelous devices.  Mysteries.  There are many reliable sources that speak of the ever-burning lamp.”  He gestured with a broad hand at the hemispheres of glass laid out on his worktable.  “We even possess a handful of these things here at the University.”\r\n I felt my curiosity flare up.  “What sort of things?”  I asked.\r\n Kilvin tugged his beard idly with one hand.  “I have a device devoid of any sygaldry that seems to do nothing but consume angular momentum.  I have four ingots of white metal, lighter than water, that I can neither melt nor mar in any way.  A sheet of black glass, one side of which lacks any frictive properties at all.  A piece of oddly shaped stone that maintains a temperate slightly above freezing, no matter what the heat around it.”  His massive shoulders shrugged.  “These things are mysteries.”\r\n I opened my mouth, then hesitated.  “Would it be inappropriate for me to ask to see some of these things?”\r\n Kilvin’s smile was very white against the dark of his skin and his beard.  “It is never inappropriate to ask, Re’lar Kvothe,” he said.  “A student should be curious.  I would be troubled if you were indifferent to such things.”\r\n The big artificer went to his large wooden desk, so strewn with half-finished projects that the surface was barely visible.  He unlocked a drawer with a key from his pocket and drew out two dull metal cubes, slightly larger than dice.\r\n “Many of these old things we cannot fathom or make use of,” he said.  “But some possess remarkable utility.”  He rattled the two metal cubes as if they were dice, and they rang together sweetly in his hand.  “We call these warding stones.”\r\n He bent and set them on the floor, spaced several feet apart from each other.  He touched them and spoke very softly under his breath, too quietly for me to hear.\r\n I felt a subtle change in the air.  At first I thought that the room was growing colder, but then I realized the truth: I couldn’t feel the radiant heat of the smoldering forge at the other end of Kilvin’s office.\r\n Kilvin casually picked up the bar of iron used to stir the forge and swung it hard at my head.  His gesture was so casual that it caught me completely off my guard, and I didn’t even have time to cower or flinch away.\r\n The bar stopped two feet away from me, as if striking some unseen obstruction.  There was no sound as if it had struck something, neither did it rebound in Kilvin’s grip.\r\n I reached out my hand cautiously and it butted up against . . .  nothing.  It was as if the intangible air in front of me was suddenly made solid.\r\n Kilvin grinned at me.  “The warding stones are of particular use when performing dangerous experiments or testing certain equipment,” he said.  “They somehow produce a thaumic and kinetic barrier.”\r\n I continued to run my hand along the unseen barrier.  It wasn’t hard, or even solid.  It gave way slightly when I pushed at it and felt slippery as buttered glass.\r\n Kilvin watched me, his expression faintly amused.  “Truthfully, Re’lar Kvothe, until Elodin made his suggestion, I was thinking of calling your arrow-arresting device the Minor Ward.”  He frowned slightly.  “Not entirely accurate, of course, but more so than Elodin’s dramatic nonsense.”\r\n I leaned hard against the unseen barrier.  It was solid as a stone wall.  Now that I was looking more closely, I could see a subtle distortion in the air, as if I were looking through a slightly imperfect sheet of glass.  “This is far superior to my arrowcatch, Master Kilvin.”\r\n “True.”  Kilvin gave a conciliatory nod and bent to pick up the stones, muttering again under his breath.  I staggered a little when the barrier disappeared.  “But your cleverness we can repeat endlessly.  This mystery we cannot.”\r\n Kilvin held up the two cubes of metal on the palm of his huge hand.  “These are useful, but never forget: cleverness and caution profit the artificer.  We do our work in the realm of the real.”  He closed his fingers over the warding stones.  “Leave mystery to poets, priests, and fools.”\r\n\r\n Despite my other failures, my study with Master Elodin was progressing rather well.  He claimed all I needed to improve myself as a namer was time and dedication.  I gave him both, and he put them to use in odd ways.\r\n We spent hours riddling.  He made me drink a pint of applejack, then read Teccam’s Theophany from cover to cover.  He made me wear a blindfold for three days straight, which didn’t improve my performance in my other classes, but amused Wil and Sim to no end.\r\n He encouraged me to see how long I could stay awake.  And since I could afford all the coffee I liked, I managed nearly five days.  Though by the end I was rather manic and starting to hear voices.\r\n And there was the incident on the roof of the Archives.  Everyone has heard about that in one version or another, it seems.\r\n There was a great beast of a thunderstorm rolling in, and Elodin decided it would do me good to spend some time in the middle of it.  The closer the better, he said.  He knew Lorren would never allow us access to the roof of the Archives, so Elodin simply stole the key.\r\n Unfortunately, that meant when the key went tumbling off the roof, no one knew we were trapped up there.  As a result the two of us were forced to spend the entire night on the bare stone rooftop, caught in the teeth of the furious storm.\r\n It wasn’t until midmorning that the weather calmed enough for us to call down to the courtyard for help.  Then, as there didn’t seem to be a second key, Lorren took the straightest course and had several burly scrivs simply batter down the door leading to the roof.\r\n None of this would have been a particular problem if, just as it had started to rain, Elodin hadn’t insisted that we strip ourselves naked, wrap our clothes in an oilskin, and weigh them down with a brick.  According to Elodin, it would help me experience the storm to the fullest degree possible.\r\n"

The theme this week is adjectives, so first of all, when it comes to time, are you normally late or are you always punctual?\r\n Matt: Always punctual.\r\n Todd: Always punctual.\r\n Matt: Yeah, I find it very annoying when people are late.  I tend to be punctual.  I follow kind of a pattern of my dad and my grandfather.  My grandfather used to sit in the car for an hour before church, just sitting in the car waiting for the rest of the family to go and my father was the same way, and I used to abhor that type of behavior but actually as I've grown older I found it annoying to be late and when I'm waiting for people and they end up being late, it kind of gets under my skin so I've kind of always followed the punctual route.\r\n Todd: OK.  Thanks.  OK.  OK, now let's move on to money.  Now would you consider yourself to be generous with money and time or stingy?\r\n Matt: Usually stingy, because I have always been single and I've always been generous with people, like that I have loved and, you know, my family but I kind of just basically take care of myself and I've never had expendable income where I've been able to donate and give money to causes.  You know I would love to do that sort of thing but I never have been able to so I've always been careful with my money and I don't take a lot, you know, to live on, and I don't have a lot of vices so.\r\n Todd: OK, cool Matt.  OK, and now let's talk about personality.  Let's say if you go to a party or you're meeting people, would you say that you're outgoing or you're shy?\r\n Matt: Generally I'm out going, depending on the alcohol involved.  I'm actually kind of shy when I first enter a party like most people and I sort of seek out to find that person or that group of people that I know, but yeah, usually I'm fairly outgoing and I like talking to people and meeting new people.\r\n Todd: OK, Matt the last one, we're talking about work or maybe just personal time.  Would you say that you're lazy or that you are hard-working?\r\n Matt: I would say I'm hard-working, mainly at work but I'm very lazy when there is nothing to do, when I have no function in life, when there is nothing going on on the weekends I tend to be very lazy and it's hard to motivate unless I've got like a strict goal that I want to achieve or something I need to do, I tend to putter around and do very little unless I'm forced to."
