So, what do ya think?  Are you gonna stay?  Don't cry anymore Sandy, I'll go get your bags.\r\n\r\n Sandy: I'm not crying, I'm laughing!  I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you’re surrounded by critters that care about ya.  Huh, duh.  What am I doing?  I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.\r\n\r\n SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?\r\n\r\n Sandy: I'm staying! \r\n\r\n SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.\r\n\r\n Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? \r\n\r\n Sandy: What did you just say?!\r\n\r\n Patrick: Should I start running now?

His party, United Russia, has won just under 50% of the vote.\r\n\r\n For Vladimir Putin this is uncharted territory.  He's grown used to being Russia's most popular and powerful politician - completely in control.  But his political party has stuttered at the polls.\r\n\r\n United Russia will remain the largest single party in the new parliament but it will have fewer seats.  Its share of the vote has dropped from 64% to around 50%.  And that amid widespread allegations of vote rigging in favour of the ruling party.\r\n\r\n That will come as an embarrassment to Mr Putin, just three months before he runs again for Russian president.  He's almost certain to win the presidential election next March.\r\n\r\n But the parliamentary poll reflects a growing fatigue with a leader who has dominated the Russian political stage for more than a decade.\r\n\r\n Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow"

        "text":"Martinson, from long experience conceived that this must be a matter of family misconduct—a son, daughter, wife.  Such cases were not infrequent.\r\n\r\n \"I thought I would like to talk to Mr. Pinkerton himself, but if you're the responsible head—\" Butler paused.\r\n\r\n \"I am,\" replied Martinson.  \"You can talk to me with the same freedom that you could to Mr. Pinkerton.  Won't you come into my private office?  We can talk more at ease in there.\"\r\n\r\n He led the way into an adjoining room which had two windows looking down into Broadway;  an oblong table, heavy, brown, smoothly polished;  four leather-backed chairs;  and some pictures of the Civil War battles in which the North had been victorious.  Butler followed doubtfully.  He hated very much to take any one into his confidence in regard to Aileen.  He was not sure that he would, even now.  He wanted to \"look these fellys over,\" as he said in his mind.  He would decide then what he wanted to do.  He went to one of the windows and looked down into the street, where there was a perfect swirl of omnibuses and vehicles of all sorts.  Mr. Martinson quietly closed the door.\r\n\r\n \"Now then, if there's anything I can do for you,\" Mr. Martinson paused.  He thought by this little trick to elicit Buder's real name—it often \"worked\"— but in this instance the name was not forthcoming.  Butler was too shrewd.\r\n\r\n \"I'm not so sure that I want to go into this,\" said the old man solemnly.  \"Certainly not if there's any risk of the thing not being handled in the right way.  There's somethin' I want to find out about—somethin' that I ought to know;  but it's a very private matter with me, and—\" He paused to think and conjecture, looking at Mr. Martinson the while.  The latter understood his peculiar state of mind.  He had seen many such cases.\r\n\r\n \"Let me say right here, to begin with, Mr.—\"\r\n\r\n \"Scanlon,\" interpolated Butler, easily;  \"that's as good a name as any if you want to use one.  I'm keepin' me own to meself for the present.\"\r\n\r\n \"Scanlon,\" continued Martinson, easily.  \"I really don't care whether it's your right name or not.  I was just going to say that it might not be necessary to have your right name under any circumstances— it all depends upon what you want to know.  But, so far as your private affairs are concerned, they are as safe with us, as if you had never told them to any one.  Our business is built upon confidence, and we never betray it.  We wouldn't dare.  We have men and women who have been in our employ for over thirty years, and we never retire any one except for cause, and we don't pick people who are likely to need to be retired for cause.  Mr. Pinkerton is a good judge of men.  There are others here who consider that they are.  We handle over ten thousand separate cases in all parts of the United States every year.  We work on a case only so long as we are wanted.  We try to find out only such things as our customers want.  We do not pry unnecessarily into anybody's affairs.  If we decide that we cannot find out what you want to know, we are the first to say so.  Many cases are rejected right here in this office before we ever begin.  Yours might be such a one.  We don't want cases merely for the sake of having them, and we are frank to say so.  Some matters that involve public policy, or some form of small persecution, we don't touch at all—we won't be a party to them.  You can see how that is.  You look to me to be a man of the world.  I hope I am one.  Does it strike you that an organization like ours would be likely to betray any one's confidence?\"  He paused and looked at Butler for confirmation of what he had just said.\r\n\r\n \"It wouldn't seem likely,\" said the latter;  \"that's the truth.  It's not aisy to bring your private affairs into the light of day, though,\" added the old man, sadly.\r\n\r\n They both rested.\r\n\r\n \"Well,\" said Butler, finally, \"you look to me to be all right, and I'd like some advice.  Mind ye, I'm willing to pay for it well enough;  and it isn't anything that'll be very hard to find out.  I want to know whether a certain man where I live is goin' with a certain woman, and where.  You could find that out aisy enough, I belave—couldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Nothing easier,\" replied Martinson.  \"We are doing it all the time.  Let me see if I can help you just a moment, Mr. Scanlon, in order to make it easier for you.  It is very plain to me that you don't care to tell any more than you can help, and we don't care to have you tell any more than we absolutely need.  We will have to have the name of the city, of course, and the name of either the man or the woman;  but not necessarily both of them, unless you want to help us in that way.  Sometimes if you give us the name of one party—say the man, for illustration—and the description of the woman—an accurate one—or a photograph, we can tell you after a little while exactly what you want to know.  Of course, it's always better if we have full information.  You suit yourself about that.  Tell me as much or as little as you please, and I'll guarantee that we will do our best to serve you, and that you will be satisfied afterward.\"\r\n\r\n He smiled genially.\r\n\r\n \"Well, that bein' the case,\" said Butler, finally taking the leap, with many mental reservations, however, \"I'll be plain with you.  My name's not Scanlon.  It's Butler.  I live in Philadelphy.  There's a man there, a banker by the name of Cowperwood—Frank A. Cowperwood—\"\r\n\r\n \"Wait a moment,\" said Martinson, drawing an ample pad out of his pocket and producing a lead-pencil;  \"I want to get that.  How do you spell it?\"\r\n\r\n Butler told him.\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  now go on.\"\r\n\r\n \"He has a place in Third Street—Frank A. Cowperwood—any one can show you where it is.  He's just failed there recently.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, that's the man,\" interpolated Martinson.  \"I've heard of him.  He's mixed up in some city embezzlement case over there.  I suppose the reason you didn't go to our Philadelphia office is because you didn't want our local men over there to know anything about it.  Isn't that it?\"\r\n\r\n \"That's the man, and that's the reason,\" said Butler.  \"I don't care to have anything of this known in Philadelphy.  That's why I'm here.  This man has a house on Girard Avenue—Nineteen-thirty-seven.  You can find that out, too, when you get over there.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" agreed Mr. Martinson.\r\n\r\n \"Well, it's him that I want to know about—him—and a certain woman, or girl, rather.\"  The old man paused and winced at this necessity of introducing Aileen into the case.  He could scarcely think of it—he was so fond of her.  He had been so proud of Aileen.  A dark, smoldering rage burned in his heart against Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n \"A relative of yours—possibly, I suppose,\" remarked Martinson, tactfully.  \"You needn't tell me any more—just give me a description if you wish.  We may be able to work from that.\"  He saw quite clearly what a fine old citizen in his way he was dealing with here, and also that the man was greatly troubled.  Butler's heavy, meditative face showed it.  \"You can be quite frank with me, Mr. Butler,\" he added;  \"I think I understand.  We only want such information as we must have to help you, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said the old man, dourly.  \"She is a relative.  She's me daughter, in fact.  You look to me like a sensible, honest man.  I'm her father, and I wouldn't do anything for the world to harm her.  It's tryin' to save her I am.  It's him I want.\"  He suddenly closed one big fist forcefully.\r\n\r\n Martinson, who had two daughters of his own, observed the suggestive movement.\r\n\r\n \"I understand how you feel, Mr. Butler,\" he observed.  \"I am a father myself.  We'll do all we can for you.  If you can give me an accurate description of her, or let one of my men see her at your house or office, accidentally, of course, I think we can tell you in no time at all if they are meeting with any regularity.  That's all you want to know, is it—just that?\"\r\n\r\n \"That's all,\" said Butler, solemnly.\r\n\r\n \"Well, that oughtn't to take any time at all, Mr. Butler—three or four days possibly, if we have any luck—a week, ten days, two weeks.  It depends on how long you want us to shadow him in case there is no evidence the first few days.\"\r\n\r\n \"I want to know, however long it takes,\" replied Butler, bitterly.  \"I want to know, if it takes a month or two months or three to find out.  I want to know.\"  The old man got up as he said this, very positive, very rugged.  \"And don't send me men that haven't sinse— lots of it, plase.  I want men that are fathers, if you've got 'em—and that have sinse enough to hold their tongues—not b'ys.\"\r\n\r\n \"I understand, Mr. Butler,\" Martinson replied.  \"Depend on it, you'll have the best we have, and you can trust them.  They'll be discreet.  You can depend on that.  The way I'll do will be to assign just one man to the case at first, some one you can see for yourself whether you like or not.  I'll not tell him anything.  You can talk to him.  If you like him, tell him, and he'll do the rest.  Then, if he needs any more help, he can get it.  What is your address?\"\r\n\r\n Butler gave it to him.\r\n\r\n \"And there'll be no talk about this?\"\r\n\r\n \"None whatever—I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n \"And when'll he be comin' along?\"\r\n\r\n \"To-morrow, if you wish.  I have a man I could send to-night.  He isn't here now or I'd have him talk with you.  I'll talk to him, though, and make everything clear.  You needn't worry about anything.  Your daughter's reputation will be safe in his hands.\"\r\n\r\n \"Thank you kindly,\" commented Butler, softening the least bit in a gingerly way.  \"I'm much obliged to you.  I'll take it as a great favor, and pay you well.\"\r\n\r\n \"Never mind about that, Mr. Butler,\" replied Martinson.  \"You're welcome to anything this concern can do for you at its ordinary rates.\"\r\n\r\n He showed Butler to the door, and the old man went out.  He was feeling very depressed over this—very shabby.  To think he should have to put detectives on the track of his Aileen, his daughter! \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXVI\r\n\r\n The very next day there called at Butler's office a long, preternaturally solemn man of noticeable height and angularity, dark-haired, dark-eyed, sallow, with a face that was long and leathery, and particularly hawk-like, who talked with Butler for over an hour and then departed.  That evening he came to the Butler house around dinner-time, and, being shown into Butler's room, was given a look at Aileen by a ruse.  Butler sent for her, standing in the doorway just far enough to one side to yield a good view of her.  The detective stood behind one of the heavy curtains which had already been put up for the winter, pretending to look out into the street.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":" Aileen, the moment the door closed, had begun to put on her clothes swiftly and nervously.  Her mind was working like a rapidly moving machine.  She was wondering whether this really could be her father.  Perhaps it was not.  Might there be some other Mrs. Montague—a real one?  Supposing it was her father—he had been so nice to her in not telling the family, in keeping her secret thus far.  He loved her—she knew that.  It makes all the difference in the world in a child's attitude on an occasion like this whether she has been loved and petted and spoiled, or the reverse.  Aileen had been loved and petted and spoiled.  She could not think of her father doing anything terrible physically to her or to any one else.  But it was so hard to confront him—to look into his eyes.  When she had attained a proper memory of him, her fluttering wits told her what to do.\r\n\r\n \"No, Frank,\" she whispered, excitedly;  \"if it's father, you'd better let me go.  I know how to talk to him.  He won't say anything to me.  You stay here.  I'm not afraid—really, I'm not.  If I want you, I'll call you.\"\r\n\r\n He had come over and taken her pretty chin in his hands, and was looking solemnly into her eyes.\r\n\r\n \"You mustn't be afraid,\" he said.  \"I'll go down.  If it's your father, you can go away with him.  I don't think he'll do anything either to you or to me.  If it is he, write me something at the office.  I'll be there.  If I can help you in any way, I will.  We can fix up something.  There's no use trying to explain this.  Say nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n He had on his coat and overcoat, and was standing with his hat in his hand.  Aileen was nearly dressed, struggling with the row of red current-colored buttons which fastened her dress in the back.  Cowperwood helped her.  When she was ready—hat, gloves, and all— he said:\r\n\r\n \"Now let me go first.  I want to see.\"\r\n\r\n \"No;  please, Frank,\" she begged, courageously.  \"Let me, I know it's father.  Who else could it be?\"  She wondered at the moment whether her father had brought her two brothers but would not now believe it.  He would not do that, she knew.  \"You can come if I call.\"  She went on.  \"Nothing's going to happen, though.  I understand him.  He won't do anything to me.  If you go it will only make him angry.  Let me go.  You stand in the door here.  If I don't call, it's all right.  Will you?\"\r\n\r\n She put her two pretty hands on his shoulders, and he weighed the matter very carefully.  \"Very well,\" he said, \"only I'll go to the foot of the stairs with you.\"\r\n\r\n They went to the door and he opened it.  Outside were Alderson with two other detectives and Mrs. Davis, standing perhaps five feet away.\r\n\r\n \"Well,\" said Cowperwood, commandingly, looking at Alderson.\r\n\r\n \"There's a gentleman down-stairs wishes to see the lady,\" said Alderson.  \"It's her father, I think,\" he added quietly.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood made way for Aileen, who swept by, furious at the presence of men and this exposure.  Her courage had entirely returned.  She was angry now to think her father would make a public spectacle of her.  Cowperwood started to follow.\r\n\r\n \"I'd advise you not to go down there right away,\" cautioned Alderson, sagely.  \"That's her father.  Butler's her name, isn't it?  He don't want you so much as he wants her.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood nevertheless walked slowly toward the head of the stairs, listening.\r\n\r\n \"What made you come here, father?\"  he heard Aileen ask.\r\n\r\n Butler's reply he could not hear, but he was now at ease for he knew how much Butler loved his daughter.\r\n\r\n Confronted by her father, Aileen was now attempting to stare defiantly, to look reproachful, but Butler's deep gray eyes beneath their shaggy brows revealed such a weight of weariness and despair as even she, in her anger and defiance, could not openly flaunt.  It was all too sad.\r\n\r\n \"I never expected to find you in a place like this, daughter,\" he said.  \"I should have thought you would have thought better of yourself.\"  His voice choked and he stopped.\r\n\r\n \"I know who you're here with,\" he continued, shaking his head sadly.  \"The dog!  I'll get him yet.  I've had men watchin' you all the time.  Oh, the shame of this day!  The shame of this day!  You'll be comin' home with me now.\"\r\n\r\n \"That's just it, father,\" began Aileen.  \"You've had men watching me.  I should have thought—\" She stopped, because he put up his hand in a strange, agonized, and yet dominating way.\r\n\r\n \"None of that!  none of that!\"  he said, glowering under his strange, sad, gray brows.  \"I can't stand it!  Don't tempt me!  We're not out of this place yet.  He's not!  You'll come home with me now.\"\r\n\r\n Aileen understood.  It was Cowperwood he was referring to.  That frightened her.\r\n\r\n \"I'm ready,\" she replied, nervously.\r\n\r\n The old man led the way broken-heartedly.  He felt he would never live to forget the agony of this hour. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXVII\r\n\r\n In spite of Butler's rage and his determination to do many things to the financier, if he could, he was so wrought up and shocked by the attitude of Aileen that he could scarcely believe he was the same man he had been twenty-four hours before.  She was so nonchalant, so defiant.  He had expected to see her wilt completely when confronted with her guilt.  Instead, he found, to his despair, after they were once safely out of the house, that he had aroused a fighting quality in the girl which was not incomparable to his own.  She had some of his own and Owen's grit.  She sat beside him in the little runabout—not his own—in which he was driving her home, her face coloring and blanching by turns, as different waves of thought swept over her, determined to stand her ground now that her father had so plainly trapped her, to declare for Cowperwood and her love and her position in general.  What did she care, she asked herself, what her father thought now?  She was in this thing.  She loved Cowperwood;  she was permanently disgraced in her father's eyes.  What difference could it all make now?  He had fallen so low in his parental feeling as to spy on her and expose her before other men—strangers, detectives, Cowperwood.  What real affection could she have for him after this?  He had made a mistake, according to her.  He had done a foolish and a contemptible thing, which was not warranted however bad her actions might have been.  What could he hope to accomplish by rushing in on her in this way and ripping the veil from her very soul before these other men—these crude detectives?  Oh, the agony of that walk from the bedroom to the reception-room!  She would never forgive her father for this—never, never, never!  He had now killed her love for him—that was what she felt.  It was to be a battle royal between them from now on.  As they rode—in complete silence for a while—her hands clasped and unclasped defiantly, her nails cutting her palms, and her mouth hardened.\r\n\r\n It is an open question whether raw opposition ever accomplishes anything of value in this world.  It seems so inherent in this mortal scheme of things that it appears to have a vast validity.  It is more than likely that we owe this spectacle called life to it, and that this can be demonstrated scientifically;  but when that is said and done, what is the value?  What is the value of the spectacle?  And what the value of a scene such as this enacted between Aileen and her father?\r\n\r\n The old man saw nothing for it, as they rode on, save a grim contest between them which could end in what?  What could he do with her?  They were riding away fresh from this awful catastrophe, and she was not saying a word!  She had even asked him why he had come there!  How was he to subdue her, when the very act of trapping her had failed to do so?  His ruse, while so successful materially, had failed so utterly spiritually.  They reached the house, and Aileen got out.  The old man, too nonplussed to wish to go further at this time, drove back to his office.  He then went out and walked—a peculiar thing for him to do;  he had done nothing like that in years and years—walking to think.  Coming to an open Catholic church, he went in and prayed for enlightenment, the growing dusk of the interior, the single everlasting lamp before the repository of the chalice, and the high, white altar set with candles soothing his troubled feelings.\r\n\r\n He came out of the church after a time and returned home.  Aileen did not appear at dinner, and he could not eat.  He went into his private room and shut the door—thinking, thinking, thinking.  The dreadful spectacle of Aileen in a house of ill repute burned in his brain.  To think that Cowperwood should have taken her to such a place—his Aileen, his and his wife's pet.  In spite of his prayers, his uncertainty, her opposition, the puzzling nature of the situation, she must be got out of this.  She must go away for a while, give the man up, and then the law should run its course with him.  In all likelihood Cowperwood would go to the penitentiary— if ever a man richly deserved to go, it was he.  Butler would see that no stone was left unturned.  He would make it a personal issue, if necessary.  All he had to do was to let it be known in judicial circles that he wanted it so.  He could not suborn a jury, that would be criminal;  but he could see that the case was properly and forcefully presented;  and if Cowperwood were convicted, Heaven help him.  The appeal of his financial friends would not save him.  The judges of the lower and superior courts knew on which side their bread was buttered.  They would strain a point in favor of the highest political opinion of the day, and he certainly could influence that.  Aileen meanwhile was contemplating the peculiar nature of her situation.  In spite of their silence on the way home, she knew that a conversation was coming with her father.  It had to be.  He would want her to go somewhere.  Most likely he would revive the European trip in some form—she now suspected the invitation of Mrs. Mollenhauer as a trick;  and she had to decide whether she would go.  Would she leave Cowperwood just when he was about to be tried?  She was determined she would not.  She wanted to see what was going to happen to him.  She would leave home first—run to some relative, some friend, some stranger, if necessary, and ask to be taken in.  She had some money—a little.  Her father had always been very liberal with her.  She could take a few clothes and disappear.  They would be glad enough to send for her after she had been gone awhile.  Her mother would be frantic;  Norah and Callum and Owen would be beside themselves with wonder and worry;  her father—she could see him.  Maybe that would bring him to his senses.  In spite of all her emotional vagaries, she was the pride and interest of this home, and she knew it.\r\n\r\n It was in this direction that her mind was running when her father, a few days after the dreadful exposure in the Sixth Street house, sent for her to come to him in his room.  He had come home from his office very early in the afternoon, hoping to find Aileen there, in order that he might have a private interview with her, and by good luck found her in.  She had had no desire to go out into the world these last few days—she was too expectant of trouble to come.  She had just written Cowperwood asking for a rendezvous out on the Wissahickon the following afternoon, in spite of the detectives.  She must see him.  Her father, she said, had done nothing;  but she was sure he would attempt to do something.  She wanted to talk to Cowperwood about that.\r\n\r\n \"I've been thinkin' about ye, Aileen, and what ought to be done in this case,\" began her father without preliminaries of any kind once they were in his \"office room\" in the house together.  \"You're on the road to ruin if any one ever was.  I tremble when I think of your immortal soul.  I want to do somethin' for ye, my child, before it's too late.  I've been reproachin' myself for the last month and more, thinkin', perhaps, it was somethin' I had done, or maybe had failed to do, aither me or your mother, that has brought ye to the place where ye are to-day.  Needless to say, it's on me conscience, me child.  It's a heartbroken man you're lookin' at this day.  I'll never be able to hold me head up again.  Oh, the shame—the shame!  That I should have lived to see it!\"\r\n\r\n \"But father,\" protested Aileen, who was a little distraught at the thought of having to listen to a long preachment which would relate to her duty to God and the Church and her family and her mother and him.  She realized that all these were important in their way;  but Cowperwood and his point of view had given her another outlook on life.  They had discussed this matter of families—parents, children, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters— from almost every point of view.  Cowperwood's laissez-faire attitude had permeated and colored her mind completely.  She saw things through his cold, direct \"I satisfy myself\" attitude.  He was sorry for all the little differences of personality that sprang up between people, causing quarrels, bickerings, oppositions, and separation;  but they could not be helped.  People outgrew each other.  Their points of view altered at varying ratios—hence changes.  Morals—those who had them had them;  those who hadn't, hadn't.  There was no explaining.  As for him, he saw nothing wrong in the sex relationship.  Between those who were mutually compatible it was innocent and delicious.  Aileen in his arms, unmarried, but loved by him, and he by her, was as good and pure as any living woman—a great deal purer than most.  One found oneself in a given social order, theory, or scheme of things.  For purposes of social success, in order not to offend, to smooth one's path, make things easy, avoid useless criticism, and the like, it was necessary to create an outward seeming—ostensibly conform.  Beyond that it was not necessary to do anything.  Never fail, never get caught.  If you did, fight your way out silently and say nothing.  That was what he was doing in connection with his present financial troubles;  that was what he had been ready to do the other day when they were caught.  It was something of all this that was coloring Aileen's mood as she listened at present.\r\n\r\n \"But father,\" she protested, \"I love Mr. Cowperwood.  It's almost the same as if I were married to him.  He will marry me some day when he gets a divorce from Mrs. Cowperwood.  You don't understand how it is.  He's very fond of me, and I love him.  He needs me.\"\r\n\r\n Butler looked at her with strange, non-understanding eyes.  \"Divorce, did you say,\" he began, thinking of the Catholic Church and its dogma in regard to that.  \"He'll divorce his own wife and children— and for you, will he?  He needs you, does he?\"  he added, sarcastically.  \"What about his wife and children?  I don't suppose they need him, do they?  What talk have ye?\"\r\n\r\n Aileen flung her head back defiantly.  \"It's true, nevertheless,\" she reiterated.  \"You just don't understand.\"\r\n\r\n Butler could scarcely believe his ears.  He had never heard such talk before in his life from any one.  It amazed and shocked him.  He was quite aware of all the subtleties of politics and business, but these of romance were too much for him.  He knew nothing about them.  To think a daughter of his should be talking like this, and she a Catholic!  He could not understand where she got such notions unless it was from the Machiavellian, corrupting brain of Cowperwood himself.\r\n\r\n \"How long have ye had these notions, my child?\"  he suddenly asked, calmly and soberly.  \"Where did ye get them?  Ye certainly never heard anything like that in this house, I warrant.  Ye talk as though ye had gone out of yer mind.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, don't talk nonsense, father,\" flared Aileen, angrily, thinking how hopeless it was to talk to her father about such things anyhow.  \"I'm not a child any more.  I'm twenty-four years of age.  You just don't understand.  Mr. Cowperwood doesn't like his wife.  He's going to get a divorce when he can, and will marry me.  I love him, and he loves me, and that's all there is to it.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is it, though?\"  asked Butler, grimly determined by hook or by crook, to bring this girl to her senses.  \"Ye'll be takin' no thought of his wife and children then?  The fact that he's goin' to jail, besides, is nawthin' to ye, I suppose.  Ye'd love him just as much in convict stripes, I suppose—more, maybe.\"  (The old man was at his best, humanly speaking, when he was a little sarcastic.)  \"Ye'll have him that way, likely, if at all.\"\r\n\r\n Aileen blazed at once to a furious heat.  \"Yes, I know,\" she sneered.  \"That's what you would like.  I know what you've been doing.  Frank does, too.  You're trying to railroad him to prison for something he didn't do—and all on account of me.  Oh, I know.  But you won't hurt him.  You can't!  He's bigger and finer than you think he is and you won't hurt him in the long run.  He'll get out again.  You want to punish him on my account;  but he doesn't care.  I'll marry him anyhow.  I love him, and I'll wait for him and marry him, and you can do what you please.  So there!\"\r\n\r\n \"Ye'll marry him, will you?\"  asked Butler, nonplussed and further astounded.  \"So ye'll wait for him and marry him?  Ye'll take him away from his wife and children, where, if he were half a man, he'd be stayin' this minute instead of gallivantin' around with you.  And marry him?  Ye'd disgrace your father and yer mother and yer family?  Ye'll stand here and say this to me, I that have raised ye, cared for ye, and made somethin' of ye?  Where would you be if it weren't for me and your poor, hard-workin' mother, schemin' and plannin' for you year in and year out? "

        "text":"Forecast #1:\r\nLearning will become more social and game-based, and online social gaming may soon replace textbooks in schools.  The idea that students learn more when they are engaged   —   as they are when playing games   —   is helping educators embrace new technologies in the classroom.  In addition to encouraging collaborations, games also allow students to learn from their mistakes with less fear of failing.\r\n\r\n Forecast #2:\r\nCommercial space tourism will grow significantly during the coming decade.  By 2021, there will be 13,000 suborbital passengers annually, resulting in $650 million in revenue.  Many companies are currently working to make commercial space flight a viable industry, according to Melchor Antuñano, director of the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.\r\n\r\n Forecast #3:\r\nNanotechnology offers hope for restoring eyesight.  Flower-shaped electrodes topped with photodiodes, implanted in blind patients’ eyes, may restore their sight.  The “nanoflowers” mimic the geometry of neurons, making them a better medium than traditional computer chips for carrying photodiodes and transmitting the collected light signals to the brain.\r\n\r\n Forecast #4:\r\nRobotic earthworms will gobble up our garbage.  Much of what we throw away still has value.  Metals, petroleum, and other components could get additional use if we extracted them, and robotic earthworms could do that for us.  The tiny, agile robot teams will go through mines and landfills to extract anything of value, and then digest the remaining heaps into quality top soil.\r\n\r\n Forecast #5:\r\nThe dust bowls of the twenty-first century will dwarf those seen in the twentieth.  Two giant dust bowls are now forming, in Asia and in Africa, due to massive amounts of soil erosion and desertification resulting from overgrazing, over-plowing, and deforestation, warns environmental futurist Lester R. Brown.\r\n\r\n Forecast #6:\r\nLunar-based solar power production may be the best way to meet future energy demands.  Solar power can be more dependably and inexpensively gathered on the Moon than on Earth.  This clean energy source is capable of delivering the 20 trillion watts of power a year that the Earth’s predicted 10 billion people will require by mid-century.\r\n\r\n Forecast #7:\r\nMachine vision will become available in the next 5 to 15 years, with visual range ultimately exceeding that of the human eye.  This technology will greatly enhance robotic systems’ capabilities.\r\n\r\n Forecast #8:\r\nAdvances in fuel cells will enable deep-sea habitation.  Fuel cells such as those currently being developed for automobiles will produce electricity directly, with no toxic fumes.  This advance will eventually make it easier to explore and even colonize the undersea world via extended submarine journeys.\r\n\r\n Forecast #9:\r\nFuture buildings may be more responsive to weather fluctuations.  “Protocell cladding” that utilizes bioluminescent bacteria or other materials would be applied on building facades to collect water and sunlight, helping to cool the interiors and produce biofuels.  The protocells are made from oil droplets in water, which allow soluble chemicals to be exchanged between the drops and their surroundings.\r\n\r\n Forecast #10:\r\nThe end of identity as we know it?  It may become very easy to create a new identity (or many identities) for ourselves.  All we will have to do is create new avatars in virtual reality.  Those avatars will act on our behalf in real life to conduct such high-level tasks as performing intensive research, posting blog entries and Facebook updates, and managing businesses.  The lines between ourselves and our virtual other selves will blur, to the point where most of us will, in essence, have multiple personalities.\r\n\r\n THE FUTURIST Magazine"

        "text":" NEWARK COUNTY SEWAGE PROCESSING PLANT\r\n (The foreman is taking Mulder on a grand tour of the facility.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: City runs on several different systems... some new, some built around the turn of the century.  Almost as old as Charlie here.\r\n\r\n (He points to an older man walking by, wearing a hard-hat, writing something down on a clipboard.)\r\n\r\n Isn't that right, Charlie?\r\n\r\n CHARLIE: Oh, yes, sir.\r\n\r\n (Charlie keeps walking, as does Mulder and the foreman.  They walk over to an encased map.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: What part of the sewer was I in?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: That'd be one of the older sections, big eight-foot tunnels.\r\n\r\n MULDER: They look more like a catacomb than a sewer line.\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Yup, all the new sections are concrete pipe, not much of it bigger than twenty-four inches.\r\n\r\n MULDER: And all the sewage comes through this plant?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Five-hundred-and-sixty thousand people a day call my office on the porcelain telephone.\r\n\r\n (Mulder smiles and pulls out the encased flukeworm.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Have you ever seen one of these?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Looks like a big, old worm.\r\n\r\n MULDER: It's called a fluke.  It came from the body they pulled out of the sewer.\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Wouldn't surprise me.  No telling what's been breeding down there in the last hundred years.\r\n\r\n (Downstairs, the water is loud as it rumbles through as Charlie stands on a plank, smoking a cigarette.  He hears a rumbling in the water underneath him and sees something swim beneath him.  Charlie runs over to a pole with a built-in telephone.  Upstairs, the foreman picks up the phone, which has a bright red light flashing.)\r\n\r\n Ray here.\r\n\r\n (Some talking can be heard.)\r\n\r\n Yeah.  Charlie, slow down.\r\n\r\n (Mulder looks over.  Downstairs, they run over to Charlie, who is standing at a system control.)\r\n\r\n CHARLIE: I'm backflushing the system.  It's in there.\r\n\r\n MULDER: What is it?\r\n\r\n CHARLIE: I don't know.  It just swam right past me.\r\n\r\n (He flips a switch.)\r\n\r\n There it is.\r\n\r\n (They walk over to a yellow-tube pipe.  Charlie shines a flashlight on the thing's face.  It's the Flukeman, a giant flukeworm that has human qualities.  The scolex is highly evident.  Ray and Mulder look at each other, then back at the monster.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 12 \r\n FBI HEADQUARTERS;  WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n (Scully is reading a report on flatworms on her computer.  She speaks over the scene as she writes her findings down.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: The turbellarian flatworms are free-living carnivorous scavengers, usually less than three centimeters in length, found in fresh and sea water.  They are hermaphroditic with complex reproductive systems, capable of internal fertilization.  Many species require more than one host to complete a life cycle.  Although the shape of the wound on the sanitation worker suggest scolex attachment, the sheer size of the wound precludes involvement of the common flukeworm.\r\n\r\n (She hears a rustling and looks to her door to see a tabloid magazine being slid under.  Taking off her glasses, she walks over and picks it up.  She opens her door and looks outside, but no one is around.  Walking back inside, she flips through the tabloid at her desk.  After looking through the usual nonsense, she finds a mysterious article with the headline \"MONSTER ON BOARD!?\"  Under it, it reads \"Bizarre accident on Russian cargo ship has officials suspicious.\"  There is a picture of the ship.  Scully looks up in realization, then turns to her computer.  She calls up the pathology report and zooms in on the arm a few times.  There is the tattoo.  Her phone rings and she answers it slowly.)\r\n\r\n Scully.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Scully, it's me.  You know that fluke you caught?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Yeah.\r\n\r\n MULDER: It must have been the runt of the litter.\r\n\r\n (Scully is rightfully confused.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 13 \r\n MIDDLESEX COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL\r\n (Scully is looking through the window on the door into a small room, possibly a washroom, with a sink and various pipes in the corner.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: I don't see it.\r\n\r\n (Mulder looks through and points.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: There it is.  Tucked away in the far corner, behind the pipes.\r\n\r\n (Scully sees a large white object move behind the pipes.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Oh my God.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I don't know if you can see it from here, but it has no sex organs.  It's genderless.\r\n\r\n (The Flukeman glares at them from behind the pipes.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Platyhelminthis are often hermaphroditic.  Mulder, this is amazing.  It's vestigial features appear to be parasitic, but it has primate physiology.\r\n\r\n (Mulder nods.)\r\n\r\n Where the hell did it come from?\r\n\r\n MULDER: I don't know, but it looks like I'm going to have to tell Skinner that his suspect is a giant, blood-sucking worm after all.\r\n\r\n (The Flukeman's head moves into the light.)\r\n\r\n The only thing we're missing is the identity of the body in the sewer.\r\n\r\n (They move away from the window.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: He was a Russian.  An engineer on a cargo freighter.  He had a tattoo on his forearm.\r\n\r\n (She hands him a print-out of the close-up of his arm.)\r\n\r\n I didn't make the connection until I detected that that was the name \"Dmitri\" spelled in Cyrillic lettering.\r\n\r\n MULDER: How did you make the connection at all?\r\n\r\n (She hands him the tabloid, folded open to the article.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Somebody shoved this under my door.  I guess you really do have a friend in the F.B.I.  And, Mulder... when you see Skinner to hand in your field report, I know that it's your decision, but I hope that you know that I'd consider it more than a professional loss if you decided to leave.\r\n\r\n (He smiles slightly, hands back the tabloid and print-out, then looks in at the angry Flukeman.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 14 \r\n FBI HEADQUARTERS;  WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n (Skinner is flipping through Mulder's field report slowly, reading it carefully.  Mulder sits across from him, waiting.  Skinner scratches his neck a bit as he reads.  Skinner finishes reading.)\r\n\r\n SKINNER: Everything looks in order.\r\n\r\n (Mulder chuckles.)\r\n\r\n Is something wrong, Agent Mulder?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Well, that's just an unexpected response, considering the bizarre nature of the case... and of the suspect.\r\n\r\n SKINNER: The strangeness of the criminal and the crime are not lost on me.  I had my reaction to them this morning in my conversation with the federal prosecutor's office about how to process the suspect.  This meeting... is to evaluate your work.\r\n\r\n (Mulder sighs slightly.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: There's no way you'll prosecute this.\r\n\r\n SKINNER: The justice department has asked that the suspect be transferred to an institution for a full psychiatric evaluation.\r\n\r\n (Mulder shakes his head.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: This is not a man.  It's a monster.  You can't put it in an institution.\r\n\r\n SKINNER: Then what do you do with it, Agent Mulder, put it in a zoo?  It killed two people.\r\n\r\n (Mulder leans back.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Two?\r\n\r\n SKINNER: The sanitation worker who was attacked was found dead in his home as a result of his injuries.\r\n\r\n (He flips through the file.  Mulder stands to leave, but turns around and points at Skinner angrily.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: You know, you had a pair of agents that could have handled a case like this.  Agent Scully and I might have been able to save that man's life, but you shut us down.\r\n\r\n SKINNER: I know.  This should have been an X-File.\r\n\r\n (Mulder searches for something to say.  Skinner sighs.)\r\n\r\n We all take our orders from someone, Agent Mulder.  That'll be all.\r\n\r\n (Mulder, looking disgusted, leaves.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 15 \r\n MIDDLESEX COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL\r\n (Two workers wheel the Flukeman, strapped down, down a hall and into the Federal Marshall's ambulance truck.  They close the door and one of them pats on the door.)\r\n\r\n MAN: It's secure.\r\n\r\n (The marhsall pulls out.  The transmissions from the intercom can be heard blaring.  The host struggles against his bonds.)\r\n\r\n WOMAN: Charlie twenty-one, Charlie twenty-one, what's your E.T.A.?\r\n\r\n (A mumbling response can be heard.)\r\n\r\n Unit twenty, no further assist needed.  They have the suspect in custody from the, uh...\r\n\r\n (The driver looks back and sees that his passenger is gone.)\r\n\r\n FEDERAL MARSHALL: This is vehicle forty-nine forty, requesting immediate back-up and assistance.\r\n\r\n WOMAN: Roger forty-nine forty, roger forty-nine forty.\r\n\r\n (The Marshall pulls over at the side of the road near a small park office.  He takes his shotgun, pumps it, and walks out of the car slowly.  Moving around to the back, he swings open the door, but there is no sight of his former hostage.  He steps into the car and looks down at the straps, covered in residue.  He wipes the goo off when he hears some hoarse breathing.  The man's screams are heard far off.  A shotgun blast goes off and he screams more.  Hovering over the ambulance is a sign that reads:\r\n\r\n\"LAKE BETTY;  NATURE'S PLAYGROUND \r\n CAMPSITES AVAILABLE \r\n LIVE BAIT \r\n FISH... ALL YEAR ROUND!\"\r\n\r\n The words \"Live Bait\" are a neon sign, glowing.  The Flukeman makes his way across the woods, crawling on the ground towards some portable toilets.  He crawls into the second one and slithers down the bowl, where he sits, waiting for his next possible victim.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 16 \r\n LAKE BETTY PARK;  5:27 am\r\n (A truck backs up to the portable toilet.  It's a tank cleaner service, and the worker gets out of the driver's seat and heads around back.  He puts on rubber gloves and opens the door to the second portable toilet, then takes out a hose and fits it into the toilet.  Flipping a lever, he stands back, smoking a cigarette, as the tube begins to suck out the waste.  But the motor start to sputter as the engine strains to pull up something, obviously the Flukeman.  The man checks the hose, making sure it works, and slowly the blocking object is sucked up the tube into the truck.  The cleaning continues as normal.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 17 \r\n LAKE BETTY PARK;  6:37 am\r\n (Police cars and coroners have enveloped the last murder scene.  The workers are also inspecting the ambulance.  Mulder pulls up as the tank cleaner service truck rolls by.  He walks up to Detective Norman.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: What do you got?\r\n\r\n NORMAN: Well, we got a dead Marshall and an escaped prisoner.  Other than that, we got bubkis.  We got a police line in a two-mile radius.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Watch all the storm drains, any access to the sewer system.  It's going to try to get back underground.\r\n\r\n (His cellular phone rings.  He answers it.)\r\n\r\n Mulder.\r\n\r\n (Cut to an unknown location.  It's Mulder's mysterious contact.)\r\n\r\n X: Mister Mulder, I will make this brief.\r\n\r\n (Cut to Mulder.  Norman talks to some of the other men.)\r\n\r\n Success in your current assignment is imperative.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Who am I speaking to?\r\n\r\n X: Are you hearing me, Mister Mulder?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Yes.  Why is it imperative?\r\n\r\n (Cut to the newfound informant.)\r\n\r\n X: Reinstatement of the X-Files must be undeniable.\r\n\r\n (He hangs up.  Cut to Mulder, who hangs up.  A police officer calls Norman on the walkie-talkie.)\r\n\r\n MAN: K-nine, unit six-four, copy?\r\n\r\n NORMAN: Six-four, copy.\r\n\r\n MAN: Yeah, we're at a campsite approximately a quarter-mile from your position.\r\n\r\n (Mulder walks over.)\r\n\r\n Dogs tracked a scent to a chemical toilet here.  Thought he might be hiding inside, but it's empty.\r\n\r\n MULDER: The tanker.\r\n\r\n NORMAN: Hold on, six-four.\r\n\r\n (He looks at Mulder.)\r\n\r\n What?\r\n\r\n MULDER: What if he's on the tanker truck?\r\n\r\n (He runs to his vehicle.  Norman looks pretty dumbfounded.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 18 \r\n NEWARK COUNTY;  SEWAGE PROCESSING PLANT;  8:15 am\r\n (Another tanker truck rolls down the road as Mulder hurriedly pulls up, unbuckles his seatbelt, and runs in the building.  Later, he and the foreman are walking down a flight of stairs over the yard where the tanker trucks unload.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Company that owns the truck you're looking for doesn't keep detailed service records.  They had about five trucks out in that area this morning.\r\n\r\n (They stop walking.  Under them, another truck starts to dump it's contents.)\r\n\r\n Three of them have already deposited their loads.\r\n\r\n MULDER: So he could have already been here and gone?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: If he hasn't, he will be.\r\n\r\n MULDER: And every tanker dumps it's load here?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: It's a state law.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Everything is processed through this plant?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Yup.\r\n\r\n (They start down the rest of the stairs.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Then what happens to it?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Empties through an outlet pipe about five miles out to sea.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Could this thing have escaped through that outlet pipe?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Doubtful.  The system's full of enough filters and screens that nothing much bigger than your little finger's going to get through.  If it's here... it's going to be trapped here.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Guess all we can do is wait.\r\n\r\n (They stop and look out at the giant system of pipes.  Later, Mulder is walking the planks, looking down into the water.  Other men are doing this as well, including the foreman, inspecting the water.  Mulder's cellular phone rings.)\r\n\r\n Mulder.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: It's me, where are you?\r\n\r\n MULDER: I'm at the treatment plant.  I was playing a hunch it might have gotten back into the system.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: How?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Forget it, it's stupid.\r\n\r\n (Cut to Scully, sitting at a desk.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Well, you're not going to like what I have to tell you?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Why not?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: It hadn't occurred to me, but I think that the fluke in the corpse might have been an incubating larva.\r\n\r\n (Cut back to Mulder.)\r\n\r\n This... creature, or whatever it is...\r\n\r\n (Cut back to Scully.)\r\n\r\n Is transmitting it's eggs or larvae through it's bite.\r\n\r\n (Cut to Mulder.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: You mean it's trying to reproduce?\r\n\r\n (Cut to Scully.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: It's looking for hosts.  It attacks because the victims' bodies provide generative nourishment.  Mulder...\r\n\r\n MULDER: Yeah...\r\n\r\n SCULLY: If it finds a new host...\r\n\r\n (Cut to Mulder.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: I know, Scully.  It could multiply.\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Agent Mulder!\r\n\r\n (Mulder pulls the phone from his ear and looks behind to see the foreman yelling to him.)\r\n\r\n Linesman spotting something down in a section of pipe!\r\n\r\n MULDER: Where?\r\n\r\n (Inside, the foreman unrolls a blueprint of the pipe system.  He points to a section.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Here.\r\n\r\n MULDER: That's near where we found the first body.\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Right, except this is an old overflow system that dumps into the harbor during heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\n MULDER: That must be where it got into the system.\r\n\r\n (The foreman nods.)\r\n\r\n It's working it's way back out to sea.\r\n\r\n (They look at each other, worried.  Mulder and the foreman race to a sewer grate where workers are standing by.  Mulder grabs a flashlight from one of them and heads down.  The foreman follows.  Mulder has to cover his nose from the smell.)\r\n\r\n Mmm...\r\n\r\n (The foreman also has a flashlight.  The waters are bubbling, moving quickly, and they walk on a plank above it, shining their flashlights down.  The foreman shines his on a pipe.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: That's the overflow pipe.  It leads to another vault like this one, then it goes three-quarters of a mile to the sea.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Let's see if we can get that gate closed.\r\n\r\n (The foreman nods and crawls under the ledge.  He stays close to the wall, careful not to fall in, then leans down and unchains the lever.  He pulls on it.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: It's rusted in position!  See if I can get some leverage here.\r\n\r\n (He tries harder.  Mulder looks around the water desperately.  He feels some water trickling down from above and wipes it off his shoulder.  The foreman, however, slips and falls into the water with a short scream as he loses his footing.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Hey!\r\n\r\n (The foreman stands up in the pretty shallow water, which comes up to his chest.  He has no glasses on.)\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Aw, damn it!\r\n\r\n MULDER: You all right?\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Yeah, I lost my... ah!\r\n\r\n (He is pulled under.  Mulder whips out his gun, searching for signs of the fluke.  The foreman surfaces.)\r\n\r\n Help!  Help!\r\n\r\n (Mulder gets down on the plank and reaches out to him.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: Give me your hand!\r\n\r\n FOREMAN: Get me out of here!  Get me out of here!  Grab it!\r\n\r\n (Mulder manages to grab the foreman's hand, but the Flukeman is still obviously tugging on the foreman, because he screams and starts to slip away.  Mulder groans, trying to hold on, but the foreman is dragged under.)\r\n\r\n MULDER: We need some help down here!\r\n\r\n (He jumps into the water and looks around.)\r\n\r\n Hey!\r\n\r\n (Some water trickles down onto him.  Suddenly, the foreman stands up, back arched, screaming.)\r\n\r\n I'll get you out of here!\r\n\r\n (He notices some movement in the water.  He grabs the foreman and positions him under the ledge, where the foreman grabs on.  He is apparently in shock, screaming.)\r\n\r\n Hold on!  Hold on!  You all right?  You all right?\r\n\r\n (There is a banging.  Mulder spins around to see the Fluke trying to get into the pipe.  Mulder runs over and jumps on a pipe on the ground, then strains on the lever as the Flukeman gets about halfway into the pipe.  Mulder falls as the lever moves, sending the gate crashing down, severing the Fluke in half.  The Flukeman screams a high-pitched whine.  The foreman has pulled himself up slightly now, gasping, staring at the severed legs floating in the water, blood all around them.  Mulder sighs in relief.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 19 \r\n WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n (Mulder is sitting on a bench, looking out at the Lincoln Memorial, in the exact same spot where he and Deep Throat once talked.  Scully walks over.)\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Is this seat taken?\r\n\r\n MULDER: No.  But I should warn you, I may reek a bit out of the sewer.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: I'll take my chances.\r\n\r\n (She sits and sighs.)\r\n\r\n You talked to Skinner yesterday.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Success in our work is imperative, Scully.  Reinstatement of the X-Files must be undeniable.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: That came from Skinner?\r\n\r\n MULDER: No. "

        "text":"Ye're smarter than I am, I suppose.  Ye know more about the world than I do, or any one else that might want to say anythin' to ye.  I've raised ye to be a fine lady, and this is what I get.  Talk about me not bein' able to understand, and ye lovin' a convict-to-be, a robber, an embezzler, a bankrupt, a lyin', thavin'—\"\r\n\r\n \"Father!\"  exclaimed Aileen, determinedly.  \"I'll not listen to you talking that way.  He's not any of the things that you say.  I'll not stay here.\"  She moved toward the door;  but Butler jumped up now and stopped her.  His face for the moment was flushed and swollen with anger.\r\n\r\n \"But I'm not through with him yet,\" he went on, ignoring her desire to leave, and addressing her direct—confident now that she was as capable as another of understanding him.  \"I'll get him as sure as I have a name.  There's law in this land, and I'll have it on him.  I'll show him whether he'll come sneakin' into dacent homes and robbin' parents of their children.\"\r\n\r\n He paused after a time for want of breath and Aileen stared, her face tense and white.  Her father could be so ridiculous.  He was, contrasted with Cowperwood and his views, so old-fashioned.  To think he could be talking of some one coming into their home and stealing her away from him, when she had been so willing to go.  What silliness!  And yet, why argue?  What good could be accomplished, arguing with him here in this way?  And so for the moment, she said nothing more—merely looked.  But Butler was by no means done.  His mood was too stormy even though he was doing his best now to subdue himself.\r\n\r\n \"It's too bad, daughter,\" he resumed quietly, once he was satisfied that she was going to have little, if anything, to say.  \"I'm lettin' my anger get the best of me.  It wasn't that I intended talkin' to ye about when I ast ye to come in.  It's somethin' else I have on me mind.  I was thinkin', perhaps, ye'd like to go to Europe for the time bein' to study music.  Ye're not quite yourself just at present.  Ye're needin' a rest.  It would be good for ye to go away for a while.  Ye could have a nice time over there.  Norah could go along with ye, if you would, and Sister Constantia that taught you.  Ye wouldn't object to havin' her, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n At the mention of this idea of a trip of Europe again, with Sister Constantia and music thrown in to give it a slightly new form, Aileen bridled, and yet half-smiled to herself now.  It was so ridiculous—so tactless, really, for her father to bring up this now, and especially after denouncing Cowperwood and her, and threatening all the things he had.  Had he no diplomacy at all where she was concerned?  It was really too funny!  But she restrained herself here again, because she felt as well as saw, that argument of this kind was all futile now.\r\n\r\n \"I wish you wouldn't talk about that, father,\" she began, having softened under his explanation.  \"I don't want to go to Europe now.  I don't want to leave Philadelphia.  I know you want me to go;  but I don't want to think of going now.  I can't.\"\r\n\r\n Butler's brow darkened again.  What was the use of all this opposition on her part?  Did she really imagine that she was going to master him—her father, and in connection with such an issue as this?  How impossible!  But tempering his voice as much as possible, he went on, quite softly, in fact.  \"But it would be so fine for ye, Aileen.  Ye surely can't expect to stay here after—\" He paused, for he was going to say \"what has happened.\"  He knew she was very sensitive on that point.  His own conduct in hunting her down had been such a breach of fatherly courtesy that he knew she felt resentful, and in a way properly so.  Still, what could be greater than her own crime?  \"After,\" he concluded, \"ye have made such a mistake ye surely wouldn't want to stay here.  Ye won't be wantin' to keep up that—committin' a mortal sin.  It's against the laws of God and man.\"\r\n\r\n He did so hope the thought of sin would come to Aileen—the enormity of her crime from a spiritual point of view—but Aileen did not see it at all.\r\n\r\n \"You don't understand me, father,\" she exclaimed, hopelessly toward the end.  \"You can't.  I have one idea, and you have another.  But I don't seem to be able to make you understand now.  The fact is, if you want to know it, I don't believe in the Catholic Church any more, so there.\"\r\n\r\n The moment Aileen had said this she wished she had not.  It was a slip of the tongue.  Butler's face took on an inexpressibly sad, despairing look.\r\n\r\n \"Ye don't believe in the Church?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"No, not exactly—not like you do.\"\r\n\r\n He shook his head.\r\n\r\n \"The harm that has come to yer soul!\"  he replied.  \"It's plain to me, daughter, that somethin' terrible has happened to ye.  This man has ruined ye, body and soul.  Somethin' must be done.  I don't want to be hard on ye, but ye must leave Philadelphy.  Ye can't stay here.  I can't permit ye.  Ye can go to Europe, or ye can go to yer aunt's in New Orleans;  but ye must go somewhere.  I can't have ye stayin' here—it's too dangerous.  It's sure to be comin' out.  The papers'll be havin' it next.  Ye're young yet.  Yer life is before you.  I tremble for yer soul;  but so long as ye're young and alive ye may come to yer senses.  It's me duty to be hard.  It's my obligation to you and the Church.  Ye must quit this life.  Ye must lave this man.  Ye must never see him any more.  I can't permit ye.  He's no good.  He has no intintion of marrying ye, and it would be a crime against God and man if he did.  No, no!  Never that!  The man's a bankrupt, a scoundrel, a thafe.  If ye had him, ye'd soon be the unhappiest woman in the world.  He wouldn't be faithful to ye.  No, he couldn't.  He's not that kind.\"  He paused, sick to the depths of his soul.  \"Ye must go away.  I say it once and for all.  I mane it kindly, but I want it.  I have yer best interests at heart.  I love ye;  but ye must.  I'm sorry to see ye go—I'd rather have ye here.  No one will be sorrier;  but ye must.  Ye must make it all seem natcheral and ordinary to yer mother;  but ye must go—d'ye hear?  Ye must.\"\r\n\r\n He paused, looking sadly but firmly at Aileen under his shaggy eyebrows.  She knew he meant this.  It was his most solemn, his most religious expression.  But she did not answer.  She could not.  What was the use?  Only she was not going.  She knew that—and so she stood there white and tense.\r\n\r\n \"Now get all the clothes ye want,\" went on Butler, by no means grasping her true mood.  \"Fix yourself up in any way you plase.  Say where ye want to go, but get ready.\"\r\n\r\n \"But I won't, father,\" finally replied Aileen, equally solemnly, equally determinedly.  \"I won't go!  I won't leave Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n \"Ye don't mane to say ye will deliberately disobey me when I'm asking ye to do somethin' that's intended for yer own good, will ye daughter?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, I will,\" replied Aileen, determinedly.  \"I won't go!  I'm sorry, but I won't!\"\r\n\r\n \"Ye really mane that, do ye?\"  asked Butler, sadly but grimly.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, I do,\" replied Aileen, grimly, in return.\r\n\r\n \"Then I'll have to see what I can do, daughter,\" replied the old man.  \"Ye're still my daughter, whatever ye are, and I'll not see ye come to wreck and ruin for want of doin' what I know to be my solemn duty.  I'll give ye a few more days to think this over, but go ye must.  There's an end of that.  There are laws in this land still.  There are things that can be done to those who won't obey the law.  I found ye this time—much as it hurt me to do it.  I'll find ye again if ye try to disobey me.  Ye must change yer ways.  I can't have ye goin' on as ye are.  Ye understand now.  It's the last word.  Give this man up, and ye can have anything ye choose.  Ye're my girl—I'll do everything I can in this world to make ye happy.  Why, why shouldn't I?  What else have I to live for but me children?  It's ye and the rest of them that I've been workin' and plannin' for all these years.  Come now, be a good girl.  Ye love your old father, don't ye?  Why, I rocked ye in my arms as a baby, Aileen.  I've watched over ye when ye were not bigger than what would rest in me two fists here.  I've been a good father to ye— ye can't deny that.  Look at the other girls you've seen.  Have any of them had more nor what ye have had?  Ye won't go against me in this.  I'm sure ye won't.  Ye can't.  Ye love me too much—surely ye do—don't ye?\"  His voice weakened.  His eyes almost filled.\r\n\r\n He paused and put a big, brown, horny hand on Aileen's arm.  She had listened to his plea not unmoved—really more or less softened— because of the hopelessness of it.  She could not give up Cowperwood.  Her father just did not understand.  He did not know what love was.  Unquestionably he had never loved as she had.\r\n\r\n She stood quite silent while Butler appealed to her.\r\n\r\n \"I'd like to, father,\" she said at last and softly, tenderly.  \"Really I would.  I do love you.  Yes, I do.  I want to please you;  but I can't in this—I can't!  I love Frank Cowperwood.  You don't understand—really you don't!\"\r\n\r\n At the repetition of Cowperwood's name Butler's mouth hardened.  He could see that she was infatuated—that his carefully calculated plea had failed.  So he must think of some other way.\r\n\r\n \"Very well, then,\" he said at last and sadly, oh, so sadly, as Aileen turned away.  \"Have it yer own way, if ye will.  Ye must go, though, willy-nilly.  It can't be any other way.  I wish to God it could.\"\r\n\r\n Aileen went out, very solemn, and Butler went over to his desk and sat down.  \"Such a situation!\"  he said to himself.  Such a complication!\" \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXVIII\r\n\r\n The situation which confronted Aileen was really a trying one.  A girl of less innate courage and determination would have weakened and yielded.  For in spite of her various social connections and acquaintances, the people to whom Aileen could run in an emergency of the present kind were not numerous.  She could scarcely think of any one who would be likely to take her in for any lengthy period, without question.  There were a number of young women of her own age, married and unmarried, who were very friendly to her, but there were few with whom she was really intimate.  The only person who stood out in her mind, as having any real possibility of refuge for a period, was a certain Mary Calligan, better known as \"Mamie\" among her friends, who had attended school with Aileen in former years and was now a teacher in one of the local schools.\r\n\r\n The Calligan family consisted of Mrs. Katharine Calligan, the mother, a dressmaker by profession and a widow—her husband, a house-mover by trade, having been killed by a falling wall some ten years before—and Mamie, her twenty-three-year-old daughter.  They lived in a small two-story brick house in Cherry Street, near Fifteenth.  Mrs. Calligan was not a very good dressmaker, not good enough, at least, for the Butler family to patronize in their present exalted state.  Aileen went there occasionally for gingham house-dresses, underwear, pretty dressing-gowns, and alterations on some of her more important clothing which was made by a very superior modiste in Chestnut Street.  She visited the house largely because she had gone to school with Mamie at St. Agatha's, when the outlook of the Calligan family was much more promising.  Mamie was earning forty dollars a month as the teacher of a sixth-grade room in one of the nearby public schools, and Mrs. Calligan averaged on the whole about two dollars a day—sometimes not so much.  The house they occupied was their own, free and clear, and the furniture which it contained suggested the size of their joint income, which was somewhere near eighty dollars a month.\r\n\r\n Mamie Calligan was not good-looking, not nearly as good-looking as her mother had been before her.  Mrs. Calligan was still plump, bright, and cheerful at fifty, with a fund of good humor.  Mamie was somewhat duller mentally and emotionally.  She was serious-minded— made so, perhaps, as much by circumstances as by anything else, for she was not at all vivid, and had little sex magnetism.  Yet she was kindly, honest, earnest, a good Catholic, and possessed of that strangely excessive ingrowing virtue which shuts so many people off from the world—a sense of duty.  To Mamie Calligan duty (a routine conformity to such theories and precepts as she had heard and worked by since her childhood) was the all-important thing, her principal source of comfort and relief;  her props in a queer and uncertain world being her duty to her Church;  her duty to her school;  her duty to her mother;  her duty to her friends, etc.  Her mother often wished for Mamie's sake that she was less dutiful and more charming physically, so that the men would like her.\r\n\r\n In spite of the fact that her mother was a dressmaker, Mamie's clothes never looked smart or attractive—she would have felt out of keeping with herself if they had.  Her shoes were rather large, and ill-fitting;  her skirt hung in lifeless lines from her hips to her feet, of good material but seemingly bad design.  At that time the colored \"jersey,\" so-called, was just coming into popular wear, and, being close-fitting, looked well on those of good form.  Alas for Mamie Calligan!  The mode of the time compelled her to wear one;  but she had neither the arms nor the chest development which made this garment admirable.  Her hat, by choice, was usually a pancake affair with a long, single feather, which somehow never seemed to be in exactly the right position, either to her hair or her face.  At most times she looked a little weary;  but she was not physically weary so much as she was bored.  Her life held so little of real charm;  and Aileen Butler was unquestionably the most significant element of romance in it.\r\n\r\n"

Cole sees himself as a kind of avenging angel.  In his mind, everyone responsible for the atrocities, whether directly or indirectly, must be punished.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Yeah, but why now.  Why after all these years.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres of the war.  Over 300 children slaughtered.  But unlike My Lai, no US troops were ever charged.  The 24th anniversary of the massacre was two days ago.\r\n\r\n Mulder’s cell phone rings.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Mulder.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: I think I found the Francis Gerardi you’re looking for.  He’s a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Do you have his number in Boston?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Yes, except he’s coming to New York for Grissom’s funeral, tonight.  He’S arriving at bronx station on the 7:30 train.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Try to have a photograph waiting for us at the security desk so we know who we’re looking for, okay?\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Got it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 16\r\n Mulder and Krycek arrive at the station.  They acquire the photograph and run to find him.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Stay here, I’ll cover you on the side.\r\n\r\n Mulder thinks he sees Gerardi. .\r\n\r\n MULDER: Federal Agent!  Drop your weapon.\r\n\r\n Mulder fires four shots.\r\n\r\n Krycek runs towards him.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Mulder.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Gerardi!  Where is he?\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Gerardi’s not here.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I saw him.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Mulder!  You were shouting and waving your gun around, but Gerardi never showed.\r\n\r\n MULDER: No, Gerardi was here, and so was Cole.  We just missed them.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Mulder, if they had been here, I would have seen it.  I’m telling you Mulder, they weren’t here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 17 \r\n Mulder and Krycek go to the security office at the station.\r\n MULDER: Okay, there’s nothing here.  Start with a small window of time, say 1935 to 1945.  If you don’t find anything in that time frame, then open it up one minute at a time.  With all these cameras, we should be able to see something.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Can we talk for a second.\r\n\r\n MULDER: What’s the problem.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: You still haven’t answered my question.  What happened?\r\n\r\n MULDER: I told you, I thought I saw Gerardi.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Come on, you just about killed somebody back there.  We both know I’m covering for you by keeping it between us.\r\n\r\n MULDER: All right, what do you want to know.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: What’s the truth?  There are things you’re not telling me that I need to know.\r\n\r\n MULDER: It’s just that my ideas usually aren’t very popular.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: I told you, I want to believe.  But I need a place to start.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I think that Cole possesses the psychic ability to manipulate sounds and images to generate illusions that are so convincing they can kill.  How’s that for a theory.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Puts a whole new spin on virtual reality but at least it begins to explain some things.\r\n\r\n SECURITY OFFICER: Agent Mulder, see this car in the upper right corner?\r\n\r\n MULDER: Yeah.\r\n\r\n SECURITY OFFICER: It wasn’t there five minutes ago.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Where is this.\r\n\r\n SECURITY OFFICER: Track 17.  It’s a restricted part of the yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 18\r\n Scene flashes to Cole and Gerardi.\r\n\r\n GERARDI: What are you doing?  This is insane.  You can’t do this to me.  You can’t hold me responsible.  I was following orders, just like you.\r\n\r\n COLE: The lord hates the lying tongue.\r\n\r\n GERARDI: It’s the truth.\r\n\r\n Cole hits Gerardi.\r\n\r\n COLE: The truth is what you did to us.  What you made us do.\r\n\r\n GERARDI: No one Made you do anything.  You volunteered.\r\n\r\n COLE: The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.\r\n\r\n GERARDI: Who is it?  Who’s there.\r\n\r\n COLE: He shall wash his feet in the wicked\r\n\r\n GERARDI: Who is it.  I can’t see without my glasses.\r\n\r\n COLE: You don’t need to see to know who it is.  You know who it is!\r\n\r\n Troops are seen walking by and they pick up scalpels.\r\n\r\n COLE: You shall pay as the judge has determined.  We shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn.  Wound for wound, strike for strike.  As he has disfigured a man, so shall he be disfigured.  And he who kills a man shall be put to death.\r\n\r\n Mulder and Krycek drive in.\r\n\r\n GERARDI: AHHHH!!!!\r\n\r\n They search the place.\r\n\r\n MULDER: He’s still alive.  Put pressure on the wound on the back of his neck and radio for help.  NOW!\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: This is Agent Krycek requesting emergency assistance.  My location is track 17 in the freight way house.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Step away from the edge.  Corporal Cole, I’m a federal agent, now please, step back.\r\n\r\n COLE: Go ahead, shoot me.\r\n\r\n MULDER: That’s not why I’m here.  I’m putting down my gun.  I just want to talk to you for a few minutes, after that, you’re free to do whatever you want.\r\n\r\n COLE: I’m tired.\r\n\r\n MULDER: I know.\r\n\r\n COLE: Naw, man, you don’t know.  You have no idea.\r\n\r\n MULDER: One minute is all I’m asking.\r\n\r\n COLE: One minute is more than I can give.  My blood’s boilin’ in my veins.  I can feel the air stingin’ on my skin.\r\n\r\n MULDER: What the military did to you was wrong, but your testimony can help.\r\n\r\n COLE: They cut out a part of my brain.  They made me into somebody else.  I can never get back what they took away from me, and I’m gonna stop them from taking anything more.\r\n\r\n Krycek walks into the room and extends his weapon.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Krycek put down the gun and get out of here.  Krycek, I said put down the gun and get out of here!\r\n\r\n Krycek sees Cole raising a gun.  When Mulder looks over, he sees Cole raising his bible.\r\n\r\n MULDER: NO!!!!!!\r\n\r\n Krycek fires his gun twice, killing Cole.\r\n\r\n COLE: Good-night.\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: He had a gun.  He was gonna shoot you.\r\n\r\n MULDER: You did the right thing.\r\n\r\n Mulder reaches under his car seat to find that the file is gone.  He goes to Scully’s office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 19\r\n SCULLY: They broke into my office.  Went through my files, my computer. .  .I came as soon as security called but the report was all ready gone.\r\n\r\n MULDER: Someone went through a lot of trouble stealing both our copies to keep this a secret.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Without that report as evidence, Skinner’s not going to authorize an investigation.\r\n\r\n MULDER: He said it’s never been more dangerous.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Skinner?\r\n\r\n MULDER: No, the man who leaked us the report.  The one who’s been helping us.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: You actually met with him.\r\n\r\n MULDER: He said that closing down the X-Files was just the beginning.  That we’ve never been in greater danger.\r\n\r\n SCULLY: Do you trust him \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n SCENE 20\r\n Scene flashes to Krycek in front of three members of the \r\n Consortium.\r\n\r\n CANCERMAN: Do you know where he got this?\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Not yet.  But he got it.  Which means he’s either found another source, or another source has found him.  Sir, if I can recommend something.  You’ll see that I have outlined several counter measures.\r\n\r\n CANCERMAN: What about Scully?\r\n\r\n KRYCEK: Reassigning them to other areas seems to have only strengthened their determination.  Scully’s a problem.  A much larger problem than you described.\r\n\r\n CANCERMAN: Every problem has a solution.\r\n\r\n He puts out his cigarette.\r\n\r\n [THE END]"
