        "text":"Stack Overflow – like most online communities I've studied – naturally trends toward increased strictness over time.  It's primarily a defense mechanism, an immune system of the sort a child develops after first entering school or daycare and being exposed to the wide, wide world of everyday sneezes and coughs with the occasional meningitis outbreak.  It isn't always a pleasant process, but it is, unfortunately, a necessary one if you want to survive.\r\n\r\n Consider this question from two years ago:\r\n\r\n  New programming jargon you coined?\r\n\r\n What programming terms have you coined that have taken off in your own circles (i.e. have heard others repeat it)?  It might be within your own team, workplace or garnered greater popularity on the Internet.\r\n\r\n Write your programming term, word or phrase in bold text followed by an explanation, citation and/or usage example so we can use it in appropriate context.\r\n\r\n Don't repeat common jargon already ingrained in the programming culture like: kludge, automagically, cruft, etc. (unless you coined it).\r\n\r\n This question serves in the spirit of communication among programmers through sharing of terminology with each other, to benefit us by its propagation within our own teams and environments.\r\n\r\n Is this even a question, really?  How many answers does it have?\r\n\r\n Three hundred and eighty six!\r\n\r\n A question that invites 386 different \"answers\" isn't a question at all.  It's an opinion survey, a poll, a List of X.  I suppose you could argue that reading through all those responses would teach you something about programming, but it was pretty clear that the bulk of the responses were far more about laughs and GTKY (Getting to Know You) than learning.  That's why it was eventually deleted by experienced Stack Overflow community members.  Although it is somewhat borderline in terms of learning, and I didn't personally vote to delete it, I tend to agree that it was correctly deleted.  Though opinions vary.\r\n\r\n I won't bore you with the entire history, our so-called \"war on fun\", and the trouble with popularity.  Ultimately, Stack Overflow is a college, not a frat house.  All the content on the site must exist to serve the mission of learning over entertainment – even if that means making difficult calls about removing some questions and answers that fail to meet those goals, plus or minus 10 percent.\r\n\r\n In terms of programmer culture, though, there is precedent in the form of The Jargon File.  Unfortunately, we don't have a good designated place for deleted \"too fun\" questions to live, but all Stack Exchange content is licensed under Creative Commons in perpetuity.  Which means, with proper attribution, we can give it a permanent home on our own blogs.  So I did.  I've collected the top 30 Stack Overflow New Programming Jargon entries below, as judged by the Stack Overflow community.  Enjoy. *\r\n 1.  Yoda Conditions\r\n zneak\r\n\r\n Yoda-conditions\r\n\r\n Using if(constant == variable) instead of if(variable == constant), like if(4 == foo).  Because it's like saying \"if blue is the sky\" or \"if tall is the man\".\r\n 2.  Pokémon Exception Handling\r\n woot4moo\r\n\r\n Pokemon\r\n\r\n For when you just Gotta Catch 'Em All.\r\n\r\n try {\r\n }\r\n catch (Exception ex) {\r\n // Gotcha!\r\n }\r\n\r\n 3.  Egyptian Brackets\r\n computronium\r\n\r\n Egyptian\r\n\r\n You know the style of brackets where the opening brace goes on the end of the current line, e.g.  this?\r\n\r\n if (a == b) {\r\n printf(\"hello\");\r\n }\r\n\r\n We used to refer to this style of brackets as \"Egyptian brackets\".  Why?  Compare the position of the brackets with the hands in the picture.  (This style of brackets is used in Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language, so it's known by many as K&R style.)\r\n 4.  Smug Report\r\n aaronaught\r\n\r\n Pathreport-med\r\n\r\n A bug submitted by a user who thinks he knows a lot more about the system's design than he really does.  Filled with irrelevant technical details and one or more suggestions (always wrong) about what he thinks is causing the problem and how we should fix it.\r\n\r\n Also related to Drug Report (a report so utterly incomprehensible that whoever submitted it must have been smoking crack.) , Chug Report (where the submitter is thought to have had one too many), and Shrug Report (a bug report with no error message or repro steps and only a vague description of the problem.  Usually contains the phrase \"doesn't work.\")\r\n 5.  A Duck\r\n kyoryu\r\n\r\n Duck-wireframe\r\n\r\n A feature added for no other reason than to draw management attention and be removed, thus avoiding unnecessary changes in other aspects of the product.\r\n\r\n I don't know if I actually invented this term or not, but I am certainly not the originator of the story that spawned it.\r\n\r\n This started as a piece of Interplay corporate lore.  It was well known that producers (a game industry position, roughly equivalent to PMs) had to make a change to everything that was done.  The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.\r\n\r\n The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution.  He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck.  He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners.  He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the \"actual\" animation.\r\n\r\n Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen.  The producer sat down and watched all of the animations.  When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, \"that looks great.  Just one thing - get rid of the duck.\"\r\n 6.  Refuctoring\r\n Jason Gorman\r\n\r\n Bottle-smashing\r\n\r\n The process of taking a well-designed piece of code and, through a series of small, reversible changes, making it completely unmaintainable by anyone except yourself.\r\n 7.  Stringly Typed\r\n Mark Simpson\r\n\r\n Cat-string-values\r\n\r\n A riff on strongly typed.  Used to describe an implementation that needlessly relies on strings when programmer & refactor friendly options are available.\r\n\r\n For example:\r\n\r\n  Method parameters that take strings when other more appropriate types should be used.\r\n On the occasion that a string is required in a method call (e.g.  network service), the string is then passed and used throughout the rest of the call graph without first converting it to a more suitable internal representation (e.g.  parse it and create an enum, then you have strong typing throughout the rest of your codebase).\r\n Message passing without using typed messages etc. \r\n\r\n Excessively stringly typed code is usually a pain to understand and detonates at runtime with errors that the compiler would normally find.\r\n 8.  Heisenbug\r\n unknown\r\n\r\n Heisenbug\r\n\r\n A computer bug that disappears or alters its characteristics when an attempt is made to study it.  (Wikipedia)\r\n 9.  Doctype Decoration\r\n Zurahn\r\n\r\n Charlie-brown-christmas-tree\r\n\r\n When web designers add a doctype declaration but don't bother to write valid markup.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"It is believed that humans act for different reasons;  but for whom, or what, do or should they act?  Is the reason humans act for themselves, for God, for the reaction of other people, or for the benefit of the planet?  Is it even believable that we have a choice as to why we act and for whom?  Is it possible for an individual to ever act only according to his or her own interests, without ever regarding others’ interests?  On the other hand, is it possible for an individual to ever truly act for the benefit and / or betterment of others in complete disregard for his or her own interests?  An egoist would argue against that idea, because egoism states that an action is right if and only if said action promotes long-term, rational self-interest, as long as it obeys the moral side constraints.  This would mean that Mother Theresa is helping the poor solely because it makes her feel good about herself.  Although it may sound somewhat outlandish, it definitely rings true in some ears.  Although I do not completely agree with egoism, it certainly does make sense and it is absolutely being displayed in the world around us.  Whether humans are naturally born and necessarily selfish, in order to survive, and it is out of their control or it only makes sense to humans for them to act in favor of their self-interest, egoism stands true.\r\n\r\n From early in our existence, all human beings become aware that it is satisfying to eat when they are hungry, sleep when they are tired and unpleasant to touch something that burns them.  Humans become aware of this because eating stops their hunger pains;  sleeping stops the feeling of tiredness and not touching the fire prevents pain due to burning.  These sensations of pleasure and pain give humans the knowledge of the goodness and badness in certain things, in much the same way as the senses of sight, smell, sound, taste and touch give humans knowledge of the existence of things.  As a result of said knowledge, humans are able to form valid moral principles through induction, and therefore are able to apply those principles to specific situations for which our senses by themselves are not suitable to handle.  Without this foundation, the knowledge of moral and immoral would not be possible, and consequently morality would be a measly false notion.  In addition, one could argue that it is simply a predisposed survival instinct for humans to act in a manner that promotes their self-interest and that instinct is what brought man-kind to what it is today.  In others words, our choices can really be considered predetermined by the knowledge gained in previously learned experiences, if it is that we choose to act in a manner which promotes our self-interest.  What if humans had the ability to give up there desires and just concentrate on what’s best for others and / or the world in general?  Would life as we know it be the same if humans did not have the determination to achieve their desires?  Absolutely not, this would a very classless and unknowledgeable society.  Consequently, society as a whole is better off if each person works to bring about his or her own self-interests.\r\n\r\n In all voluntary actions humans do what they want, as it doesn’t make sense to do something they don’t want to do, and when they do what they want their actions are therefore considered to be selfish.  Would it make sense to act in any other manner, as long as the action is rational?  It is unreasonable to expect one to act in a manner in which they do not agree with, do not like, or find unfulfilling.  So, in agreement with Ana Rand, it is basically a moral duty to pursue one’s own interests.  This is the case because if acting in one’s own self-interest is reasonable, then it is a moral requirement that one acts in one’s own self-interest.  Additionally, if people pursue their own interests as they conceive them, then the interests of everyone is promoted.  It goes back to the old saying, «you can not make anyone else happy, if you are not happy yourself».\r\n\r\n Whether it is humans’ naturally learned and necessary instinct to be selfish, in order to survive, or it only makes sense to humans for them to act in favor of their self-interest, egoism remains in the world around us.  Although the previously suggested points of view differ greatly, due to the fact that one point of view states selfish is natural and out of humans’ control and the other point of view states it would simply not make sense to not be selfish, they both arrive at the same conclusion.  The world is a better, happier and more production place if everyone acted in a manner which promotes their own long-term, rational self-interest, without disobeying the moral side constraints.  Although I do believe these points of view are convincing, I also believe they do have their weakness due to lack of balance.  Balance is always necessary and anything at an extreme can not be considered completely positive.  While, it is reasonable and necessary for humans to act in a manner which does promote their self-interest, I do not believe or agree that it is necessary for one to act in said manner, exclusively."

        "text":"To answer this question, let us first define language and knowledge.  Language is any system of formalized symbols, signs, sounds, gestures, or the like used or conceived as a means of communicating.1While  knowledge is a justified true belief.  In my opinion, language is an important way of knowing;  however it is not the most important.\r\n\r\n Language is not restricted to merely words, it encompasses actions as well.  Without it, how can we communicate and thus obtain knowledge.  We often acquire knowledge from books, teachings and actions.  With that in mind, let us ask ourselves: What would we understand from these if there were no language in the world?  Nothing.  However, language is biased.  Who is to say whether a person is a terrorist or freedom fighter, after all, the definitions of these two words are similar, but their connotations are different.\r\n It may be argued that language is only one of the four ways of knowing, however, I would like to emphasize that language is the basis of emotion, reason and perception.  People may say that we can infer happiness from a smile;  and sadness from a frown, however, as mentioned earlier, isn’t the smile or frown an action, a language?  Another example of language controlling emotion would be where we are able to derive sorrow from the phrase “I am sorry for your loss”.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, emotions could have control over language.  When we are angry, we would use certain different words as compared to when we are happy.  This means that we emotions control the use of words, in contrast to the earlier view that we use words to express different emotions.\r\n Language is used to perceive.  For example, people are shown three pictures, one of a man about to kick a ball, one of the same man having just kicked a ball, and a third of a different man who is about to kick a ball.  They are then asked which two of the three are the most similar.  Indonesians generally choose the first two pictures, which have the same man in them, while English speakers are likely to identify the two pictures that show the ball about to be kicked — an emphasis on the chronological, rather than the spatial, relationship between the principal objects in the picture.2\r\n However, in different languages the divides between, say, red and pink may be different, but this does not imply that people speaking different languages do not perceive the difference between a darker pink and a lighter pink.  Through this, we can see that humans are capable to perceive the «objective world» overcoming the biases that language may impose.\r\n\r\n The 19th century German Philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt claimed that language was directly connected to thinking.3  I agree with his claim.  We are born with the gift of language.  Even people without the five senses possess some form of language relative to their own existence.  To be able to reason, we need to think, thus we need a medium in which to think, language provides this.  For example, in mathematics, we use symbols to logic out the problem and deduce the result.  These symbols are forms of language.\r\n\r\n Conversely, language is biased, thus it may cloud reason.  Through perception of language, we may have preference for one thing compared to another.  For instance, a biased claim such as “Jimmy Carter is a bigot”4 is full of fallacies, such as the red herring fallacy and the appeal to emotions and novelty.  These fallacies defy reason hence are not knowledge.\r\n\r\n To conclude, I feel that language is a good attempt to link the ways of knowing together, however, it is not without its drawbacks, thus it as yet cannot be considered the most important way of knowing."

Cook\r\n\r\n Baklava\r\n\r\n Code with too many layers.\r\n\r\n Baklava is a delicious pastry made with many paper-thin layers of phyllo dough.  While thin layers are fine for a pastry, thin software layers don’t add much value, especially when you have many such layers piled on each other.  Each layer has to be pushed onto your mental stack as you dive into the code.  Furthermore, the layers of phyllo dough are permeable, allowing the honey to soak through.  But software abstractions are best when they don’t leak.  When you pile layer on top of layer in software, the layers are bound to leak.\r\n 15.

IE, when a user clicks on the button, a SmurfAccountView passes a SmurfAccountDTO to the SmurfAccountController.  The SmurfID is used to fetch a SmurfOrderHistory which is passed to the SmurfHistoryMatch before forwarding to either SmurfHistoryReviewView or SmurfHistoryReportingView.  If a SmurfErrorEvent occurs it is logged by SmurfErrorLogger to ${app}/smurf/log/smurf/smurflog.log\r\n 22.

I used to go to my boss and talk about something and he'd listen and then I'd just answer my own question and walk out without him saying a thing.  I read about someone that put a rubber duck on their monitor so they could talk to it, so rubberducking is talking your way through a problem.\r\n 24.  Banana Banana Banana\r\n juliet\r\n\r\n Dancing-banana\r\n\r\n Placeholder text indicating that documentation is in progress or yet to be completed.  Mostly used because FxCop complains when a public function lacks documentation.\r\n\r\n /// \r\n /// banana banana banana\r\n /// \r\n public CustomerValidationResponse Validate()\r\n\r\n Other food-related jargon: Programmer Fuel (Mountain Dew, coffee, Mate, anything which gets you well-caffeinated), Hot Potato (Http and Https respectively.

And in his laugh there is absolutely no joy or humour.\r\n Warning: this vehicle is reversing.\r\n\r\n I have a complete and total inability to cry.\r\n\r\n Yon see people when they say to you that they can't imagine not believing in anything because it would be just too depressing.  I think there's something sick about that.  The level of cowardice in that is just unbearable to me.\r\n\r\n I've been home for three weeks.\r\n\r\n If this can happen, anything can happen.\r\n\r\n Just now there was this couple outside and they were arguing in the street and it looked like they were deliberately trying to copy characters out of soap operas.  In the way that they argued.  As though the closest they'll ever get to being famous is rowing in the street like they were actually on EastEnders.  The misery and the emptiness and the vacuous fucking silliness of their lives is so considerable that the proximity to the behaviour of soap characters acts as some kind of consolation.\r\n\r\n Helen moves around the house.\r\n\r\n I’m holding my entire head together.  The skin and the shell of me.  I'm failing absolutely inside myself.  But you can see that.  You can see the - in my -\r\n\r\nJust because we don't know doesn't mean we won't know.  We just don't know yet.  But I think one day we will.  I think we will.\r\n\r\n  — END — "

        "text":"All forms of education can be broken down into three main components: planning, instruction, and evaluation.  In the form of education that most people experience, pedagogy, it is the teacher’s responsibility to define each of these components.  Through distance learning, which is majorly based on the principles of andragogy, the learner has more responsibility and influence in defining these components.\r\n\r\n It is extremely beneficial to the learner to not only be active, but to be the main decision-maker in the planning stage of their education.  For this to be effective however, it is important for the learner to first carefully reflect on his or her prior knowledge and experience, needs, interests and goals.  Only the learner himself is able to take inventory of his prior knowledge and experience and therefore decide what he is lacking in order to reach his goals.  With the guidance of an advisor, distance learning allows the student to choose what courses will be relevant to his vocation and complete them at his own pace.  According to the widely accepted information processing theory, learners are more likely to retain information when it is made relevant and meaningful to their interests.  When students take an active role in their own learning process, it is more likely that they will be motivated to complete assignments and reach their goals.\r\n\r\n Because distance learning does not include any teacher-lead classes or meetings, it is majorly the student’s responsibility to learn the material and complete the assignments on his own.  However, distance learning encompasses many resources that can assist the student in this.  There are many technologies on the internet such as libraries, videos and web conferences that can provide a wealth of information for the student.  These technologies are most effective when used in combination with printed materials such as text books and communicative technologies such as e-mail and video conferencing.  The advisor can be very useful in helping the student to recognize these resources and how to use them.\r\n\r\n However, it is once again the student’s responsibility to reflect on his or her own learning style and decide what idea technologies, or study methods best contribute to his or her learning.  Although the resources can provide guidance, structure, and motivation, the concept of andragogy implies that these factors must come from within the student.  Again, because the student plays such an active role in the structure of his education, it is more likely that it will be a meaningful experience.  The information processing theory also states that meaningful practice can help information move into the long term memory.  There, it can be assimilated with existing knowledge and experience to be recalled for practical use.\r\n\r\n As with the first two components of distance learning, the student is active the evaluation process.  Again, reflection and mapping of goals at the beginning of the program can help students track their progress.  Formative assessment as well as meaningful feedback have been proven to help students self-evaluate and re-structure the learning process if necessary.  In other words, when students periodically compare their work to the goals they have set for themselves, they can then decide if the methods they have been using are effective in helping them progress, and then “fine tune” these methods to help them better reach their goals.

        "text":"Bloodstream Marketing just can’t compare.\r\n\r\n Effect on Relationships\r\n When you begin to align yourself with the perspective of higher level consciousness, your relationships with other people will shift.  Try not to be too attached to what happens here.  Your pairings with any one or more individuals aren’t necessarily going to be stable.  It’s how your relationships affect the whole of humanity that matters.  What ripples are you and your relationships co-creating?\r\n\r\n People who aren’t compatible with this new perspective will fade from your life.  At first you may fear that you’re going to end up alone, but there’s no cause for alarm.  New relationships will come into your life, relationships with people who have a similar perspective.  And these relationships will be much better for you than the old ones.  They’ll help you hold the new perspective.\r\n\r\n These new relationships will be different than what you’re used to, however.  There will be less rigidity and more flexibility in this part of your life.  Such relationships may defy traditional labels.  You may feel a bit ungrounded in this new space.  It takes time to get used to it.\r\n\r\n Eventually you’ll realize that happiness and love can come from anywhere.  You may have your emotional needs met equally well by a long-time partner or with someone you just met.  Universal consciousness will guide you to whatever it is that you need to sustain your emotional health, as long as you don’t get too attached to how it shows up.  If you remain open and flexible, your emotional needs can be satisfied with relative ease.  Trust that universal consciousness knows just what you need, and it will deliver it right to you if you’re ready to accept it.  Again, you don’t even have to ask once you’re on this path.  It will satisfy your emotional needs because doing so makes you a better servant.  You can’t serve humanity so well if you’re feeling lonely and disconnected.  You’ll be more motivated if you have love in your life, so love will be delivered unto you.\r\n\r\n Compared to where I was a few years ago, my relationship life might seem a bit strange these days.  I have many relationships that would be difficult to label, but they seem to be healthy and flourishing in ways that are hard to get my head around.  I can’t really define what they are, and I can’t predict where they’re going.  But it seems like these connections are good and healthy for all involved.  My biggest relationship challenge is unloading the traditional-minded baggage that nudges me to lock down and label each relationship, so I can feel like I understand it.  But whenever I fall into that pattern, things get worse, not better.  Conscious relationships don’t seem to like being locked down and labeled.  They require more freedom and flow.\r\n\r\n At first this sort of situation could make a person feel insecure.  You may be accustomed to having a sense of security based on the stability of predictable interactions with people close to you.\r\n\r\n However, when you align yourself with universal consciousness, you’re likely to move around a lot more relationship-wise.  You’re going to meet and interact with a lot more people than you’re used to.  Your social life will be rich and varied.  Your stability has to come from trusting that no matter where you are, your emotional needs will still be satisfied.  You’ll have the opportunity to share love, intimacy, affection, etc., and it can be more abundant than what you experienced at the individual level of being.  I assure you that you won’t have to go it alone.  This isn’t a lonely path  —  it’s actually an incredibly social path.\r\n\r\n Effect on Work\r\n Your work life will be transformed as well.  You’ll probably need to stop thinking of your career in terms of having a stable job and earning a set income.  Serving humanity requires a lot more flexibility and flow than a traditional job can provide.  Thinking of starting or running a business is equally limiting.  This is human level thinking.  What does humanity need?\r\n\r\n Humanity is more concerned with things like creativity, purpose, and expansion.  It would love to see you contribute to the ongoing expansion and evolution of consciousness.  That’s what matters.  The other stuff is too trivial to fuss over.\r\n\r\n I don’t really have a job title.  Sometimes I make one up like President or CEO when it’s required for social convention, but the title is meaningless to me.  When people ask me what I do for a living, I don’t really know what to say.  I don’t do anything for a living.  I just live.  In certain situations I might say that I’m a blogger, author, or speaker, but that’s mainly what I say to people who are asleep and I don’t have time to wake them up in that particular moment.  If I’m talking to someone who’s awake, then either they won’t ask such a silly question, or they’ll understand my honest answer… and they’ll probably share a similar feeling about job titles.\r\n\r\n My business cards have the wrong address because I haven’t updated them in 5 years.  My website obviously isn’t the prettiest one out there.  I’ve never spent money to market or promote my website, book, or workshops.  I don’t think it would be a bad thing to do so;  it just hasn’t ever been necessary.  Humanity takes care of all my marketing and does a better job than I could.\r\n\r\n Last year I uncopyrighted all my blog posts and podcasts, so you have just as much ownership of this article as I do.  From a cellular level, that might seem like a foolish decision.  But that isn’t the level at which I made the decision.  What does a copyright mean to humanity?  Of course it’s meaningless.  What would you think if one of your cells tried to patent the Krebs Cycle?  Silly cells…\r\n\r\n Some people are repackaging and selling my work for money.  Does that bother me?  Of course not.  Even though they may be operating at an individual level of consciousness, they’re actually helping.  They’re spreading ideas that humanity wants to spread;  after all, humanity gave me those ideas to share in the first place.  They’re doing exactly what they’re supposed to be doing.  I think some of them have been donating back to me as well, since I’ve seen a modest increase in donations lately.  But I didn’t do this to get more donations.  I did it because it should help the ideas spread and get more people thinking about living consciously.  It really doesn’t matter which humans get credit or make money from it.\r\n\r\n I think my business actually works better because I don’t manage it with a cellular mindset.  Millions of people have been drawn to my work, and it’s been translated into more languages than I can track.  People keep sharing it, with or without my permission.  New opportunities keep showing up.  Money keeps flowing.  Everything works.  Well, aside from my web server, which I may have to upgrade yet again due to traffic growth.  But that’s a good problem to have, isn’t it?\r\n\r\n Why does my business work?  Because it’s not really a business.  It’s a service, not primarily for individual humans, but for humanity itself.  The purpose is to help enough people wake up and live more consciously, so that humanity itself may continue to survive and thrive.  And by performing this service for humanity, it takes care of all my needs.  It’s really good at it too.  I barely have to lift a finger to attend to such things.  I rather appreciate that.\r\n\r\n Individually speaking, there are some humans out there who don’t particularly like my work.  But that’s largely irrelevant because humanity as a whole has made it abundantly clear that it appreciates what I’m doing and wants to speed things along with further expansion.  These days I largely ignore cellular level feedback because it comes from people at varying levels of wakefulness, so of course they won’t all agree.  But I pay close attention to feedback from universal consciousness, such as whether my life is flowing well or not.  These days it’s flowing amazingly well, so I figure I’m on the right track.\r\n\r\n Is humanity making it abundantly clear that it appreciates what you’re doing?  If not, any guesses as to why?  Could it be that you’ve been ignoring humanity’s needs, and thus it’s been ignoring your needs?  Try doing the opposite and see what happens.  I think you’ll like it.\r\n\r\n Conscious Business\r\n Recently I’ve been listening to an audiobook about the history of Google.  Google began as a fairly idealistic company with the grand mission of organizing and providing access to all the world’s information.  Does that sound like an individual level goal or a goal for humanity itself?  Of course Google has since become a giant, besting all other search companies.  Interestingly, one of the reasons it succeeded is because it attracted some of the brightest minds in the world, people who were inspired by its mission and who would not have worked for the company if it was just about the money.  You could say that humanity diverted the best resources to Google because Google’s mission served the best interests of humanity.  In fact, Google has helped to create a smarter, more self-aware humanity.\r\n\r\n Microsoft used to be a similar purpose-driven company, with the mission of putting “a computer on every desk and in every home.”  That was an expansive goal that served humanity.  But a lot of people now believe Microsoft has lost its way, and sometimes it acts more like a cancerous tumor than a servant to humanity.  Do you believe that Microsoft is here to serve humanity, or mainly itself?  Is it working with the expansion and evolution of humanity, or is it working against it?  Probably a bit of both.  Hence its mixed results and recent stagnation.  Microsoft needs a new mission that aligns with humanity’s expansion.  So far its current attempts at a new mission have been fluffy and noncommittal.  It wastes too much energy on trying to defend its turf, failing to recognize that there’s only one turf, and it belongs to universal consciousness.  If you happen to work for Microsoft, do what you can to wake more people up within your company, and eventually the culture will shift, as will the company’s results.\r\n\r\n The irony is that companies that care less about quarterly returns and more about service to humanity can often achieve amazing growth.  Why?  Because humanity wants those companies to succeed.  It sends them whatever resources they need to succeed.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":" Then he lifted the iron key and fit it into the copper plate.  This key he did not turn.  He slid it deep into the lock, brought it halfway out, then pushed it back before drawing it free in a smooth, quick motion.\r\n After replacing the keys in their box, he put his hands back on the sides of the lid in the same position as before.  “Open,” he said under his breath.  “Open, damn you.  Edro.”\r\n He lifted, his back and shoulders tensing with the effort of it.\r\n The lid of the chest didn’t budge.  Kvothe gave a long sigh and leaned forward until his forehead pressed against the cool dark wood.  As the air rushed out of him, his shoulders sagged, leaving him looking small and wounded, terribly tired and older than his years.\r\n His expression, however, showed no surprise, no grief.  It was merely resigned.  It was the expression of a man who has finally received bad news he’d already known was on the way.\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-TWO Elderberry\r\n It was a bad night to be caught in the open.\r\n The clouds had rolled in late, like a grey sheet pulled across the sky.  The wind was chill and gusty, with fits and starts of rain that spattered down heavily before fading into drizzle.\r\n For all this, the two soldiers camped in a thicket near the road seemed to be enjoying themselves.  They’d found a woodcutter’s stash and built their fire so high and hot that the occasional gust of rain did little more than make it spit and hiss.\r\n The two men were talking loudly, laughing the wild, braying laughter of men too drunk to care about the weather.\r\n Eventually a third man emerged from the dark trees, stepping delicately over the trunk of a nearby fallen tree.  He was wet, if not soaked, and his dark hair was plastered flat to his head.  When the soldiers saw him, they lifted their bottles and called out an enthusiastic greeting.\r\n “Didn’t know if you’d make it,” the blonde soldier said.  “It’s a shit night.  But it’s only fair you get your third.”\r\n “You’re wet through,” said the bearded one, lifting up a narrow yellow bottle.  “Suck on this.  It’s some fruit thing, but it kicks like a pony.”\r\n “Yours is girly piss,” the blonde soldier said, holding up his own.  “Here.  Now this here is a man’s drink.”\r\n The third man looked back and forth as if unable to decide.  Finally he lifted a finger, pointing at one bottle then the other as he began to chant.\r\n Maple.  Maypole.\r\n Catch and carry.\r\n Ash and Ember.\r\n Elderberry.\r\n He ended pointing at the yellow bottle, then gripped it by the neck and lifted to his lips.  He took a long, slow drink, his throat working silently.\r\n “Hey there,” said the bearded soldier.  “Save a bit!”\r\n Bast lowered the bottle and licked his lips.  He gave a dry, humorless chuckle.  “You got the right bottle,” he said.  “It’s elderberry.”\r\n “You’re nowhere near as chatty as you were this morning,” the blonde soldier said, cocking his head to one side.  “You look like your dog died.  Is everything alright?”\r\n “No,” Bast said.  “Nothing’s alright.”\r\n “It ain’t our fault if he figured it out,” the blonde one said quickly.  “We waited a bit after you left, just like you said.  But we’d been sitting for hours already.  Thought you were never going to leave.”\r\n “Hell,” the bearded man said, irritated.  “Does he know?  He throw you out?”\r\n Bast shook his head and tipped the bottle back again.\r\n “Then you ain’t got nothing to complain of.”  The blonde soldier rubbed the side of his head, scowling.  “Silly bastard gave me a lump or two.”\r\n “He got it back with some to spare.”  The bearded soldier grinned, rubbing his thumb across his knuckles.  “He’ll be pissing blood tomorrow.”\r\n “So it’s all good at the end,” the blonde soldier said philosophically, lurching unsteadily as he waved his bottle a little too dramatically.  “You got to skin your knuckles.  I got a drink of something lovely.  And we all made a heavy penny.  Everyone’s happy.  Everyone gets what they wanted most.”\r\n “I didn’t get what I wanted,” Bast said flatly.\r\n “Not yet,” the bearded soldier said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a purse that made a weighty chink as he bounced it in his palm.  “Grab a piece of fire and we’ll divvy this up.”\r\n Bast looked around the circle of firelight, making no move to take a seat.  Then he began to chant again as he pointed at things randomly: a nearby stone, a log, a hatchet . . .\r\n Fallow farrow.\r\n Ash and oak.\r\n Bide and borrow.\r\n Chimney smoke.\r\n He ended pointing at the fire.  He stepped close, stooped low, and pulled out a branch longer than his arm.  The far end was a solid knot of glowing coal.\r\n “Hell, you’re drunker than I am,” the bearded soldier guffawed.  “That’s not what I meant when I said grab a piece of fire.”\r\n The blonde soldier rolled with laughter.\r\n Bast looked down at the two men.  After a moment he began to laugh too.  It was a terrible sound, jagged and joyless.  It was no human laugh.\r\n “Hoy,” the bearded man interrupted sharply, his expression no longer amused.  “What’s the matter with you?”\r\n It began to rain again, a gust of wind spattering heavy drops against Bast’s face.  His eyes were dark and intent.  There was another gust of wind that made the end of the branch flare a brilliant orange.\r\n The hot coal traced a glowing arc through the air as Bast began to point it back and forth between the two men, chanting:\r\nBarrel.  Barley.\r\n Stone and stave.\r\n Wind and water.\r\n Misbehave.\r\n Bast finished with the burning branch pointing at the bearded man.  His teeth were red in the firelight.  His expression was nothing like a smile.\r\n EPILOGUE A Silence of Three Parts\r\n It was night again.  The Waystone Inn lay in silence, and it was a silence of three parts.\r\n The most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking.  If there had been a steady rain it would have drummed against the roof, sluiced the eaves, and washed the silence slowly out to sea.  If there had been lovers in the beds of the inn, they would have sighed and moaned and shamed the silence into being on its way.  If there had been music . . .  but no, of course there was no music.  In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained.\r\n Outside the Waystone, the noise of distant revelry blew faintly through the trees.  A strain of fiddle.  Voices.  Stomping boots and clapping hands.  But the sound was slender as a thread, and a shift in the wind broke it, leaving only rustling leaves and something almost like the far-off shrieking of an owl.  That faded too, leaving nothing but the second silence, waiting like an endless indrawn breath.\r\n The third silence was not an easy thing to notice.  If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the chill metal of a dozen locks turned tight to keep the night away.  It lay in rough clay jugs of cider and the hollow taproom gaps where chairs and tables ought to be. "

        "text":"(This is an extract from the first book of the Old Testament called \"Genesis\".  The name \"Genesis\" means \"origin\".  The book tells us about the creation of the universe and the origin of mankind).\r\n 1.  In th beginning, when God created the universe, the earth was formless and desolate.  The raging ocean that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the spirit of God was moving over the water.  Then God commanded, \"Let there be light\" - and the light appeared.  God was pleased with what he saw.  Then he separated the light from the darkness \"Night\".  Evening passed and morning came - that was the first day. \r\n 2.  Then God commanded, \"Let there be a dome to divide the water and keep it in two separate places\" - and it was done.  So God made a dome, and it separated the water under it from the water above it.  He named the dome \"Sky\".  Evening passed and morning came - that was the second day.\r\n 3.  Then God commanded, \"Let the water below the sky come together in one place, so that the land will appear\" - and it was done.  He named the land \"Earth\", and the water which had come together he named \"Sea\".  And God was pleased with what he saw.  Then he commanded, \"Let the earth produce all kinds of plants, those that bear grain and those that bear fruit\" - and it was done.  So the earth prodeced all kinds of plants, and God was pleased with what he saw.  Evening passed and morning came - that was the third day.\r\n 4.  Then God commanded, \"Let lights appear in the sky to separate day from night and to show the time when days, years, and seasons begin;  they will shine in the sky to give the light to the earth\" - and it was done.  So God made the two larger lights, the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule over the night;  he also made the stars.  He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth, to rule over the day and the night, to separate light from darkness.  And God was pleased with what he saw.  Evening passed and morning came - that was the fourth day.\r\n 5.  Then God commanded, \"Let thw water be filled with many kinds of living beings, and let the air be filled with birds\".  So God created the great sea-monsters, all kind of creatures that live in the water to reproduce, and to fill the sea, and he told the birds to increase in number.  Evening passed and morning came - that was the fifth day.\r\n 6.  Then God commanded, \"Let the earth produce all kinds of animal life: domestic and wild, large and small\" - and it was done.  So God made them all and he was pleased with what he saw.\r\n 7.  The God said, \"And now we will make human beings: the will be like us and resemble us.  They will have power over the fish, the birds, and all animals, domestic and wild, large and small\".  So God created human beings, making them to be like himself.  He crated them male and female, blessed them and said, \"Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control.  I am putting you in charge of the fish, the birds, and all the wild animals.  I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to eat, but for all the wild animals and all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food\" - and it was done.  God looked at everything he had made, and he was very pleased .  Evening passed and morning came - that was the sixth day.\r\n 8.  And so the whole universe was completed.  By the seventh day God finished what he had been doing and stopped working.  He blessed the seventh day and set it apart as a special day, because by that day he had completed his creation and stopped working.  And that is how the universe was created.\r\n (From Good News Bible.  Today's English Version.  - N.Y.  Collins Bible, 1982.  Genesis 1, 2.)"

Out of nowhere, another car slammed into them!\r\n\r\n \"Someone ran a red light and T-boned our car, which flipped it over!\"  James, who was 6-years-old at the time, recalls to M.

The doctors were like, 'This is a little crazy!'\"  And while most kids would be too scared to hop in a car again, James was ready to put the accident behind him.  \"I don't think I understood the severity of the situation at the time, but that's a good thing, because i wasn't afraid of doing anything physical, \" James shares.\r\n\r\n \"I still injure myself doing silly things or playing sports now and again, but luckily i haven't had anything close to that since then.

Paul, the boss, mistakenly thinks Anna's been smoking on company premises and she's trying to explain herself.\r\n\r\n Anna: But, but…\r\n\r\n Paul: Frankly, I'm disappointed with you Anna.  You're a hard worker but it doesn't mean you can go against company policy.\r\n\r\n Narrator: Anna, remember the phrases we've learnt about a misunderstanding!\r\n\r\n Anna: Oh yes.  Paul, I think there's been a misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n Paul: A misunderstanding?  How can you explain the smell of cigarette smoke?  This is a 'no smoking' building.\r\n\r\n Anna: Let me explain.  I went down to the warehouse to speak to Mr Ingle and… well… someone else was smoking.\r\n\r\n Paul: What!?  Someone was smoking in the warehouse?  Golly gosh, that's highly dangerous.  Who was it Anna?\r\n\r\n Anna: Err… well… I can't really say.  But I dealt with it and it won't happen again.\r\n\r\n Narrator: Yes, you dealt with it very well Anna but can you keep your secret about Mr Ingle safe?\r\n\r\n Paul: Thank you Anna and sorry about the misunderstanding.  Would you like a biscuit?  Now I really think it's time we had a review of our health and safety procedures.\r\n\r\n Door opens\r\n\r\n Paul: Denise, could you gather everyone round in the meeting room please.\r\n\r\n Denise: (On phone) I'll have to call you back Marge.  (Hangs up) Could you all gather in the meeting room please, Paul has something important to say.\r\n Tom: What is it Denise?  Is it about my fantastic sales figures again, huh?\r\n\r\n Denise: I doubt it Tom.  It sounded urgent.  I'd better bring some tea.\r\n Door closes\r\n\r\n Paul: Thank you for joining me.  Unfortunately, there has been an incident in the warehouse.  Someone has been smoking and I'm not happy, so I thought I would remind you of our health and safety procedures.\r\n\r\n Tom: Not this again!\r\n\r\n Paul: Your safety is our responsibility.  But to keep safe we must follow some simple rules.  Denise, what's the first one?\r\n\r\n Denise: (Slurps tea) If you see a fire, raise the alarm – oh and call the fire service.\r\n\r\n Tom: Yeah, you love seeing those firemen, don't you, Denise!\r\n\r\n Paul: Shhh Tom.  Maybe you could tell us the other rule?\r\n\r\n Tom: Oh yeah right.  If you hear the fire alarm, get out quick.\r\n\r\n Paul: Not exactly Tom.  I think we should walk calmly to our nearest fire exit, following the green signs, go outside and meet at the fire assembly point.\r\n\r\n Denise: Yes, and I will take a register of who is here, using my red pen (slurps tea).\r\n\r\n Paul: Do you mind not slurping Denise?\r\n\r\n Denise: This is thirsty work.\r\n\r\n Paul: Hmm.  Now is everyone clear about what to do if there is a fire alarm?\r\n\r\n Tom: It's usually a false alarm anyway.\r\n\r\n Paul: That's not the point.  Now Anna, what about smoking?\r\n\r\n Anna: No smoking on company premises.  But it wasn't me, it was Mr Ingle.\r\n\r\n All: Mr Ingle!\r\n\r\n Paul: I see, so it was Mr Ingle smoking in the warehouse.  You should have told me Anna.\r\n\r\n Anna: Sorry!\r\n\r\n Paul: Right, I'm going to have to look into this.  Back to work everyone… oh and take a biscuit with you.\r\n\r\n Narrator: So Anna's let the cat out of the bag – Mr Ingle won't be pleased – but at least she now knows what do if a fire breaks out.  Here are some of the phrases we've heard today, that can be used in an emergency:\r\nIf you see a fire, raise the alarm.\r\n Walk calmly to your nearest fire exit.\r\n Meet at the fire assembly point.\r\n No smoking on company premises.\r\n\r\n Fire alarm\r\n Tom: Sorry to interrupt Paul… but the fire alarm's going off!\r\n\r\n Denise: Don't panic anyone.  Everything will be OK.  (On phone) Jane, I'll have to call you back… yes, a bit of a panic.  Bye.  Quick, where's my red pen?\r\n\r\n Narrator: Uh-oh.  Those emergency phrases might come in useful sooner than you think.  Is this going to be the end of Tip Top Trading, will it really go up in smoke?  Find out next time.  Bye.\r\n\r\n • Listening Challenge\r\n What colour are the fire exit signs?"

You know, there are plenty of other people in the world, plenty of fish in the sea, so to speak.  Though i may think this person is amazing.  I'm obviously gonna know my best friend far better [then the girl] and i plan on being best friends with my best friends for the rest of my life.  Any girl that I'm going to date right now could end up being the one, but - maybe I'm being too realistic - she probably isn't.  So i just have to believe that if she's going to be the right one we'll end up together regardless of what happens in the next 10 years.  So if a buddy asks me \"Hey, i really like her, can you not date her?\"  I'd be like, \"Go ahead man, it's not that big of a deal.\"  I say that now until, of course, that perfect girl comes along!\""

        "text":"The Potala Palace: Tibet's greatest monumental structure\r\n Perched upon Marpo Ri hill, 130 meters above the Lhasa valley, the Potala Palace rises a further 170 meters and is the greatest monumental structure in all of Tibet.  In 637 Emperor Songtsen Gampo decided to build this palace on a hill, and the structure stood until the seventeenth century, when it was incorporated into the foundations of the greater buildings still standing today.  Construction of the present palace began in 1645 during the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama and by 1648 the Potrang Karpo, or White Palace, was completed.  The Potrang Marpo, or Red Palace, was added between 1690 and 1694;  its construction required the labors of more than 7000 workers and 1500 artists and craftsman.  The Potala Palace was only slightly damaged during the Tibetan uprising against the invading Chinese in 1959.  Unlike most other Tibetan religious structures, it was not sacked by the Red Guards during the 1960s and 1970s.  As a result, all the chapels and their artifacts are very well preserved.

English is spoken by scientists, pilots, computer experts, diplomats and tourists;  it is the language of the world!  Did you know over 50 % of all business deals are conducted in English?  And over 70% of all mail is written and addressed in English?  It is the official or co-official language of over 45 countries and futhermore, it is spoken extensively in other countries where it has no official status.  It is perhaps, therefore, not surprising that in recent years we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of students opting to study abroad.  In the future this will cement the role that English plays in the cultural, political or economic life of many countries around the world from Australia to Zambia."

Mankind has finally realised the threat of increasing population and has faced the fact that something must be done.  The food-supply increase lags considerably behind the immense growth of population.  Besides conditions for crops growth steadily become worse due to numerous kinds of environmental pollution.  And worst of all, today's man consistently contributes to his own deadly crisis.  We have got too many cars, too many factories, too much wastes and carbon dioxide, too little water and food deficiency - all that can be easily traced to abundant human population.  That is why many western scientists say that our world is going through an ecological crisis which will mean the gradual destruction of the human race.  Our scientists are not that pessimistic, although they do think that man's increased influence on the planet is posing a growing threat to the biosphere.  It is not too late to forestall what could be drastic and irreversible changes in the environment and ensure that the world will be a healthy place for the present and future generations to live in."
