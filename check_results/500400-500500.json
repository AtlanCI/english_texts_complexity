        "text":" I was falling.\r\n Then nothing.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-TWO Taborlin the Great\r\n I woke.  I was warm and dry.  It was dark.\r\n I heard a familiar voice questioning.  Marten’s voice, “It was all him.  He did it.”\r\n Questioning.\r\n “I won’t never say, Den.  I swear to God I won’t.  I don’t want to think of it.  Get him to tell you if you want.”\r\n Questioning.\r\n “You’d know if you’d seen.  Then you wouldn’t want to know no more.  Don’t cross him.  I’ve seen him angry.  That’s all I’ll say.  Don’t cross him.”\r\n Questioning.\r\n “Leave off, Den.  He was killing them one by one.  Then he went a little crazy.  He . . .  No.  All I’ll say is this.  I think he called the lighting down.  Like God himself.”\r\n Like Taborlin the Great, I thought.  And smiled.  And slept.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-THREE Mercenaries All\r\n After fourteen hours of sleep I was fit as a fiddle.  My companions seemed surprised by this, as they’d found me unconscious, cold to the touch, and covered in blood.  They had stripped me, rubbed my limbs a bit, then rolled me in blankets and put me inside the bandits’ single surviving tent.  The other five had been either burned, buried, or lost when a great white pillar of lightning blasted the tall oak that stood at the center of the bandits’ camp.\r\n The next day was overcast but blessedly free of rain.  First we tended to our hurts.  Hespe had taken an arrow in the leg when the sentry had surprised them.  Dedan had a deep gash along one of his shoulders, which was fairly lucky, considering he’d rushed the sentry bare-handed.  When I asked him about it, he said he simply hadn’t had time to draw his sword.\r\n Marten had an angry red lump on his forehead above one eyebrow, either from when I had kicked him over or dragged him around.  It was tender to the touch, but he claimed he had gotten worse a dozen times in tavern brawls.\r\n After I recovered from the chills I was fine.  I could tell my companions were surprised by my sudden return from the doors of death and decided to leave them to their amazement.  A little mystery wouldn’t hurt my reputation.\r\n I bandaged the ragged cut where the arrow had grazed my shoulder and tended to a few bruises and scrapes I didn’t remember receiving.  I also had the long, shallow cut I had made on the top of my arm, but it was barely worth stitches.\r\n Tempi was unhurt, unruffled, unreadable.\r\n Our second order of business was to tend to the dead.  While I had been unconscious the rest of the group had pulled most of the burned, lifeless bodies to one side of the clearing.  They tallied thus:\r\nOne sentry, killed by Dedan.\r\n Two who had surprised Tempi in the forest.\r\n Three who had survived the lightning and tried to escape.  Marten brought one down, Tempi claimed the other two.\r\n Seventeen burned, broken, or otherwise ravaged by the lightning.  Of those, eight had been dead, or wounded unto death, beforehand.\r\n We found tracks of one sentry who had watched the whole incident from the northeast piece of the ridge.  His tracks were a day old before we found them, and none of us felt the slightest desire to hunt him down.  Dedan pointed out he might be worth more alive if he spread word of this spectacular defeat to others who were thinking of banditry as a way of life.  For once we agreed on something.\r\n The leader’s body was not among those gathered.  The large tent he had ducked into had been crushed beneath large sections of the huge oak’s blasted trunk.  Having more than enough to occupy us for the time being, we left his remains alone for now.\r\n"

        "text":" If there is no compelling narrative of what the market is and how it can scale, you haven’t yet found or created the right market.  A plan to scale is crucial.  A classic example is the Edison Gower-Bell Telephone Company.  Alexander Graham Bell developed the telephone, and with it, a new market.  Initially, that market was very small;  only a few people were involved in it.  It was very easy to be the only one doing things in such a small, early market.  They expanded.  They kept expanding.  The market became durable.  Network effects began to operate.  It quickly became very hard for others to break in.\r\n\r\n The best kind of business is thus one where you can tell a compelling story about the future.  The stories will all be different, but they take the same form: find a small target market, become the best in the world at serving it, take over immediately adjacent markets, widen the aperture of what you’re doing, and capture more and more.  Once the operation is quite large, some combination of network effects, technology, scale advantages, or even brand should make it very hard for others to follow.  That is the recipe for building valuable businesses.\r\n\r\n Probably every single tech company ever has fit some version of this pattern.  Of course, putting together a completely accurate narrative of your company’s future requires nothing less than figuring out the entire future of the world, which isn’t likely to happen.  But not being able to get the future exactly right doesn’t mean you don’t have to think about it.  And the more you think about it, the better your narrative and better your chances of building a valuable company.\r\n\r\n C.  Some Examples \r\n\r\n Amazon started very small.  Initially, it was just going to be an online bookstore.  Granted, becoming the best bookstore in the world, i.e. having all books in catalogue, is not a trivial thing to do.  But the scale was very manageable.  What is amazing about Amazon was that and how they were able to gradually scale from bookstore to the world’s general store.  This was part of the founding vision from the outset.  The Amazon name was brilliant;  the incredible diversity of life in the Amazon reflected the initial goal of cataloging every book in the world.  But the elasticity in the name let it scale seamlessly.  At a different scale, the Amazon’s diversity also stood for every thing in the world.\r\n\r\n eBay also started small.  The idea was to build a platform and prepare for the unexpected.  The first unexpected thing was the popularity of Pez dispensers.  eBay became the single place where people who were into collecting all the various kinds of Pez dispensers could get them.  Then came beanie babies.  eBay soon became the only place in world where you could quickly get any particular beanie baby you wanted.  Creating a marketplace for auctions lent itself to natural monopoly.  Marketplaces are full of buyers and sellers.  If you’re buying, you go where the most sellers are.  And if you’re selling, you go to where the buyers are.  This is why most companies list on just one stock exchange;  to create liquidity, all buyers and sellers should be concentrated in the same place.  And eBay was able to expand its marketplace to cover a surprisingly large number of verticals.\r\n\r\n But eBay ran into problems in 2004, when it became apparent that that auction model didn’t extend well to everything.  That core monopoly business turned out to be an auction marketplace for somewhat unique products, like coins and stamps, for which there was intense demand but limited supply.  The auction model was much less successful for commodity-like products, which companies like Amazon, Overstock, and Buy.com dealt in.  eBay still turned out to be a great monopoly business.  It’s just a smaller one than people thought it would be in 2004.\r\n\r\n LinkedIn has 61 million users in the U.S. and 150 million worldwide.  The idea was that it would be a network for everyone.  The reality is that it’s largely just used for headhunting.  Some have proposed a unique long/short strategy utilizing that insight: short the companies where lots of people are joining LinkedIn to post résumés and look for jobs, and go long the companies who are suspiciously quiet on LinkedIn.  The big question about LinkedIn is whether the business network is the same as the social network.  LinkedIn’s narrative is that the business network is fundamentally discrete.  If that’s true, it will probably own that market for a long time.\r\n\r\n Twitter is a classic example of starting with a small, niche product.  The idea was simply that anyone can become a microbroadcaster.  It works even if you just do it with a small number of people.  But as it scales you basically build a new media distribution center.  The big question about Twitter is whether it will ever make any money.  That’s not an easy question to answer.   But if you ask the future tech questions — Do you have a technological advantage?  Do you have a moat?  Can people replicate this?  — Twitter seems safe.  If Twitter’s market is the market for sending messages of 140 characters or less, it would be incredibly hard to replicate it.   Sure, you can copy it.  But you can’t replicate it.  Indeed, it’s almost impossible to imagine a technological future where you can compete with Twitter.   Move to 141 characters and you break SMS compatibility.  Go down to 139 and you’re just missing a character.   So while monetization is an open question, Twitter’s robustness and durability are hard to beat.\r\n\r\n Zynga is another interesting case.  Mark Pincus has wisely said that, “Not having clear goal at outset leads to death by a thousand compromises.”  Zynga executed very well from the beginning.  They started doing social games like Farmville.   They aggressively copied what worked, scaled, figured out how to monetize these games — how to get enough users to pay for in-game perks — better than anyone else did.  Their success with monetization drove the viral loop and allowed them to get more customers quickly.\r\n\r\n The question about Zynga is how durable it is.  Is it a creative or non-creative business?  Zynga wants the narrative to be that it’s not a creative or a design company.  If it is, the problem is that coming up with new great games is hard.  Zynga would basically just be game version of a Hollywood studio whose fortunes can rise or fall with the seasons.  Instead, Zynga wants the narrative to be about hardcore psychometric sauce.  It’s a better company if it’s figured out how psychological and mathematical laws give it permanent monopoly advantages.  Zynga wants, perhaps needs, to be able to truthfully say, “we know how to make people buy more sheep, and therefore we are a permanent monopoly.” \r\n\r\n Groupon also started small and scaled up aggressively.  The questions for Groupon is what is the relevant market and how can they own it.  Groupon insists it’s a brand;  it’s penetrated to all these cities, and people look to it, not others, for deals.  The anti-Groupon angle is that it has no proprietary technology and no network effects.  If the branding isn’t as strong as Groupon says it is, it will face lots of challenges in the long term.\r\n\r\n All these companies are different, but the pattern is the same: start with a small, specific market, scale up, and always have an account of how robust you are going forward.  The best way to fail is to invert this recipe by starting big and shrinking.  Pets.com, Webvan, and Kozmo.com made this mistake.  There are many modes of failure.  But not being honest about objective market conditions is a sort of failure paradigm.  You can’t succeed by believing your own rhetoric over reality except by luck.\r\n\r\n V. Tech Frontiers\r\n\r\n There is always some room to operate in existing markets.  Instead of creating a new market, you could “disrupt” existing industries.  But the disruptive tech story is possibly overdone.  Disruptive companies tend not to succeed.  Disruptive kids get sent to principal’s office.  Look at Napster.  Napster was certainly disruptive…probably too disruptive.  It broke too many rules and people weren’t ready for it.  Take the name itself: Napster.  It sounds disruptive.  But what kinds of things can one “nap”?  Music and kids.  Yikes.  Much better than to disrupt is to find a frontier and go for it.\r\n\r\n But where is the frontier in technology?  How should we begin to think about it?  Here is one possible framework.  Picture the world as being covered by ponds, lakes, and oceans.  You’re in a boat, in a body of water.  But it’s extremely foggy, so you don’t know how far it is to the other side.  You don’t know whether you’re in a pond, a lake, or an ocean.\r\n\r\n If you’re in a pond, you might expect the crossing to take about an hour.  So if you’ve been out a whole day, you’re either in a lake or an ocean.  If you’ve been out for a year, you’re crossing an ocean.  The longer journey, the longer your expected remaining journey.  It’s true that you’re getting closer to reaching the other side as time goes on.  But here, time passing is also indicative that you still have quite a ways to go.\r\n\r\n So where are the places where technology is happening?  Where is there room for the journey to continue?   The frontier is a promising place, but also a very uncertain one.  You can imagine a tech market where nothing is happening for a long time, things suddenly start to happen, and then it all stops.  The tech frontier is temporal, not geographical.  It’s when things are happening.\r\n\r\n Consider the automotive industry.  Trying to build a car company in the 19th century was a bad idea.  It was too early.  But it’s far too late to build a traditional car company today.  Car companies — some 300 of them, a few of which are still around — were built in 20th century.  The time to build a car company was the time when car technology was being created — not before, and not after.\r\n\r\n We should ask ourselves whether the right time to enter a tech industry is early on, as conventional wisdom suggests.  The best time to enter may be much later than that.  It can’t be too late, since you still need room to do something.  But you want to enter the field when you can make the last great development, after which the drawbridge goes up and you have permanent capture.  You want to pick the right time, go long on tech, succeed, and then short tech.\r\n\r\n Microsoft is probably the last operating system company.  It was also an early one, but there’s a sense in which it will be the last as well.  Google, the narrative goes, is the last search engine company;  it wrought a quantum improvement in search with its shift to an algorithmic approach, and that can’t be much improved on.  What about bioinformatics?  A lot seems to be happening there.  But whether it’s too early to jump in is hard to know.  The field seems very promising.  But it’s difficult to get a sense of where it will likely be in 15 or 20 years.  Since the goal is to build companies that will still be around in 2020, you want to avoid a field where things are moving too quickly.  You want to avoid being an innovative but non-profitable disk drive company from the ‘80s.\r\n\r\n Some markets are like the automotive market.  Should you start a new lithium battery company?  Probably not.  The time for that may have passed.  Innovation may be too slow.  The technology may be too set by now.\r\n\r\n But sometimes seemingly terminal markets aren’t.  Look at aerospace.  SpaceX thinks it can cut space launch costs by 70-90%.  That would be incredibly valuable.  If nothing has happened in an industry for a long time, and you come along and dramatically improve something important, chances are that no one else will come and do that again, to you. \r\n\r\n Artificial Intelligence is probably an underrated field.  People are burned out on it, largely because it has been overrated and overstated for many decades.  Few people think AI is or will soon be real at this point.  But progress is increasingly relentless.  AI performance in chess is increasing.  Computers will probably beat humans in Go in 4 or 5 years.  AI is probably a good place to look on the tech frontier.  The challenge is that no one knows how far it will go.\r\n\r\n Mobile Internet deserves some mention.  The question is whether there’s a gold rush in mobile.  An important subquestion is whether, given a gold rush, you’d rather be a gold digger or the guy selling shovels to gold diggers.  But Google and Apple are selling the shovels.  And there may not be that much gold left to find.  The worry is that the market is just too big.  Too many companies are competing.  As discussed above, there are various rhetorical tricks one can use to whittle down the market size and make any given company seem way more unique.  Maybe you can create a mobile company that owns a valuable niche.  Maybe you can find some gold.  But that’s worth being skeptical about.\r\n\r\n VI.  Frontiers and People\r\n\r\n One way to tell whether you’ve found a good frontier is to answer the question “Why should the 20th employee join your company?”  If you have a great answer, you’re on the right track.  If not, you’re not.  The problem is the question is deceptively easy sounding.\r\n\r\n So what makes for a good answer?  First, let’s put the question in context.  You must recognize that your indirect competition for good employees is companies like Google.  So the more pointed version of the question is: “Why would the 20th engineer join your company when they could go to Google instead and get more money and prestige?” \r\n\r\n The right answer has to be that you’re creating some sort of monopoly business.  Early businesses are driven by the quality of the people involved with them.  To attract the best people, you need a compelling monopoly story.  To the extent you’re competing with Google for talent, you must understand that Google is a great monopoly business.  You probably should not compete with them at their core monopoly business of search.  But in terms of hiring, you simply can’t compete with a great monopoly business unless you have a powerful narrative that has you becoming a great monopoly business too.\r\n\r\n This raises the question that we’ll discuss next week: kinds of people do you want to take with you as you head off into the frontier?"

        "text":"Relationships play a very important role in Russia.  Perhaps that partly explains their desire to work as a team.  Russian people are used to living in society and deciding their problems collectively.  And of course Russian people have their own peculiarities of communication.\r\n\r\n Russian people often treat associates with caution.  They aren’t used to trusting strangers.  But if you become a friend of a Russian he’ll do everything that he can for you.\r\n\r\n Friendship has a big significance for Russians.  They value it very much.  The nearest people for them are usually friends from the childhood and university.  They can share all their problems with such friends.  Russians are always ready to help their nearest.  They are often ready to do it notwithstanding their interests.  In addition, they don’t require any gratitude in exchange.  If you say to them “Thanks” for their help then they’ll answer you something like “That’s what friends are for”.  Betrayal is always condemned.  Having lost the trust of Russian you’ll hardly be able to get it back again.\r\n\r\n Russians usually establish family at 22-25 years.  Men sometimes get married a little later.  By the way this figure notably started to move towards older ages.  The reason is often because of education, career etc.\r\n\r\n Traditionally the man is the head of the family.  Although women often take this role.  All duties in the house are usually clearly assigned.  There is woman’s and man’s work in every house.  The woman usually cooks, washes, cleans etc.  And man repairs, twists bulbs, carries all the family on the car.  Earning money is another duty of the family father.\r\n\r\n There are usually no more than 2 children in a family.  And a family raising 3 children is considered to be have many children and gets the right to some state benefits.\r\n\r\n Parents help children selflessly.  Moreover they help them even if their sons and daughters are adults themselves.  To make this situation clearer let’s use an example.  In some countries parents provide loans to their children for education.  When those finish institute and start earning money themselves then they give back the debt to their parents.  In Russia it’s not normal.  Relatives would never treat each other so.  Such behavior here is a sign of greed.  And even of mistrust.  Both parents and children must help each other.  That is natural.  And there’s no necessity to set it in law.\r\n\r\n In Russia, people don’t like unnecessary formalities and documents.  It’s considered that close people can decide such problems without any strangers.  For that reason there are a few people in Russia who make up a marriage contract.\r\n\r\n Grandmothers often take on raising the children themselves.  Russian grandmathers sometimes live more for their grandchildren than for themselves.  This pleases them because they really love their grandsons and granddaughters and are always ready to sit with them.  This of course helps parents alot.  They get free time and can devote it to relaxation.  The only reason for concern here can be the capability for a grandmother to spoil her grandchildren.  Often she is so kind that just can’t say them no.\r\n\r\n Also there is a stereotype in Russia – a man dislikes his mother-in-law.  The same in the contrary.  It’s considered that mother-in-law never agrees with the opinion of her son-in-law.  Besides sometimes she even tries to create havoc.  There are hundreds of jokes on that topic which are popular in Russia.  Though it worth noticing that this stereotype is more likely not to work.  Usually a mother-in-law and a son-in-law have quite warm and friendly relationships.\r\n\r\n Distant relatives also get together often.  This happens on holidays for example.  Sometimes they overcome tremendous distances to meet.  It’s common to bring with them presents to house hosts.  Relatives gather at a wide table full of different meals.  Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs in the house.  And this problem is usually decided by asking the neighbours.  This is considered normal in Russia.\r\n\r\n Actually people usually know their neighbors here.  Lots of them even are friends with them.  It’s very convenient because there’s always an opportunity to ask neighbors for help.\r\n\r\n The attitude to older people is valid.  Children are told that they must help the elderly.  For example if a pastern came in to the bus it’s common here to concede her a sitting place.  And if you don’t do it then you risk getting general condemnation.  And not only mental but also a verbal one.\r\n\r\n Relationships between citizens and government are interesting.  Russian people often don’t associate themselves and their government.  Moreover they don’t usually expect much good from it.  But this problem is hard to solve because historical experience, unfortunately, doesn’t completely allow country citizens to trust the government.\r\n\r\n It’s hard to say how to find a way to approach a Russian.  He just needs to feel that he can trust you and then be sure you’ve got his good attitude.  Besides don’t be surprised if a Russian doesn’t smile at you very often.  That absolutely doesn’t mean that he treats you badly.  Some people also think that you can adjust relationships with Russian if you drink a couple of vodka-glasses with him.  There’s a share of truth here.  Besides such your behavior lets him feel that you aren’t afraid to open up to him, that his company is pleasant to you and sometimes even that you respect him."

        "text":"In Russia weddings have always been a tremendous event where a large amount of people was invited.  There are special traditions and customs connected with a wedding and such preparation has existed here for centuries.  Lots of them are well kept here nowadays.\r\n\r\n Preparing for a wedding takes a long time.  All the nearest relatives take part in this event.  Guests are sent invitations.  If the celebration is not taking place in a restaurant then the women cook different meals.  The cars in which the guests of the wedding will travel are decorated with tapes, flowers and balloons.  No doubt the most beautiful one must be the car for bride and groom.  Also before the wedding it’s important to choose two witnesses.  One of them must be a man and the other one – a girl.  By the way groom usually chooses the man, and the bride chooses a girl to be witnesses.  These are as a rule best friends, brothers or sisters of the young couple.\r\n\r\n Alot of attention is payed to the clothes of a groom and a bride.  In Russia the groom is usually wearing strict black suit and white shirt.  The dress of a bride is to the contrary traditionally of white color.  There is a veil on her head.  Besides the groom mustn’t see the bride in her dress before the wedding.  In Russia it’s considered to be a bad sign.\r\n\r\n An important custom is the buy-out of bride.  The groom and his friends must come to the house of the bride.  Guests from the girl's side are waiting for them here.  The guy must pass several trials to see and to take his bride away.  For example he is asked to make compliments to the bride.  Or they can check how well he knows her asking different questions about her.  If he doesn’t know the answer to the question or is mistaken then he must pay.\r\n\r\n The groom is given the bride in the end.  When a young couple goes to street parents sprinkle them with rice or coins.  This is done for future prosperity and well-being of newly-married couple.\r\n\r\n After that future spouses sit into the car and go to the wedding palace.  Guests follow them.  Decorated cars go on the streets in column.  During the travel they’re certainly signaling so that all the associates paid attention to them and knew about the holiday\r\n\r\n The official part of the wedding takes place in a registry office.  It's rarer for couples to arrange wedding ceremony at a church.  During the wedding the groom and bride exchange rings symbolizing their love and devotion to each other.\r\n\r\n After the official registration a newly-married couple goes to the trip through the city with guests.  They stay at mostly important monuments and sightseeing.  Besides there is a tradition that the groom must carry bride on his hands through all the bridges in the city.  Of course it is rarely executed but at least one bridge is necessary.  As a rule at each staying guests say toasts for the young family.\r\n\r\n At this time the parents of a groom go home.  After the city trip all the others also come here.  The grooms parents meet a newly-married couple with bread and salt in front of the house entry.  They wish the new family happy life together.  After that they treat the groom and bride with bread and salt.  It’s considered that the host in the house will be that of them who breaks off or bites off a bigger piece of bread.\r\n\r\n Then guests go to a place where the celebration will take place.  Here a magnificent table is waiting for them.  The groom and bride sit at it first.  By the way bride sits right of teh groom, and the groom's parents are right to bride.  After that the other people take their places, and the celebratory dinner starts.  It is accompanied with numerous toasts for happiness, health and well-being for the groom and bride.\r\n\r\n Besides if you are at a Russian wedding don’t be surprised when you’ll quite often hear here guest shouts “Bitterly!”  Sometimes even too often.  Don’t think it far doesn’t speak that the food isn’t tasty.  In fact when guests shout “Bitterly!”  that means that the groom and bride must kiss each other.  By the way sometimes you can also hear “Sweet!”  And this moment witnesses must kiss each other.\r\n\r\n Guests give presents to newly-married couple.  Usually wedding presents are practical.  Lots of guests even give money.  Also different kinds of home appliances are popular here.\r\n\r\n Also there is a tamada every wedding – host or toastmaster in English.  The tamada is a person who leads a wedding and tries to make it cheerful and memorable.  He carries competitions with the participation of the newly-married couple, witnesses, the parents of the bridegroom and the bride and other guests.  Often the future of the couple is defined by the results of such competitions.  For example they find out who and what duties will carry out.  Also often they bear two trays.  Guests are offered to put money on one of them depending on whose birth they allow from the young family – a boy or a girl.  After all who wanted have voted this way tamada counts money for a boy and for a girl.  It’s considered that that of them will be born for whom the assembled sum is bigger.  By the way the first piece of wedding cake is also supplied from the auction.  Sometimes tamada sings.  Actually music is present at Russian weddings.  After the dinner quests always dance.\r\n\r\n Usually weddings take part on Saturday.  But celebrating lasts 2 days.  On Sunday bride isn’t wearing her white dress.  This day guests gather again together and continue having fun.  There aren’t any special traditions on Monday."

        "text":" While America's military strength is important, let me add here that I've always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might.  The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one;  at root, it is a test of moral will and faith.\r\n\r\n Whittaker Chambers, the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our time, the Hiss-Chambers case, wrote that the crisis of the Western World exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God, the degree to which it collaborates in communism's attempt to make man stand alone without God.  And then he said, for Marxism-Leninism is actually the second oldest faith, first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation, \"Ye shall be as gods.\"\r\n\r\n The Western world can answer this challenge, he wrote, \"but only provided that its faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as communism's faith in Man.\"\r\n\r\n I believe we shall rise to the challenge.  I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written.  I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual.  And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man.  For in the words of Isaiah: \"He giveth power to the faint;  and to them that have no might He increased strength But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;  they shall mount up with wings as eagles;  they shall run, and not be weary.\"\r\n\r\n Yes, change your world.  One of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Paine, said, \"We have it within our power to begin the world over again.\"  We can do it, doing together what no one church could do by itself.\r\n\r\n God bless you, and thank you very much."

        "text":"Model-View-Controller\r\n\r\n The Model-View-Controller design pattern (MVC) is quite old.  Variations of it have been around at least since the early days of Smalltalk.  It is a high-level pattern in that it concerns itself with the global architecture of an application and classifies objects according to the general roles they play in an application.  It is also a compound pattern in that it comprises several, more elemental patterns.\r\n\r\n Object-oriented programs benefit in several ways by adapting the MVC design pattern for their designs.  Many objects in these programs tend to be more reusable and their interfaces tend to be better defined.  The programs overall are more adaptable to changing requirements — in other words, they are more easily extensible than programs that are not based on MVC.  Moreover, many technologies and architectures in Cocoa — such as bindings, the document architecture, and scriptability — are based on MVC and require that your custom objects play one of the roles defined by MVC.\r\n\r\n Roles and Relationships of MVC Objects\r\n\r\n The MVC design pattern considers there to be three types of objects: model objects, view objects, and controller objects.  The MVC pattern defines the roles that these types of objects play in the application and their lines of communication.  When designing an application, a major step is choosing — or creating custom classes for — objects that fall into one of these three groups.  Each of the three types of objects is separated from the others by abstract boundaries and communicates with objects of the other types across those boundaries.\r\n\r\n Model Objects Encapsulate Data and Basic Behaviors\r\n Model objects represent special knowledge and expertise.  They hold an application’s data and define the logic that manipulates that data.  A well-designed MVC application has all its important data encapsulated in model objects.  Any data that is part of the persistent state of the application (whether that persistent state is stored in files or databases) should reside in the model objects once the data is loaded into the application.  Because they represent knowledge and expertise related to a specific problem domain, they tend to be reusable.\r\n\r\n Ideally, a model object has no explicit connection to the user interface used to present and edit it.  For example, if you have a model object that represents a person (say you are writing an address book), you might want to store a birthdate.  That’s a good thing to store in your Person model object.  However, storing a date format string or other information on how that date is to be presented is probably better off somewhere else.\r\n\r\n In practice, this separation is not always the best thing, and there is some room for flexibility here, but in general a model object should not be concerned with interface and presentation issues.  One example where a bit of an exception is reasonable is a drawing application that has model objects that represent the graphics displayed.  It makes sense for the graphic objects to know how to draw themselves because the main reason for their existence is to define a visual thing.  But even in this case, the graphic objects should not rely on living in a particular view or any view at all, and they should not be in charge of knowing when to draw themselves.  They should be asked to draw themselves by the view object that wants to present them.\r\n\r\n View Objects Present Information to the User\r\n A view object knows how to display, and might allow users to edit, the data from the application’s model.  The view should not be responsible for storing the data it is displaying.  (This does not mean the view never actually stores data it’s displaying, of course.  A view can cache data or do similar tricks for performance reasons).  A view object can be in charge of displaying just one part of a model object, or a whole model object, or even many different model objects.  Views come in many different varieties.\r\n\r\n View objects tend to be reusable and configurable, and they provide consistency between applications.  In Cocoa, the AppKit framework defines a large number of view objects and provides many of them in the Interface Builder library.  By reusing the AppKit’s view objects, such as NSButton objects, you guarantee that buttons in your application behave just like buttons in any other Cocoa application, assuring a high level of consistency in appearance and behavior across applications.\r\n\r\n A view should ensure it is displaying the model correctly.  Consequently, it usually needs to know about changes to the model.  Because model objects should not be tied to specific view objects, they need a generic way of indicating that they have changed.\r\n\r\n Controller Objects Tie the Model to the View\r\n A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application's view objects and its model objects.  Controllers are often in charge of making sure the views have access to the model objects they need to display and act as the conduit through which views learn about changes to the model.  Controller objects can also perform set-up and coordinating tasks for an application and manage the life cycles of other objects.\r\n\r\n In a typical Cocoa MVC design, when users enter a value or indicate a choice through a view object, that value or choice is communicated to a controller object.  The controller object might interpret the user input in some application-specific way and then either may tell a model object what to do with this input — for example, \"add a new value\" or \"delete the current record\" — or it may have the model object reflect a changed value in one of its properties.  Based on this same user input, some controller objects might also tell a view object to change an aspect of its appearance or behavior, such as telling a button to disable itself.  Conversely, when a model object changes — say, a new data source is accessed — the model object usually communicates that change to a controller object, which then requests one or more view objects to update themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\n Controller objects can be either reusable or nonreusable, depending on their general type.  “Types of Cocoa Controller Objects” describes the different types of controller objects in Cocoa.\r\n\r\n Combining Roles\r\n One can merge the MVC roles played by an object, making an object, for example, fulfill both the controller and view roles — in which case, it would be called a view controller.  In the same way, you can also have model-controller objects.  For some applications, combining roles like this is an acceptable design.\r\n\r\n A model controller is a controller that concerns itself mostly with the model layer.  It “owns” the model;  its primary responsibilities are to manage the model and communicate with view objects.  Action methods that apply to the model as a whole are typically implemented in a model controller.  The document architecture provides a number of these methods for you;  for example, an NSDocument object (which is a central part of the document architecture) automatically handles action methods related to saving files.\r\n\r\n A view controller is a controller that concerns itself mostly with the view layer.  It “owns” the interface (the views);  its primary responsibilities are to manage the interface and communicate with the model.  Action methods concerned with data displayed in a view are typically implemented in a view controller.  An NSWindowController object (also part of the document architecture) is an example of a view controller.\r\n\r\n “Design Guidelines for MVC Applications” offers some design advice concerning objects with merged MVC roles.\r\n\r\n Further Reading: Document-Based Applications Overview discusses the distinction between a model controller and a view controller from another perspective.\r\n Types of Cocoa Controller Objects\r\n\r\n “Controller Objects Tie the Model to the View” sketches the abstract outline of a controller object, but in practice the picture is far more complex.  In Cocoa there are two general kinds of controller objects: mediating controllers and coordinating controllers.  Each kind of controller object is associated with a different set of classes and each provides a different range of behaviors.\r\n\r\n A mediating controller is typically an object that inherits from the NSControllerclass.  Mediating controller objects are used in the Cocoa bindings technology.  They facilitate — or mediate — the flow of data between view objects and model objects.\r\n\r\n iOS Note: AppKit implements the NSController class and its subclasses.  These classes and the bindings technology are not available in iOS.\r\n Mediating controllers are typically ready-made objects that you drag from the Interface Builder library.  You can configure these objects to establish the bindings between properties of view objects and properties of the controller object, and then between those controller properties and specific properties of a model object.  As a result, when users change a value displayed in a view object, the new value is automatically communicated to a model object for storage — via the mediating controller;  and when a property of a model changes its value, that change is communicated to a view for display.  The abstract NSController class and its concrete subclasses — NSObjectController, NSArrayController, NSUserDefaultsController, and NSTreeController — provide supporting features such as the ability to commit and discard changes and the management of selections and placeholder values.\r\n\r\n A coordinating controller is typically an NSWindowController or NSDocumentControllerobject (available only in AppKit), or an instance of a custom subclass of NSObject.  Its role in an application is to oversee — or coordinate — the functioning of the entire application or of part of the application, such as the objects unarchived from a nib file.  A coordinating controller provides services such as:\r\n\r\nResponding to delegation messages and observing notifications\r\n Responding to action messages\r\n Managing the life cycle of owned objects (for example, releasing them at the proper time)\r\n Establishing connections between objects and performing other set-up tasks\r\n NSWindowController and NSDocumentController are classes that are part of the Cocoa architecture for document-based applications.  Instances of these classes provide default implementations for several of the services listed above, and you can create subclasses of them to implement more application-specific behavior.  You can even use NSWindowController objects to manage windows in an application that is not based on the document architecture.\r\n\r\n A coordinating controller frequently owns the objects archived in a nib file.  As File’s Owner, the coordinating controller is external to the objects in the nib file and manages those objects.  These owned objects include mediating controllers as well as window objects and view objects.  See “MVC as a Compound Design Pattern” for more on coordinating controllers as File's Owner.\r\n\r\n Instances of custom NSObject subclasses can be entirely suitable as coordinating controllers.  These kinds of controller objects combine both mediating and coordinating functions.  For their mediating behavior, they make use of mechanisms such as target-action, outlets, delegation, and notifications to facilitate the movement of data between view objects and model objects.  They tend to contain a lot of glue code and, because that code is exclusively application-specific, they are the least reusable kind of object in an application.\r\n\r\n Further Reading: For more on the Cocoa bindings technology, see Cocoa Bindings Programming Topics.\r\n MVC as a Compound Design Pattern\r\n\r\n Model-View-Controller is a design pattern that is composed of several more basic design patterns.  These basic patterns work together to define the functional separation and paths of communication that are characteristic of an MVC application.  However, the traditional notion of MVC assigns a set of basic patterns different from those that Cocoa assigns.  The difference primarily lies in the roles given to the controller and view objects of an application.\r\n\r\n In the original (Smalltalk) conception, MVC is made up of the Composite, Strategy, and Observer patterns.\r\n\r\n Composite — The view objects in an application are actually a composite of nested views that work together in a coordinated fashion (that is, the view hierarchy).  These display components range from a window to compound views, such as a table view, to individual views, such as buttons.  User input and display can take place at any level of the composite structure.\r\n Strategy — A controller object implements the strategy for one or more view objects.  The view object confines itself to maintaining its visual aspects, and it delegates to the controller all decisions about the application-specific meaning of the interface behavior.\r\n Observer — A model object keeps interested objects in an application — usually view objects — advised of changes in its state.\r\n The traditional way the Composite, Strategy, and Observer patterns work together is depicted by Figure 7-1: The user manipulates a view at some level of the composite structure and, as a result, an event is generated.  A controller object receives the event and interprets it in an application-specific way — that is, it applies a strategy.  This strategy can be to request (via message) a model object to change its state or to request a view object (at some level of the composite structure) to change its behavior or appearance.  The model object, in turn, notifies all objects who have registered as observers when its state changes;  if the observer is a view object, it may update its appearance accordingly.\r\n\r\n Figure 7-1  Traditional version of MVC as a compound pattern\r\n\r\n The Cocoa version of MVC as a compound pattern has some similarities to the traditional version, and in fact it is quite possible to construct a working application based on the diagram in Figure 7-1.  By using the bindings technology, you can easily create a Cocoa MVC application whose views directly observe model objects to receive notifications of state changes.  However, there is a theoretical problem with this design.  View objects and model objects should be the most reusable objects in an application.  View objects represent the \"look and feel\" of an operating system and the applications that system supports;  consistency in appearance and behavior is essential, and that requires highly reusable objects.  Model objects by definition encapsulate the data associated with a problem domain and perform operations on that data.  Design-wise, it's best to keep model and view objects separate from each other, because that enhances their reusability.\r\n\r\n In most Cocoa applications, notifications of state changes in model objects are communicated to view objects through controller objects.  Figure 7-2 shows this different configuration, which appears much cleaner despite the involvement of two more basic design patterns.\r\n\r\n Figure 7-2  Cocoa version of MVC as a compound design pattern\r\n\r\n The controller object in this compound design pattern incorporates the Mediator pattern as well as the Strategy pattern;  it mediates the flow of data between model and view objects in both directions.  Changes in model state are communicated to view objects through the controller objects of an application.  In addition, view objects incorporate the Command pattern through their implementation of the target-action mechanism.\r\n\r\n Note: The target-action mechanism, which enables view objects to communicate user input and choices, can be implemented in both coordinating and mediating controller objects.  However, the design of the mechanism differs in each controller type.  For coordinating controllers, you connect the view object to its target (the controller object) in Interface Builder and specify an action selector that must conform to a certain signature.  Coordinating controllers, by virtue of being delegates of windows and the global application object, can also be in the responder chain.  The bindings mechanism used by mediating controllers also connects view objects to targets and allows action signatures with a variable number of parameters of arbitrary types.  Mediating controllers, however, aren’t in the responder chain.\r\n There are practical reasons as well as theoretical ones for the revised compound design pattern depicted in Figure 7-2, especially when it comes to the Mediator design pattern.  Mediating controllers derive from concrete subclasses of NSController, and these classes, besides implementing the Mediator pattern, offer many features that applications should take advantage of, such as the management of selections and placeholder values.  And if you opt not to use the bindings technology, your view object could use a mechanism such as the Cocoa notification center to receive notifications from a model object.  But this would require you to create a custom view subclass to add the knowledge of the notifications posted by the model object.\r\n\r\n In a well-designed Cocoa MVC application, coordinating controller objects often own mediating controllers, which are archived in nib files.  Figure 7-3 shows the relationships between the two types of controller objects.\r\n\r\n Figure 7-3  Coordinating controller as the owner of a nib file\r\n\r\n Design Guidelines for MVC Applications\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Rather than try to dig twenty-three graves, or even a mass grave large enough for twenty-three bodies, we built a pyre and kindled it while the surrounding forest was still wet with rain.  I used my skills to ensure it burned hot and hard.\r\n But there was one other: the sentry Marten had shot and I had put to use.  While my companions were busy collecting wood for the pyre I went over the south side of the ridge and found where Tempi had hidden him away, covered with a fir branch.\r\n I looked at the body for a long time before I carried it away to the south.  I found a quiet place under a willow and built a cairn of stones.  Then I crept into the underbrush and was quietly, violently sick.\r\n\r\n The lightning?  Well, the lightning is difficult to explain.  A storm overhead.  A galvanic binding with two similar arrows.  An attempt to ground the tree more strongly than any lightning rod.  Honestly, I don’t know if I can take credit for the lightning striking when and where it did.  But as far as stories go, I called the lightning and it came.\r\n From the stories the others told, when the lightning struck it wasn’t a single startling bolt, but several in quick succession.  Dedan described it as “a pillar of white fire,” and said it shook the ground hard enough to knock him off his feet.\r\n Regardless of why, the towering oak was reduced to a charred stump about the height of a greystone.  Huge pieces of it lay scattered about.  Smaller trees and shrubs had caught fire and been doused by the rain.  Most of the long planks the bandits had used for their fortifications had exploded into pieces no bigger than the tip of your finger or burned to charcoal.  Streaking out from the base of the tree were great tracks of churned-up earth, making the clearing look as if it had been plowed by a madman or raked by the claws of some huge beast.\r\n Despite this, we stayed at the bandit’s camp for three days following our victory.  The stream provided easy water, and what remained of the bandits’ provisions were superior to our own.  What’s more, after we salvaged some lumber and canvas, each of us had the luxury of a tent or lean-to.\r\n With our job completed, the tensions plaguing our group faded.  The rain stopped, and we didn’t need to be bashful about our fires anymore, and as a result Marten’s cough was improving.  Dedan and Hespe were civil to each other, and Dedan stopped about three-quarters of his incessant jackassery toward me.\r\n But despite the relief at our job being done, things weren’t entirely comfortable.  There were no stories at night, and Marten distanced himself from me whenever he could.  I could hardly blame him, considering what he had seen.\r\n With that in mind, I took the first chance I had to privately destroy the wax mommets I had made.  I had no use for them now, and I feared what might happen if one of my companions discovered them in my travelsack.\r\n Tempi made no comment on what I’d done with the bandit’s body, and from what I could tell, he didn’t seem to hold it against me.  Looking back, I realize how little I truly understood the Adem.  But at the time, all I noticed was that Tempi spent less time helping me practice the Ketan, and more time practicing our language and discussing the ever-confusing concept of the Lethani.\r\n We fetched our equipment from our previous camp on the second day.  I was relieved to have my lute back, and doubly glad to find Denna’s marvelous case had stayed dry and tight despite the endless rain.\r\n And, since we were no longer slinking about, I played.  For a solid day I did little else.  It had been nearly a month since I had made any music, and I’d missed it more than you can imagine.\r\n At first I thought Tempi didn’t care for my music.  Aside from the fact that I’d somehow insulted him by singing early on, he always left camp when I brought out my lute.  Then I began to catch glimpses of him watching me, though always from a distance and usually at least partly hidden from sight.  Once I knew to look for him, I discovered he was always listening while I played.  Wide-eyed as an owl.  Motionless as a stone.\r\n On the third day, Hespe decided her leg could stand a little walking.  So we had to decide what was going to come with us, and what would get left behind.\r\n It wasn’t going to be as difficult as it might have been.  Most of the bandits’ equipment had been destroyed by the lightning, the falling tree, or exposure to the storm.  But there were still valuables to be salvaged from the ruined camp.\r\n We had been prevented from making a good search of the leader’s tent, as it had been crushed beneath one of the huge branches of the fallen oak.  Over two feet thick, the fallen limb was larger than most trees in its own right.  However, on the third day we finally managed to hatchet enough of it away so we could roll it off the wreckage of the tent.\r\n I was anxious to get a closer look at the leader’s body, as something about him had been nagging my memory ever since I saw him step from the tent.  And, in a more worldly vein, I knew his chain mail was worth at least a dozen talents.\r\n But we didn’t find any sign of the leader at all.  It gave us a bit of a puzzle.  Marten had only found one set of tracks leading away from the camp, those of the escaped sentry.  None of us could guess where the leader had gone.\r\n To me it was a puzzle and an annoyance, as I had been wanting to get a clearer look at his face.  Dedan and Hespe believed he’d simply escaped in the chaos following the lighting, maybe using the stream to avoid leaving tracks.\r\n Marten, however, grew distinctly uneasy when we didn’t find his body.  He murmured something about demons and refused to go near the wreckage.  I thought he was being a superstitious fool, but I won’t deny that I found the missing body more than slightly unnerving as well.\r\n Inside the ruined tent we found a table, a cot, a desk, and a pair of chairs, all shattered and useless.  In the ruined desk there were some papers I would have given a good deal to read, but they had spent too long in the wet, and the ink had run.  There was also a heavy hardwood box slightly smaller than a loaf of bread.  Alveron’s family crest was enameled on the cover, and it was locked tight.\r\n Both Hespe and Marten admitted they had a little skill at opening locks, and, since I was curious about what was inside, I let them have a go so long as they didn’t damage the lock.  Each of them took a long turn at it, but neither met with any success.\r\n After about twenty minutes of careful fiddling, Marten threw up his hands.  “I can’t find the trick for it,” he said as he stretched, pressing his hands against the small of his back.\r\n “I might as well have a try myself,” I said.  I’d hoped one of them would trick it open.  Picking locks is not the sort of skill an arcanist should pride himself on.  It didn’t fit with the reputation I was hoping to build for myself.\r\n “Will you now?”  Hespe said, raising an eyebrow at me.  “You really are a young Taborlin.”\r\n I thought back to the story Marten had told days before.  “Of course,” I laughed, then shouted, “Edro!”  in my best Taborlin the Great voice and struck the top of the box with my hand.\r\n The lid sprung open.\r\n I was surprised as everyone else, but I hid it better.  What had obviously happened is that one of them had actually tripped the lock, but the lid had been stuck.  Probably the wood had swollen as it lay for days in the damp.  When I’d struck it, it had simply come loose.\r\n But they didn’t know that.  From the looks on their faces you would think I had just transmuted gold in front of them.  Even Tempi raised an eyebrow.\r\n “Nice trick, Taborlin,” Hespe said, as if she weren’t sure if I were playing a joke on them.\r\n I decided to hold my tongue and slid my set of makeshift lockpicks back into the pocket of my cloak.  If I was going to be an arcanist, I might as well be a famous arcanist.\r\n Doing my best to radiate an air of solemn power, I lifted the lid and looked inside.  The first thing I saw was a thick, folded piece of paper.  I pulled it out.\r\n “What’s that?”  Dedan asked.\r\n I held it for all of them to see.  It was a careful map of the surrounding area, featuring not only an accurate depiction of the curving highway, but the locations of nearby farms and streams.  Crosson, Fenhill, and the Pennysworth Inn were marked and labeled on the western road.\r\n “What’s that?”  Dedan asked, gesturing with a thick finger to an unlabeled X deep in the forest on the south side of the road.\r\n “I think it’s this camp,” Marten said, pointing.  “Right next to that stream.”\r\n I nodded.  “If this is right, we’re closer to Crosson than I thought.  We could just head southeast from here, and save ourselves more than a day’s walking.”  I looked at Marten.  “Does that seem right to you?”\r\n “Here.  Let me see.”  I handed him the map and he looked it over.  “It looks like it,” he agreed.  “I didn’t think we had come that far south.  We’d save at least two dozen miles going that way.”\r\n “That’s no small blessing,” Hespe said, rubbing at her bandaged leg.  “That is, unless one of you gentlemen would like to carry me.”\r\n I turned my attention back to the lockbox.  It was full of tightly wrapped cloth packages.  Lifting one out, I saw the glint of gold.\r\n There was a murmur from everyone present.  I checked the rest of the small, heavy bundles and was greeted with more coins, all gold.  At a rough count, there were over two hundred royals.  While I’d never actually held one, I knew a single gold royal was worth eighty bits, almost as much as the Maer had given me to finance this entire trip.  No wonder the Maer had been eager to stop the waylaying of his tax collectors.\r\n I juggled numbers in my head, converting the contents of the box to a more familiar currency and came up with more than five hundred silver talents.  Enough money to buy a good-sized roadside inn, or an entire farmstead with all the livestock and equipage included.  With that much money you could buy yourself a minor title, a court appointment, or an officer’s position in the military.\r\n I saw everyone else making their own calculations.  “How about we share a little bit of that around?”  Dedan said without much hope.\r\n I hesitated, then reached into the box.  “Does a royal each seem fair to everyone?”\r\n Everyone was silent as I unwrapped one of the bundles.  Dedan looked at me incredulously.  “Are you serious?”\r\n I handed him a heavy coin.  “The way I see it, less scrupulous people might forget to tell Alveron about this.  Or they’d never go back to Alveron at all.  I think a royal each is a good reward for us being such honest folk.”  I tossed Marten and Hespe a bright gold coin each.\r\n “Besides,” I added, tossing a royal to Tempi.  “I was hired to find a group of bandits, not destroy a minor military encampment.”  I held up my royal.  “This is our bonus for services beyond the call of duty.”  I slid it into my pocket and patted it.  “Alveron need never know about it.”\r\n Dedan laughed and clapped me on the back.  “You’re not so much different from the rest of us after all,” he said.\r\n I returned his smile and pressed the lid of the box closed, hearing the lock click tightly into place.\r\n I didn’t mention the two other reasons for what I did.  First, I was effectively buying their loyalty.  They couldn’t help but realize how easy it would be to simply grab the box and disappear.  The thought had crossed my mind, too.  Five hundred talents would pay my way through the University for the next ten years with plenty to spare.\r\n Now, however, they were considerably richer, and they got to feel honest about it.  A heavy piece of gold would keep their minds off the money I was carrying.  Though I still planned on sleeping with the locked box under my pillow at night.\r\n Second, I could use the money.  Both the royal I had tucked openly into my pocket, and the other three I’d palmed when handing out coins to the others.  As I said, Alveron would never know the difference, and four royals would cover a full term’s tuition at the University.\r\n\r\n After I secured the Maer’s lockbox in the bottom of my travelsack, each of us decided what we would scavenge from the bandits’ equipment.\r\n The tents we left for the same reason we hadn’t brought our own in the first place.  They were too bulky to carry.  We took as much of their food as we could stow, knowing the more we carried, the less we would have to buy.\r\n I decided to take one of the bandits’ swords.  I wouldn’t have wasted the money to buy one, since I didn’t know how to use it, but if they were free for the taking. . . .\r\n As I was looking over the assorted weapons, Tempi came over and gave a few words of advice.  After we had narrowed my options to two swords, Tempi finally spoke his mind.  “You cannot use a sword.”  Questioning.  Embarrassment.\r\n I got the impression that to him, the thought of someone not being able to use a sword was more than slightly shameful.  Like not knowing how to eat using a knife and fork.  “No,” I said slowly.  “But I was hoping you could show me.”\r\n Tempi stood very still and quiet.  I might have taken it for a refusal if I had not come to know him so well.  This type of stillness meant he was thinking.\r\n Pauses are a key part of Ademic conversation, so I waited patiently.  The two of us stood quietly for a minute, then two.  Then five.  Then ten.  I fought to stay still and quiet.  Perhaps this was a polite refusal.\r\n I thought myself terribly savvy, you see.  I had known Tempi for nearly a month, learned a thousand words and fifty pieces of the Adem hand-speech.  I knew the Adem were not bashful about nudity, or touching, and I was beginning to grasp the mystery that was the Lethani.\r\n Oh yes, I thought I was terribly clever.  Had I truly known anything about the Adem, I never would have dared to ask Tempi such a question.\r\n “Will you teach me that?”  He pointed across the camp to where my lute case lay, leaning against a tree.\r\n I was caught off guard by the question.  I had never tried to teach anyone how to play the lute before.  Perhaps Tempi knew this and was implying something similar about himself.  I knew he was prone to subtly layered speaking.\r\n A fair offer.  I nodded.  “I will try.”\r\n Tempi nodded and pointed to one of the swords we had been considering.  “Wear it.  But no fighting.”  With that he turned and left.  At the time I took this for his natural brevity.\r\n The scavenging continued throughout the day.  Marten took a good number of arrows and all the bowstrings he could find.  Then, after checking to see no one wanted any of them, he decided to take the four longbows that had survived the lightning.  They made an awkward bundle, but he claimed they’d be worth a heavy penny when he sold them in Crosson.\r\n Dedan grabbed a pair of boots and an armored vest nicer than the one he was wearing.  He also laid claim to a deck of cards and a set of ivory dice.\r\n Hespe took a slender set of shepherd’s pipes and tucked almost a dozen knives into the bottom of her pack with the hope of selling them later.\r\n Even Tempi found some things he fancied: a whetstone, a brass saltbox, and a pair of linen pants he took down to the stream and dyed a familiar blood-red.\r\n I took less than the rest of them.  A small knife to replace the one I’d broken and a small shaving razor with a horn handle.  I didn’t need to shave that often, but I’d gotten into the habit while in the Maer’s court.  I might have followed Hespe’s example and taken a few knives as well, but my travelsack was already unpleasantly heavy with the weight of the Maer’s lockbox.\r\n This may seem a little ghoulish, but it is simply the way of the world.  Looters become looted, while time and tide make us mercenaries all.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR Over Rock and Root\r\n We decided to trust the map we’d found and cut straight west through the forest, heading toward Crosson.  Even if we missed the town, we couldn’t help but hit the road and save ourselves long miles of walking.\r\n Hespe’s wounded leg made the going slow, and we only put six or seven miles behind us that first day.  It was during one of our many breaks that Tempi began my true instruction in the Ketan.\r\n Fool that I was, I’d assumed he had already been teaching me.  The truth was, he had merely been correcting my more horrifying mistakes because they irritated him.  Much the same way I’d be tempted to tune someone’s lute if they were playing off-key in the same room.\r\n This instruction was a different thing entirely.  We started at the beginning of the Ketan and he corrected my mistakes.  All my mistakes.  He found eighteen in the first motion alone, and there are more than a hundred motions in the Ketan.  I quickly began to have doubts about this apprenticeship.\r\n I also began to teach Tempi the lute.  I played notes as we walked, and taught him their names, then showed him some chords.  It seemed as good a place as any to begin.\r\n We hoped to make it to Crosson by noon of the next day.  But near midmorning we encountered a stretch of dreary, reeking swamp that hadn’t been marked on the map.\r\n Thus began a truly miserable day.  We had to test our footing with every step, and our progress slowed to a crawl.  At one point Dedan startled and fell, thrashing about and spattering the rest of us with brackish water.  He said he’d seen a mosquito bigger than his thumb with a sucker like a woman’s hairpin.  I suggested it might have been a sipquick.  He suggested several unpleasant, unsanitary things I could do to myself at my earliest convenience.\r\n"

        "text":"The following guidelines apply to Model-View-Controller considerations in the design of applications:\r\n\r\nAlthough you can use an instance of a custom subclass of NSObject as a mediating controller, there's no reason to go through all the work required to make it one.  Use instead one of the ready-made NSController objects designed for the Cocoa bindings technology;  that is, use an instance of NSObjectController, NSArrayController, NSUserDefaultsController, or NSTreeController — or a custom subclass of one of these concrete NSController subclasses.\r\n However, if the application is very simple and you feel more comfortable writing the glue code needed to implement mediating behavior using outlets and target-action, feel free to use an instance of a custom NSObject subclass as a mediating controller.  In a custom NSObject subclass, you can also implement a mediating controller in the NSController sense, using key-value coding, key-value observing, and the editor protocols.\r\n\r\n Although you can combine MVC roles in an object, the best overall strategy is to keep the separation between roles.  This separation enhances the reusability of objects and the extensibility of the program they're used in.  If you are going to merge MVC roles in a class, pick a predominant role for that class and then (for maintenance purposes) use categories in the same implementation file to extend the class to play other roles.\r\n A goal of a well-designed MVC application should be to use as many objects as possible that are (theoretically, at least) reusable.  In particular, view objects and model objects should be highly reusable.  (The ready-made mediating controller objects, of course, are reusable.)  Application-specific behavior is frequently concentrated as much as possible in controller objects.\r\n Although it is possible to have views directly observe models to detect changes in state, it is best not to do so.  A view object should always go through a mediating controller object to learn about changes in an model object.  The reason is two-fold:\r\nIf you use the bindings mechanism to have view objects directly observe the properties of model objects, you bypass all the advantages that NSController and its subclasses give your application: selection and placeholder management as well as the ability to commit and discard changes.\r\n If you don't use the bindings mechanism, you have to subclass an existing view class to add the ability to observe change notifications posted by a model object.\r\n Strive to limit code dependency in the classes of your application.  The greater the dependency a class has on another class, the less reusable it is.  Specific recommendations vary by the MVC roles of the two classes involved:\r\nA view class shouldn't depend on a model class (although this may be unavoidable with some custom views).\r\n A view class shouldn't have to depend on a mediating controller class.\r\n A model class shouldn't depend on anything other than other model classes.\r\n A mediating controller class shouldn’t depend on a model class (although, like views, this may be necessary if it's a custom controller class).\r\n A mediating controller class shouldn't depend on view classes or on coordinating controller classes.\r\n A coordinating controller class depends on classes of all MVC role types.\r\n If Cocoa offers an architecture that solves a programming problem, and this architecture assigns MVC roles to objects of specific types, use that architecture.  It will be much easier to put your project together if you do.  The document architecture, for example, includes an Xcode project template that configures an NSDocument object (per-nib model controller) as File's Owner.\r\n Model-View-Controller in Cocoa (Mac OS X)\r\n\r\n The Model-View-Controller design pattern is fundamental to many Cocoa mechanisms and technologies.  As a consequence, the importance of using MVC in object-oriented design goes beyond attaining greater reusability and extensibility for your own applications.  If your application is to incorporate a Cocoa technology that is MVC-based, your application will work best if its design also follows the MVC pattern.  It should be relatively painless to use these technologies if your application has a good MVC separation, but it will take more effort to use such a technology if you don’t have a good separation.\r\n\r\n Cocoa in Mac OS X includes the following architectures, mechanisms, and technologies that are based on Model-View-Controller:\r\n\r\nDocument architecture.  In this architecture, a document-based application consists of a controller object for the entire application (NSDocumentController), a controller object for each document window (NSWindowController), and an object that combines controller and model roles for each document (NSDocument).\r\n Bindings.  MVC is central to the bindings technology of Cocoa.  The concrete subclasses of the abstract NSController provide ready-made controller objects that you can configure to establish bindings between view objects and properly designed model objects.\r\n Application scriptability.  When designing an application to make it scriptable, it is essential not only that it follow the MVC design pattern but that your application’s model objects are properly designed.  Scripting commands that access application state and request application behavior should usually be sent to model objects or controller objects.\r\n Core Data.  The Core Data framework manages graphs of model objects and ensures the persistence of those objects by saving them to (and retrieving them from) a persistent store.  Core Data is tightly integrated with the Cocoa bindings technology.  The MVC and object modeling design patterns are essential determinants of the Core Data architecture.\r\n Undo.  In the undo architecture, model objects once again play a central role.  The primitive methods of model objects (which are usually its accessor methods) are often where you implement undo and redo operations.  The view and controller objects of an action may also be involved in these operations;  for example, you might have such objects give specific titles to the undo and redo menu items, or you might have them undo selections in a text view."

        "text":"Russian women are very strange sometimes.  So don’t try to understand Russian women.  Just accept them like they are.\r\n\r\n How does a typical Russian girl look?  She has blond hair.  Usually blue or green eyes and light skin.  Furthermore, she looks quite healthy.  Here it is rare to meet women with excess weight.  This is because Russian food is more natural.  But in fact only a some of the Russian girls look like that.  In reality a lot of them have dark, even black hair and hazel eyes.  In some regions of the country you can even meet women with a special shape of eyes that have something in common with Japanese or Korean eyes.  Of course they are not pure Russians but they speak Russian without any accent and they have Russian passports.  That is so because Russia is a big country and there are many peoples living on its territory.  This mixture of different peoples created modern Russian women with such interesting kinds of appearance.\r\n\r\n Russian women adore shopping.  No matter how much they earn they spend lots of money on clothes, shoes, bags etc.  They all try to be stylish and really think a lot about the way they look.  Who knows, maybe that is why they are considered to be nice looking abroad.  It’s not a good solution to a problem for them to buy a t-shirt of bigger size if they get some extra kilos.  They will try to get to a good shape with the help of the gym, diets or something like that.  Some foreigners coming to Russia say that girls here are always dressed like they are going clubbing.  That is so because they try to be more elegant.  And other foreigners say “Russian girls dress not for men but for other women”.  Yeah, I think it’s true.  Really women here pay a lot of attention to the way they look and maybe even more attention to the way other women look.  This gives them a lot of information.  For example, about good or bad taste, about life style, profession, age, maybe even psychological age, some features of character and lots of other things.  And it’s ok when one woman asks a second woman, who she doesn’t know, about the perfume she is wearing.  It can be accepted as a kind of a compliment.  Yes really strange thing and not very common but don’t be surprised.\r\n\r\n Another interesting feature of women here is their make up.  Comparing with Western women Russians have much more cosmetics.  If you are in Europe or in the USA you can meet lots of girls with no make up, here you will see very few of them.  Some women don’t leave home without cosmetics even if they are just going to the nearest shop.\r\n\r\n Russian women like talking very much.  They usually have lots of friends.  That is why they just can’t live without phone.  In Russia it’s called sometimes “sidet na telephone” that can be translated to English to sit on the phone.  That means to spend hours speaking on the phone.  They meet each other very often to speak about their problems, to tell secrets, to discuss the latest events, to advise something or to get a piece of advice.  Because they speak so often sometimes their talks come to gossip.\r\n\r\n When they are in the hairdressing saloon they speak a lot too.  There are even some jokes about their communicating with people there.  Sometimes your hairdresser knows everything about you.  I don’t know why, but Russian women really tell secrets to people working with their hair.  Sometimes the choice of a hairdresser depends not only on quality of her work but also on her communicating skills.  Often you feel like you are not at a hairdressing saloon but at the psychologist.\r\n\r\n Russian women are often good mothers and wives.  Most of them can cook very well.  It’s usually clean in their houses.  And they always need someone to take care of.  It’s very important to women here.  If there is nobody to take care of there is no sense to do something only for yourself.  That is how some of them think.\r\n\r\n And don’t forget.  Russian women are very strong in some moments.  There is a proverb here.  A woman will stop a running horse and will come into a burning house.  That shows how desperate they can be.  That means that woman will do everything she can for those people she became attached to.  But in spite of strength of Russian women they are always looking for men who are stronger than they are.\r\n\r\n Russian women are unique because they are something between European and Asian type.  They have taken some features from European women lately.  For example they started driving cars and 10 years ago it was real exotic to see a driving woman in Russia.  But they smoke and drink more now.  Besides career plays a bigger role in their lives.  So you see there are some good and bad sides.  Anyway in most things Russian women are still the same."

        "text":"People who do not get enough vitamin A in their diet may develop night blindness.  But in the developing world a lack of vitamin A causes much more serious harm to children.  The World Health Organization links vitamin A deficiency to as many as two hundred fifty thousand child deaths every year.  One excellent source of vitamin A is found in sweet potatoes with orange flesh.  Orange sweet potatoes contain high levels of beta-carotene, which the body changes into vitamin A. Experts say orange sweet potatoes specially bred for growing conditions in Africa could help solve the lack of vitamin A there.  But, first, more people will need to be persuaded to eat them.  Jan Low with the International Potato Center, a research organization, says the sweet potato needs a better image in Africa.  She said: \"We do have an image problem with sweet potato in general in sub-Saharan Africa.  It is seen as a crop of the poor.\"  Ms. Low explains that sweet potatoes are mainly grown by poor women to feed their families in case another crop fails.  The sweet potatoes commonly grown in Africa have white or yellow flesh.  But they are low in vitamin A. Jan Low took part in a project to study how best to market orange sweet potatoes to Africans.  She worked on an information campaign in Mozambique and Uganda.The campaign included radio messages about the nutritional benefits of the orange sweet potato.  They advertised its ability to \"fight diseases, make you strong, clear your skin and make you look healthy.\"  In areas without radio, the campaigners spread the message through community theater.  The performances included singing, dancing and storytelling.And everywhere they went, the campaigners wore orange T-shirts and hats.  They even drove orange vehicles.  Jan Low says the color of the tuber made it easier to gain public attention.  Dan Gustafson heads the Washington office of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.  He points to efforts in the past to increase the popularity of other nutritious crops.  He says most of these efforts failed because organizers of the campaigns did not consider what people wanted to eat.  But Mr. Gustafson sees a better chance for the efforts to increase the popularity of the orange sweet potato in Africa.  For one thing, except for the color, the vegetable is similar to what people already use.For VOA Special English, I'm Alex Villarreal."

Dispassionate calm can be a useful frame of mind, but it does not make for a compelling performance.\r\n I played for hours, and by the end of it I felt like myself again.  By which I mean I could look at Felurian with no more reaction than you might normally feel, looking at the most beautiful woman in the world.\r\n I can still remember her, sitting naked among the cushions, twilight-colored butterflies dancing in the air between us.  I wouldn’t have been alive had I not been aroused.  But my mind seemed to be my own again, and I was grateful for that.\r\n She made a disappointed noise of protest as I set the lute back into its case.  “are you weary?”  she asked with a hint of a smile.  “I would not have tired you, sweet poet, had I known.”\r\n I gave my best apologetic smile.  “I’m sorry, but it seems to be getting late.”  Actually, the sky still showed the same purple hint of twilight it had since I first woke, but I pushed on.  “I’ll need to be moving quickly if I’m to meet . .  .”\r\n My mind went numb as quickly as if I’d been struck a blow to the back of my head.  I felt the passion, fierce and insatiable.  I felt the need to have her, to crush her body to mine, to taste the savage sweetness of her mouth.\r\n Only because of my arcane training did I hold onto any concept of my own identity at all.  Even so, I only held it with my barest fingertips.\r\n Felurian sat cross-legged on the cushions across from me, her face angry and terrible, her eyes cold and hard as distant stars.  With a deliberate calm she brushed a slowly fanning butterfly from her shoulder.  There was such a weight of fury in her simple gesture that my stomach clenched and I realized this fact:\r\nNo one ever left Felurian.  Ever.  She kept men until their bodies and minds broke beneath the strain of loving her.  She kept them until she tired of them, and when she sent them away it was the leaving that drove men mad.\r\n I was powerless.  I was a novelty.  I was a toy, favorite because it was newest.  It might be a long while before she tired of me, but the time would come.  And when she finally set me free my mind would tear itself apart with wanting her.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN Blood and Bitter Rue\r\n As I sat among the silks with my control slipping away, I felt a wave of cold sweat sweep over my body.  I clenched my jaw and felt a small anger flare up.  Over the course of my life my mind has been the only thing I’ve always been able to rely on, the only thing that has always been entirely mine.\r\n I could feel my resolve melting as my natural desires were replaced by some animal thing unable to think beyond its own lust.\r\n The part of me that was still Kvothe raged, but I felt my body respond to her presence.  With a horrible fascination I felt myself crawl through the cushions toward her.  One arm found her slender waist, and I bent to kiss her with a terrible hunger.\r\n I howled inside my own mind.  I have been beaten and whipped, starved and stabbed.  But my mind is my own, no matter what becomes of this body or the world around.  I threw myself against the bars of an intangible cage made of moonlight and desire.\r\n And, somehow, I held myself away from her.  My breath tore out of my throat as if racing to escape.\r\n Felurian reclined on the cushions, her head tilted up toward me.  Her lips were pale and perfect.  Her eyes half-lidded and hungry.\r\n I forced myself to look away from her face, but there was nowhere safe to look.  Her throat was smooth and delicate, trembling with her rapid pulse.  One breast stood round and full, while the other angled slightly to one side, following the downward slope of her body.  They rose and fell with her breath, moving gently, making candle-cast shadows on her skin.  I glimpsed the perfect whiteness of her teeth behind the pale pink of her parted lips. . . .\r\n I closed my eyes, but somehow that only made it worse.  The heat of her body was like standing near a fire.  The skin of her waist was soft beneath my hand.  She moved beneath me, and her breast brushed softly against my chest.  I felt her breath against my neck.  I shivered and began to sweat.\r\n I opened my eyes again and saw her staring at me.  Her expression was innocent, almost hurt, as if she couldn’t understand being refused.  I nursed my small flame of anger.  No one did this to me.  No one.  I held myself away from her.  A slight line of a frown touched her forehead, as if she were annoyed, or angry, or concentrating.\r\n Felurian reached up to touch my face, her eyes intent as if trying to read something written deep inside me.  I tried to pull back, remembering her touch, but my body simply shook.  Beads of sweat fell from my skin to patter gently on the silk cushions and the flat plane of her stomach below.\r\n She touched my cheek softly.  Softly, I bent to kiss her, and something broke in my mind.\r\n I felt the snap as four years of my life slid away.  Suddenly I was back on the streets of Tarbean.  Three boys, bigger than me with greasy hair and piggish eyes had dragged me from the broken crate where I’d been sleeping.  Two of them held me down, pinning my arms.  I lay in a stagnant puddle that was bitterly cold.  It was early in the morning and the stars were out.\r\n One of them had his hand over my mouth.  It didn’t matter.  I had been in the city for months.  I knew better than to yell for help.  At best no one would come.  At worst someone would, and then there would be more of them.\r\n Two of them held me down.  The third cut my clothes off my body.  He cut me.  They told me what they were going to do.  Their breath was horribly warm against my face.  They laughed.\r\n There in Tarbean, half-naked and helpless, I felt something well up inside me.  I bit two fingers off the hand over my mouth.  I heard a scream and swearing as one of them staggered away.  I strained and strained against the one who was still on top of me.  I heard my own arm break, and his grip loosened.  I started to howl.\r\n I threw him off.  Still screaming I stood, my clothes hanging in rags around me.  I knocked one of them to the ground.  My scrabbling hand found a loose cobblestone and I used it to break one of his legs.  I remember the noise it made.  I flailed until his arms were broken, then I broke his head.\r\n When I looked up, I saw the one who had cut me was gone.  The third huddled against a wall.  He clutched his bloody hand to his chest.  His eyes were white and wild.  Then I heard footsteps approaching, and I dropped the stone and ran and ran and ran. . . .\r\n Suddenly, years later, I was that feral boy again.  I jerked my head back and snarled inside my mind.  I felt something deep inside myself.  I reached for it.\r\n A tense stillness settled inside of me, the sort of silence that comes before a thunderclap.  I felt the air begin to crystallize around me.\r\n I felt cold.  Detachedly, I gathered up the pieces of my mind and fit them all together.  I was Kvothe the trouper, Edema Ruh born.  I was Kvothe the student, Re’lar under Elodin.  I was Kvothe the musician.  I was Kvothe.\r\n I stood above Felurian.\r\n I felt as if this was the only time in my life I had been fully awake.  Everything looked clear and sharp, as if I was seeing with a new set of eyes.  As if I wasn’t bothering with my eyes at all, and was looking at the world directly with my mind.\r\n The sleeping mind, some piece of me realized faintly.  No longer sleeping, I thought and smiled.\r\n I looked at Felurian, and in that moment I understood her down to the bottoms of her feet.  She was of the Fae.  She did not worry over right or wrong.  She was a creature of pure desire, much like a child.  A child does not concern itself with consequence, neither does a sudden storm.  Felurian resembled both, and neither.  She was ancient and innocent and powerful and proud.\r\n Was this the way Elodin saw the world?  Was this the magic he spoke of?  Not secrets or tricks, but Taborlin the Great magic.  Always there, but beyond my seeing until now?\r\n It was beautiful.\r\n I met Felurian’s eyes and the world grew slow and sluggish.  I felt as if I had been thrust underwater, as if my breath had been pressed from my body.  For that tiny moment I was stunned and numb as if I had been struck by lightning.\r\n The moment passed and things began to move again.  But now, looking into Felurian’s twilight eyes, I understood her far beyond the bottoms of her feet.  Now I knew her to the marrow of her bones.  Her eyes were like four lines of music, clearly penned.  My mind was filled with the sudden song of her.  I drew a breath and sang it out in four hard notes.\r\n Felurian sat upright.  She passed her hand before her eyes and spoke a word as sharp as shattered glass.  There was a pain like thunder in my head.  Darkness flickered at the edges of my sight.  I tasted blood and bitter rue.\r\n The world snapped back into focus, and I caught myself before I fell.\r\n Felurian frowned.  Straightened.  Stood.  Her face intent, she took a step.\r\n Standing, she was not tall or terrible.  Her head was barely level with my chin.  Her dark hair hung, a sheaf of shadow, straight as a knife until it brushed against her curving hip.  She was slight, and pale, and perfect.  Never have I seen a face so sweet, a mouth so made for kissing.  She was no longer frowning.  Not smiling either.  Her lips were soft and slightly parted.\r\n She took another step.  The simple motion of her moving leg was like a dance, the unexaggerated shifting of her hip entrancing as a fire.  The arch of her bare foot said more of sex than anything I’d seen in my young life.\r\n Another step.  Her smile was fierce and full.  She was as lovely as the moon.  Her power hung about her like a mantle.  It shook the air.  It spread behind her like a pair of vast and unseen wings.\r\n Close enough to touch, I felt her power thrumming in the air.  Desire rose around me like the sea in storm.  She raised her hand.  She touched my chest.  I shook.\r\n She met my eyes, and in the twilight written there I saw again the four clear lines of song.\r\n I sang them out.  They burst from me like birds into the open air.\r\n Suddenly my mind was clear again.  I drew a breath and held her eyes in mine.  I sang again, and this time I was full of rage.  I shouted out the four hard notes of song.  I sang them tight and white and hard as iron.  And at the sound of them, I felt her power shake then shatter, leaving nothing in the empty air but ache and anger.\r\n Felurian gave a startled cry and sat so suddenly that it was almost like a fall.  She curled her knees toward herself and huddled, watching me with wide and frightened eyes.\r\n Looking around, I saw the wind.  Not the way you might see smoke or fog, I saw the ever-changing wind itself.  It was familiar as the face of a forgotten friend.  I laughed and spread my arms, marveling at its shifting shape.\r\n I cupped my hands and breathed a sigh into the hollow space within.  I spoke a name.  I moved my hands and wove my breath gossamer-thin.  It billowed out, engulfing her, then burst into a silver flame that trapped her tight inside its changing name.\r\n I held her there above the ground.  She watched me with an air of fear and disbelief, her dark hair dancing like a second flame inside the first.\r\n I knew then that I could kill her.  It would be as simple as throwing a sheet of paper to the wind.  But the thought sickened me, and I was reminded of ripping the wings from a butterfly.  Killing her would be destroying something strange and wonderful.  A world without Felurian was a poorer world.  A world I would like a little less.  It would be like breaking Illien’s lute.  It would be like burning down a library in addition to ending a life.\r\n On the other hand, my safety and sanity were at stake.  I believed the world was more interesting with Kvothe in it as well.\r\n But I couldn’t kill her.  Not like this.  Not wielding my newfound magic like a dissecting knife.\r\n I spoke again, and the wind brought her down among the pillows.  I made a tearing motion and the silver flame that once had been my breath became three notes of broken song and went to play among the trees.\r\n I sat.  She reclined.  We looked each other over for several long minutes.  Her eyes flashed from fear to caution to curiosity.  I saw myself reflected in her eyes, naked among the cushions.  My power rode like a white star on my brow.\r\n Then I began to feel a fading.  A forgetting.  I realized the name of the wind no longer filled my mouth, and when I looked around I saw nothing but empty air.  I tried to remain outwardly calm, but as these things left me I felt like a lute whose strings were being cut.  My heart clenched with a loss I hadn’t felt since my parents died.\r\n I could see a slight shimmer in the air around Felurian, some shred of her power returning.  I ignored it as I struggled frantically to keep some part of what I had learned.  But it was like trying to hold a handful of sand.  If you have ever dreamed of flying, then come awake, dismayed to realize you had lost the trick of it, you have some inkling how I felt.\r\n Piece by piece it faded until there was nothing left.  I felt hollow inside and ached as badly as if I’d discovered my family never loved me.  I swallowed against the lump in my throat.\r\n Felurian looked at me curiously.  I could still see myself reflected in her eyes, the star on my forehead no more than a pinprick of light.  Then even the perfect vision of my sleeping mind began to fade.  I looked desperately at the world around me.  I tried to memorize the sight of it, unblinking.\r\n Then it was gone.  I bowed my head, half in grief and half to hide the tears.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-EIGHT The Lay of Felurian\r\n A long moment passed before I regained enough of my composure to look up.  There was a hesitancy in the air, as if we were young lovers who didn’t know what was expected of us next, who didn’t know what parts we were supposed to play.\r\n I picked up my lute and brought it close to my chest.  The motion was instinctive, like clutching a wounded hand.  I struck a chord out of habit, then made it minor so the lute seemed to be saying sad.\r\n"

        "text":"In Russian it’s usual to have meals three times a day.  There is breakfast, dinner and supper.\r\n\r\n Neither breakfast nor its preperation usually takes much time.  In Russia it’s not common to eat much for breakfast.  A usual breakfast could include an omelette, sandwiches, corn flakes or something like that.  But of course there are some traditional Russian dishes.  For example sirniki.  Sirniki is made from dough containing lots of cottage cheese and fried on a pan.  They are usually served with sour cream and sugar.  Blini and blinchiki are other common morning meals.  Blini are practically the same as English pancakes.  In Russia they are served with butter and sugar.  Blinchiki are very thin blini.  Of course they are made from other dough.  The thinner the blinchiki are, the tastier they are.  Besides there are blinchiki with stuffing.  There is a plenty of different stuffing.  For example blinchiki with cottage cheese, meat, jam.  If you are in Russia on Maslenica (Shrovetide, Shrove Tuesday) you can try different kinds of blinchiki because on that holiday blinchiki are considered to be the main and necessary dish.  Try blinchiki with caviar - the posh variant of the course.  Russians really love caviar and serve it on many holidays.\r\n\r\n But let’s go back to breakfast.  Kasha (porridge) is another traditional dish for breakfast in Russia.  You will find it on the table more often than sirniki or blinchiki because it’s much simpler to prepare.  Not only porridge is popular but also cereal made from other different grains.  Usually breakfast is accompanied with a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n Dinner consists of several courses.  From the times of Soviet cafeterias it’s common to call them first course, second course and third course.  First course is a soup.  Second course includes meat and garnish.  A drink in Russia is called third course.  It’s usually tea, coffee, juice or compote.  Sometimes third course includes a dessert.  The official time for dinner at work is usually from noon till 1 o’clock PM.  At home, for example on the weekend, dinner is usually later – at three or four o’clock PM.\r\n\r\n All family gathers together for supper and this is probably the longest and the nicest meal of the day.  Supper usually starts near seven o’clock PM and can last for some hours.  They discuss the latest events at the table and members of family share their emotions with each other.  Guests are usually invited for supper.  At supper you have a wonderful opportunity to discover Russian cuisine.\r\n\r\n So what do Russians eat?  At first shi of course.  Shi is a soup made from meat, cabbage, carrot, potatoes, tomatoes and onion.  Add some sour-cream to it and you’ll get a delicious taste.  That’s something that helps Russians to warm during the cold winter.  Maybe many people haven’t heard about shi before, but everybody knows borshch.  In fact borshch is shi with beet.  That’s the main difference between these soups.  Borshch is more often related to courses of the Ukrainian cuisine.\r\n\r\n There is also traditional salad in Russia.  Ask any Russian what salad it is and he or she will answer you in a moment.  This is olivye!  Russians prepare it on every holiday.  It has become a great tradition here.  This salad is sometimes called Russian salad abroad.  And the name “olivye” has a French origin.  It’s strange but in Russia this salad is considered to be a course brought to Russia by a French man Olivye.  Of course it’s hard to say if it’s true or not.  Besides olivye doesn’t have any relation to the French cuisine.  It is prepared from boiled chicken, potato, carrot, conserved peas, pickled cucumbers, onion and mayonnaise.  It's a little strange mixture of ingredients but try it anyway, and you’ll understand that it’s really very tasty.\r\n\r\n Another dish of Russian cuisine containing a lot of ingredients, which at first sight don’t seem to suit each other, is okroshka.  The word “okroshka” comes from the verb “kroshit” that in English means “to crumble”, “to cut”.  So the name of the course speaks for itself because during its preparing many kinds of products are crumbled & cut.\r\n\r\n The base of the course is kvass.  Kvass is a traditional drink in Russia itself.  Depending on what part of the country you visit you have an opportunity to try either dark or light kvass.  And the fact that you like dark kvass still doesn’t mean that you’ll like the light one, because it tastes much different.  All that you need to do is to add there boiled meat, eggs, potherb, cucumbers, radish, some milk and the soup is ready.  Finally you get delicious cold soup which is the favorite dish of many Russian especially in the summer time.  But okroshka has a very special taste so foreigners may not like it for the first time.\r\n\r\n Beside soups, Russians have some other tasty things.  Golubci and pelmeni are among them.  They are popular in many countries abroad but you should try them in Russia because here they are the best.\r\n\r\n Bread plays a very important role in the meal.  Russians eat bread with practically all dishes.  In Russia they cook light and dark bread.  The colour of bread depends on the kind of flour is used for its preperation.  In the past bread was baked in special ovens in the country.  That bread has a wonderful taste and of course it can’t be compared with that bread which shops supply.  Unfortunately this tradition is disappearing nowadays, although some elderly people continue baking bread and don’t buy it in the shops.\r\n\r\n Among drinks Russians often like tea and vodka.  Perhaps Russian climate which is famous by its cold weather influenced this choice of drinks.  But when it’s warm Russians drink kvass and compote with pleasure.\r\n\r\n What?  Already hungry?  So come to Russia as soon as you can!  Yes, and don’t forget to say “Pryatnogo appetita!”  at the table.  It’s considered to be polite here to wish everyone 'good appetite'."

        "text":"In the summer of 1960, while I was an anthropology student at the University of California, Los Angeles, I made several trips to the Southwest to collect information on the medicinal plants used by the Indians of the area.  The events I describe here began during one of my trips.\r\n\r\n I was waiting in a border town for a Greyhound bus;  talking with a friend who had been my guide and helper in my survey.\r\n\r\n Suddenly he leaned towards me and whispered that the man, a white-haired old Indian who was sitting in front of the window, was very learned about plants, especially peyote.  I asked my friend to introduce me to this man.\r\n\r\n My friend greeted him, and then went over and shook his hand.  After they had talked for a while, my friend signaled me to join them, but immediately left me alone with the old man;  not even bothering to introduce us.\r\n\r\n The old Indian was not in the least embarrassed.  I told him my name, and he said that he was called Juan Matus, and that he was at my service.  He used the Spanish polite form of address.  We shook hands at my initiative and then remained silent for some time.  It was not a strained silence, but a quietness: natural and relaxed on both sides.\r\n\r\n Though his dark face and neck were wrinkled, showing his age, it struck me that his body was agile and muscular.\r\n\r\n I then told him that I was interested in obtaining information about medicinal plants.  Although in truth I was almost totally ignorant about peyote, I found myself pretending that I knew a great deal, and I even suggested that it might be to his advantage to talk with me.  As I rattled on, he nodded slowly and looked at me, but said nothing.  I avoided his eyes and we finished by standing, the two of us, in dead silence.\r\n\r\n Finally, after what seemed a very long time, don Juan got up and looked out of the window.  His bus had come.  He said good-bye and left the station.\r\n\r\n I was annoyed at having talked nonsense to him, and at being seen through by his remarkable eyes.\r\n\r\n When my friend returned he tried to console me for my failure to learn anything from don Juan.  He explained that the old man was often silent or noncommittal;  but the disturbing effect of this first encounter was not so easily dispelled.\r\n\r\n I made a point of finding out where don Juan lived, and later visited him several times.  On each visit I tried to lead him to discuss peyote, but without success.  We became, nonetheless, very good friends, and my scientific investigation was forgotten;  or was at least redirected into channels that were worlds apart from my original intention.\r\n\r\n The friend who had introduced me to don Juan explained later that the old man was not a native of Arizona, but was a Yaqui Indian from Sonora, Mexico.\r\n\r\n At first I saw don Juan simply as a rather peculiar man who knew a great deal about peyote, and who spoke Spanish remarkably well;  but the people who lived around him believed that he had some sort of 'secret knowledge';  that he was a 'brujo'.\r\n\r\n The Spanish word brujo means, in English, medicine man, curer, witch, or sorcerer.  It connotes, essentially, a person who has extraordinary, and usually evil powers.\r\n\r\n I had known don Juan for a whole year before he took me into his confidence.  One day he explained that he possessed a certain knowledge that he had learned from a teacher, a 'benefactor', as he called him, who had directed him in a kind of apprenticeship.  Don Juan had, in turn, chosen me to serve as his apprentice, but he warned me that I would have to make a very deep commitment and that the training was long and arduous.\r\n\r\n In describing his teacher, don Juan used the word 'diablero'.  Later I learned that diablero is a term used only by the Sonoran Indians.  It refers to an evil person who practices black sorcery and is capable of transforming himself into an animal: a bird, a dog, a coyote, or any other creature.  On one of my visits to Sonora, I had a peculiar experience that illustrated the Indians' feeling about diableros.\r\n\r\n I was driving at night in the company of two Indian friends when I saw an animal that seemed to be a dog crossing the highway.  One of my companions said it was not a dog, but a huge coyote.  I slowed down and pulled to the side of the road to get a good look at the animal.  It stayed within range of the headlights a few seconds longer and then ran into the chaparral.  It was unmistakably a coyote, but it was twice the ordinary size.\r\n\r\n Talking excitedly, my friends agreed that it was a very unusual animal, and one of them suggested that it might be a diablero.  I decided to use an account of the experience to question the Indians of that area about their beliefs in the existence of diableros.  I talked with many people, telling them the story and asking them questions.  The three conversations that follow indicate what they felt."

        "text":" For a time we followed a twisting path of smooth paved stone that led us over the arch of a high bridge.  All the while the moths followed us, giving me only the dimmest impression of our surroundings.\r\n Eventually Felurian stopped.  By now the darkness was so thick I could almost feel it like a warm blanket around me.  I could tell by the sound of the wind in the trees and the motion of the moths that we were standing in an open space.\r\n There were no stars above us.  If we were in a clearing, the trees must be vast for their branches to meet overhead.  But for all I knew we could just as easily be deep underground.  Or perhaps the sky was black and empty in this portion of the Fae.  It was a strangely unsettling thought.\r\n The subtle feeling of sleeping alertness was stronger here.  If the rest of the Fae felt like it was sleeping, this place felt like it had stirred half a moment ago and hovered on the verge of waking.  It was disconcerting.\r\n Felurian gently pressed the flat of her hand against my chest, then a finger against my lips.  I watched as she moved away from me, softly humming a little snatch of the song I had made for her.  But even this piece of flattery couldn’t distract me from the fact that I was in the center of the Fae realm, blind, stark naked, and without the slightest idea of what was going on.\r\n A handful of moths had landed on Felurian, resting on her wrist, hip, shoulder and thigh.  Watching them gave me a vague impression of her movements.  If I had to guess, I would have said she was picking things out of the trees, from behind or beneath bushes or stones.  A warm breeze sighed through the clearing, and I felt strangely comforted as it brushed my bare skin.\r\n After about ten minutes, Felurian came back and kissed me.  She held something soft and warm in her arms.\r\n We walked back the way we had come.  The moths gradually lost interest in us, leaving us with less and less of an impression of our surroundings.  After what seemed an interminable amount of time I saw light filtering through a break in the trees ahead.  It was only faint starlight, but at that moment it seemed bright as a curtain of burning diamonds.\r\n I started to walk through it, but Felurian took hold of my arm to stop me.  Without a word she sat me down where the first faint beams of starlight lanced through the trees to touch the ground.\r\n Carefully she stepped between the rays of starlight, avoiding them as if they might burn her.  When she stood in the center of them, she lowered herself to the ground and sat cross-legged, facing me.  She held whatever she had collected in her lap, but other than the fact that it was shapeless and dark I could tell nothing about it.\r\n Then Felurian reached out a hand, took hold of one of the thin beams of starlight, and pulled it toward the dark shape in her lap.\r\n I might have been more surprised if Felurian’s manner hadn’t been so casual.  In the dim light, I saw her hands make a familiar motion.  A second later she reached out again, almost absentmindedly, and grasped another narrow strand of starlight between her thumb and forefinger.\r\n She drew it in as easily as the first and manipulated it in the same way.  Again the motion struck me as familiar, but it was nothing I could press my finger to.\r\n Felurian started to hum quietly to herself as she gathered in the next beam of starlight, brightening things an imperceptible amount.  The shape in her lap looked like thick, dark cloth.  Seeing this I realized what she reminded me of: my father sewing.  Was she sewing by starlight?\r\n Sewing with starlight.  Realization came to me in a flood.  Shaed meant shadow.  She had somehow brought back an armful of shadow and was sewing it with starlight.  Sewing me a cloak of shadow.\r\n Sound absurd?  It did to me.  But regardless of my ignorant opinion, Felurian took hold of another strand of starlight and brought it to her lap.  I brushed any doubt aside.  Only a fool disbelieves what he sees with his own eyes.\r\n Besides, the stars above me were bright and strange.  I was sitting next to a creature out of a storybook.  She had been young and beautiful for a thousand years.  She could stop my heart with a kiss and talk to butterflies.  Was I going to start quibbling now?\r\n After a while I moved closer so I could watch more carefully.  She smiled as I sat next to her, favoring me with a hasty kiss.\r\n I asked a couple questions, but her answers either made no sense or were hopelessly nonchalant.  She didn’t know the first thing about the laws of sympathy, or sygaldry, or the Alar.  She simply didn’t think there was anything odd about sitting in the forest holding a handful of shadow.  First I was offended, then I was terribly jealous.\r\n I remembered when I’d found the name of the wind in her pavilion.  It had felt as if I were truly awake for the first time, true knowledge running like ice in my blood.\r\n The memory exhilarated me for a moment, then left me with a broken chord of loss.  My sleeping mind was slumbering again.  I turned my attention back to Felurian and tried to understand.\r\n Before too long, Felurian stood in a fluid motion and helped me to my feet.  She hummed happily and took my arm as we strolled back the way we had come, chatting of little things.  She held the dark shape of the shaed draped easily over her arm.\r\n Then, just as the first faint hint of twilight began to touch the sky, she hung it invisibly in the dark branches of a nearby tree.  “sometimes slow seduction is the only way,” she said.  “the gentle shadow fears the candleflame.  how could your fledgling shaed not feel the same?”"

        "text":"At a few minutes before 8 in the morning on the eve of Russia Day last month  —  the holiday that since the demise of the old Soviet Union has marked the birth of the new, free Russia  —  eight men, some armed, swept silently into an upscale apartment building in the heart of Moscow.  When the knock came, Ksenia Sobchak, a 30-year-old native of St. Petersburg who many believe is Vladimir Putin’s goddaughter (she says she isn’t), answered the door in a negligee.  If you read the tabloids, whether in Moscow or London, Sobchak is “the Paris Hilton of Russia,” the country’s reigning, and most outrageous, socialite.  But if you ask her, after a season of discontent in which tens of thousands of her compatriots have taken to the streets in protest, she is “a political journalist.”  In the room behind her, her boyfriend, Ilya Yashin, a baby-faced 29-year-old leader of the People’s Freedom Party, bolted out of bed.\r\n For six hours the men  —  a squad from the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation  —  tore apart the apartment, neither removing their masks nor dropping their weapons.  “You know what’s going on,” one of them chided her.  “If you had married a good K.G.B. man, it would be another story.”  They teased her by reading love letters from an ex-beau aloud in front of Yashin.  And they humiliated her by sending a man to shadow her to the bathroom.  Millions of Russians had seen Sobchak in various stages of undress before, but for the first time this was not a performance of her own making.  In Sobchak’s safe, the officers reportedly discovered nearly one million euros and half a million dollars in dozens of envelopes.  The state, Sobchak said when she described the episode to me in late June, had found its jackpot  —  and made, Sobchak believes, its intentions clear.  “Whether it’s prison or exile,” she said, “they’re out to silence me.”\r\n\r\n On that same June morning, several leaders of the opposition in Russia also had their homes raided by investigators.  But Sobchak stands apart: in this new time of troubles, as Putin settles back into the Kremlin for his third term as president, few Russians more closely embody the state of the country today  —  in both its prospects and its hazards  —  than Sobchak.  She has money and, with more than 470,000 followers on Twitter (making hers one of the most popular private Russian accounts), a following.  And she is staking both resources in the fight for, as she puts it, “a better way to live.”\r\n\r\n “Please don’t call me a revolutionary,” she insisted one night earlier this spring in Moscow as she was waiting to go on the Dozhd (Rain) TV channel.  Yet since last fall, when she surprised nearly everyone in Russia and embraced the protest movement, Sobchak has been one of the opposition’s loudest cheerleaders, exploiting every available platform  —  whether on TV, radio, the Internet, in print or through Russia’s booming social media networks  —  to call for an end to the country’s woes: Putin’s reign, the police state, the absence of a free press.  She has held court at rallies, looked for electoral fraud at polling stations, flown a hundred Muscovites south to support an embattled regional leader, supplied a protesters’ encampment in the capital with latrines and come out in support of a band of female punk rockers who donned masks to storm the biggest cathedral in Moscow.  She has been arrested at a protest and endured a brief spell in jail. "

        "text":"Still she presses on, risking her lucrative career on behalf of a more democratic Motherland.\r\n\r\n Sobchak knows well the toll of a Kremlin campaign of torment.  She remembers how Boris Yeltsin turned against her father, Anatoli Sobchak, a law professor who rose to prominence amid the Soviet ruins with the bearing and look  —  tall, lean, erudite-sounding  —  of a Western European politician.  He seemed the opposite of Yeltsin, the mercurial bear.  In August 1991, during the coup that sought to topple Gorbachev, Sobchak rallied the crowds in Leningrad, where he was the mayor.  Putin, formerly a middling lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B. who had been given his first job in politics by Sobchak the year before, rarely left Sobchak’s side in those tense hours.  They seemed an odd pair, but Sobchak, who taught Putin in the 1970s, shrugged off his aide’s K.G.B. past, even vowing to make him an ambassador.  After the coup was put down, Putin became a top deputy, in charge of foreign commercial relations in a city besieged by European suitors.\r\n\r\n By 1995, Yeltsin, who ascended to power after the coup, was enfeebled and beleaguered, facing long odds of re-election.  He called in Sobchak to ask if he should run.  Sobchak recommended that, given Yeltsin’s health, a successor be found.  It was a loyalty test, and Sobchak failed.  In the months that followed, a sordid string of accusations against Sobchak appeared in the press.  Whether a Kremlin smear campaign, as Sobchak maintained, or a series of legitimate state inquiries, the toll became real.  In 1996, as Sobchak ran for re-election in the mayoral race, a Kremlin proxy and former Sobchak deputy defeated him by less than 2 percent of the vote.  With an indictment looming, Sobchak was hospitalized in 1997 for heart trouble.  A secret rescue ensued;  a charter plane from Finland spirited him away to Paris.  Whatever Yeltsin thought of Sobchak, he admired Putin’s loyalty to him, and in his memoirs he credited Putin with orchestrating the escape.\r\n\r\n In the summer of 1999, with Putin atop the security services, Sobchak came home.  That fall, Yeltsin named Putin his acting prime minister, then, in a New Year’s Eve surprise, turned the Kremlin over to him.  When Putin faced his first election, for president, he named Sobchak a campaign representative.  The charges against him, miraculously, were dropped.  Then, in February 2000, Sobchak died of a heart attack while stumping for Putin in Kaliningrad.  “We used to talk a lot,” Putin said.  “He was a friend and mentor to me.”\r\n\r\n Muckrakers raised the specter of poisoning, but the coroner ruled it a natural death.  To his daughter, the cause of death was obvious: the stress caused by the Kremlin’s persecution.  Days before he died, Sobchak told Russian television that Yeltsin had given the original command, “Sic him!”  At the funeral, Putin cried.  “They put the screws to Sobchak for four years,” he said, “and then hounded the poor guy all over Europe.”  Beside him sat Sobchak’s widow and a young blond woman, 18 years old, just back from a holiday in Amsterdam, her face ashen and half-hidden by a black scarf.\r\n\r\n “It was the end of my first life,” Ksenia Sobchak says today.  Depression descended.  For months she did not leave the family apartment in St. Petersburg.  “Then one bright sunny day, I stepped outside.  And right away, I felt it: my hometown had become a nightmarish place.  I told Mama, ‘I’ve got to start a new life  —  on my own.’  ”\r\n\r\n Last year, the year she turned 30, Sobchak’s income was an estimated $2.8 million, according to Forbes.  Her commercial empire has included a fashion line, columnist gigs at glossy magazines, a stake in a leading mobile phone company, a perfume (How to Marry a Millionaire), radio shows and co-ownership of a plush restaurant in a prerevolutionary Moscow mansion.  TV, though, has been her mainstay.  She has hosted a dizzying array of shows, from “Top Model Po-Russki” (the Russian version of the Tyra Banks franchise) to “Dom-2” (“House-2,” the country’s longest-running reality TV show, kin to Britain’s “Big Brother”  —  except that, as a British critic put it, it “manages to make ‘Big Brother’ look like a model of taste and humanity”) to her own political talk shows, “GosDep” and “Sobchak Live,” on TV-Rain.  Since the opposition came alive, Rain, a three-year-old Internet and cable experiment (its tagline is “the Optimistic Channel”), has become the hippest and most independent outlet in Russia.  It also carries clout: Dmitri Medvedev, when he was president, appeared on it.  Sobchak is one of the network’s star attractions.\r\n\r\n “It may look like chaos,” she says, “but for the first time in my life I feel a kind of harmony.”  It’s a carousel of studios and soundstages, and at each stop, a triumph of four-inch stiletto heels over Soviet concrete stairs, a flurry of changes in wardrobe, makeup, hairstyle, nail polish and even eyewear.\r\n\r\n This “new life,” as Sobchak puts it, began last October, after Putin and Medvedev announced their political rokirovka  —  the castling move in chess, when a king and rook trade places to protect the king  —  a job swap that would see Putin become president again and Medvedev prime minister.  The move, at once entirely expected and utterly shocking, caused even longtime Putin loyalists to shake their heads.  For Sobchak, it was, in her words, “a point of no return.”  “Don’t imagine any deep soul-searching,” she said on the frigid afternoon when we first met late last winter.  “As anyone who knows me knows: I can’t keep my mouth shut.”\r\n\r\n At first glance, Sobchak more closely resembles a teenager than a media powerhouse.  She is lithe and, in barefoot moments, tiny.  And she remains tethered to “Mama”  —  Lyudmila Narusova, a senator in the upper house of Parliament.  Narusova is a Kremlin loyalist, fearful of her daughter’s wayward choices.  “Mama,” I heard her assure Narusova one night in March, “I’m not in jail  —  yet.”\r\n\r\n For a woman infamous for her material life  —  to many, she remains the uncouth child of Soviet privilege, a debauchee of suspect talents who imported only the worst of the West  —  Sobchak is well read.  She is also a master of surprise;  alone in an elevator, she unspooled two stanzas of Joseph Brodsky.  But she is best, perhaps, at taking fire and returning it.  Self-mockery, a rarity among Russian celebrities, is a favored weapon.\r\n\r\n Her conversion, she says, can be traced back to an evening last fall when she happened upon a Putin adjutant, Vasily Yakemenko, at one of the priciest restaurants in Russia.  Best known as the former leader of Nashi (Our Own), a Kremlin-sponsored youth “movement” that claims to nurture aspiring patriots, Yakemenko was in the vanguard of stifling dissent and stoking anti-Western sentiments.  Sobchak ambushed him with her iPhone.  The 77-second video that resulted was an experiment, she says, a digital updating of the practice, made popular in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, of outing members of the Communist Party and secret police.  “Look who’s here!”  she says in the video, feigning shock.  “Look at this restaurant, this menu  —  Bellini Champagne for 1,300 rubles a glass” ($40), “fresh oysters for 500 rubles each” ($15).  “I mean, it’s not surprising for me to be here, I’m a socialite,” Sobchak tells a flushed Yakemenko, “but you!”  On YouTube, the attack went viral.  A Nashi spokeswoman, Kristina Potupchik, shot back.  On her own blog, Potupchik called Sobchak a “cheap prostitute” before correcting herself on Twitter: “Ksenia, excuse me, I made a mistake. . . .  Of course, you’re not a cheap prostitute  —  but an expensive one!”\r\n\r\n The opposition in Russia has long been an elitist realm.  In Soviet times, the underground comprised dissidents like scientists and writers, poets and priests, who risked the gulag or exile to dare, in Solzhenitsyn’s phrase, “not to live by the lie.”  Even in the Putin era, dissenters until recently consisted mostly of ardent human rights workers and legal reformers.\r\n\r\n In the decade after Yeltsin’s departure, throughout the rollback on civil liberties, only a defiant few cried foul.  Many in the opposition have argued that Sobchak has not earned a place on their stage.  A decade of flaunting bad behavior before every camera, they argue, cannot be Photoshopped away.  When she first spoke at a rally in December, before more than 80,000, the boos nearly drowned her out.  But by March, the boos were fewer.  “I understand their fear,” Sobchak says.  “They see a threat: ‘Sobchak will blacken the image of the opposition.’  And they may be right.  But I can’t change what I’ve done, any more than I can change my biography.”\r\n\r\n Anton Nossik, one of Russia’s leading bloggers and a pioneer of the country’s digital news sites, warns against underestimating Sobchak.  “The risks are real,” he insists, “and what she’s doing, it may end up being more important than the work of any other oppositioner.  Putin has the powers of the Kremlin behind him.  But she’s got something he does not: the fans.”  President Obama’s new ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, fighting his own squabbles with Russian officialdom, recognizes the opportunity.  Within weeks of his arrival in Moscow, he tweeted Sobchak: “Want to come on your show Gosdep soon.  Lots of myths to debunk.”\r\n\r\n In the wake of the presidential election, the opposition has developed a new means of self-defense: a small tech-savvy corps able to launch rapid-fire counterattacks, posting evidence to YouTube, Twitter and an ever-growing array of popular Russian Web sites.  No one has deployed the digital arsenal to greater effect than Sobchak.  As her political critique intensified, she made a series of mock campaign ads  —  parodies of the Kremlin campaign that enlisted artists and actors to support Putin.  One faux ad featured Sobchak speaking haltingly, like a hostage at gunpoint, to praise this candidate who’s done so much for Russia  —  without mentioning Putin by name.  On YouTube, the video was seen more than two million times.\r\n\r\n An estimated 66 million Russians use the Web every day  —  the largest such national population on the European continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world.  Russians have adopted the Web not only as a public sphere for debate but also as a refuge of last resort, a citizens’ court to vent anger at and post evidence of official malfeasance.  Videos depicting supposed police abuse, state theft and even car accidents go viral in minutes.\r\n\r\n The digital frontier has updated the 19th-century fight in Russian literature, the struggle between fathers and sons.  Now the old guard, the first post-World War II generation to come to power in Russia, is squaring off against “the Generation of the Naughts,” those who came of age in the first decade of the new century.  In Moscow, and on the Web, they call themselves the kreativny klass (the creative class) and stud their speech with borrowings from English, praising not only brendy (brands) and trendy (trends) but tolerantnost as well.  Sobchak may bridge the generations better than anyone, straddling various media platforms, and worlds, with friends among the oligarchs and state officials.\r\n\r\n Though Sobchak considers herself a political journalist, not everyone in that field, as Pavel Gusev reminded me in the spring, has welcomed her.  Gusev, the 63-year-old editor in chief of Moskovsky Komsomolets, one of the most popular newspapers in Russia, knew Anatoli Sobchak well, and he has also known Putin since the early 1990s.  In 1992, as Sobchak’s deputy, Putin oversaw Gusev’s purchase of the fledgling St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik.  As a leading editor, and head of the Moscow Journalists Union, Gusev meets regularly with Putin on an off-the-record basis.  His newspaper, one of the first to turn tabloid in the post-Soviet era, has chronicled Ksenia Sobchak’s exploits.  She was “not just a socialite,” he said, “but one with a terrible image  —  after her trailed a long string of scandals.  Some were just vulgar.”  But she’s “a smart girl,” he added, echoing Sobchak’s admirers.  “She’s realized, just in time, she must change her image.  She’s understood that a Joan of Arc is in great demand.”\r\n\r\n To Gusev, Sobchak’s latest conversion may be the most foolhardy.  “The virtual world”  —  he sneered at the monitor on his desk  —  “is where the opposition lives.”  The Internet, he said, is “at least 80 percent garbage  —  lies, distortion, nonsense.”  Bloggers, he went on, live in social networks, far from reality.  “But Ksenia and her revolutionary friends forget one thing: Putin lives in this world,” he said, his forefinger tapping the table and his shoes the floor  —  “and he is not one to quit.”\r\n\r\n The plot of “Dom-2,” which has been by far Sobchak’s most profitable venture and largest national platform, is simple: Contestants build a house and compete to pair off;  a successful relationship will eventually win a house.  In the show’s eight-year run, highlights have included amateur pornography, with all varieties of gender-partnering.  In 2005, Moscow politicians petitioned the prosecutor general to shut it down, complaining that the show only “exploits the interest in sex” and accusing Sobchak of “pimping.”\r\n\r\n It is a grim spectacle, not unlike a former convict’s checking in with a parole officer.  When I attended a taping of the show in March, Sobchak rushed through the Soviet-style foyer in silence and mounted the chipped staircase in haste.  In the control room, a half-dozen producers in T-shirts and jeans faced a wall of TV monitors.  The screens revealed the interior of a “city apartment” awash in lurid colors and Sobchak racing through her paces.  It was hard to tell which looked less enviable: the producers’ workplace or the cast members’.  Sobchak perched on a sofa, opposite a sullen Wenceslas Vengrzhanovsky  —  a 30-year-old from the south of Russia, who joined the cast boasting paranormal powers.  In December, after a string of failed attempts at coupling, and facing being kicked off the show, he at last married a fellow cast member.  “Dom-2” fans can track the longevity of their favorite “characters” online.  It has become a Russian tradition, like the pride the state took in the cosmonauts who endured many months aboard the Mir space station.  It was Vengrzhanovsky’s 1,182nd day on the show.  (The record was 1,758.)  Sobchak feigned advice on how to handle his new wife.  “You mustn’t be so lazy,” she said, repeating, after a half-second delay, the words a producer fed into her earpiece.  For Sobchak, it was a rare performance: devoid of expression and delivered in a monotone.  Afterward, she said to me, by way of apology: “My contract’s almost up.  I can’t break it.”  By June, there was no need: she was fired from “Dom-2” and “Top Model” after the raid.\r\n\r\n Not long after the Soviet collapse, Anatoli Sobchak prophesied the turbulence to come.  “A totalitarian system,” he wrote in his 1992 book, “For a New Russia,” “leaves behind it a minefield built into both the country’s social structure and the individual psychology of its citizens.  And mines explode each time the system faces the danger of being dismantled and the country sees the prospect of genuine renewal.”  The state, of course, is unlikely to yield.  ‘‘Modernizatsia,” Gusev, the newspaper editor, says, “is a Medvedev word  —  Putin rarely uses it.”\r\n\r\n Still, Putin’s return has fueled the opposition.  Allegations of corruption have been directed at members of Putin’s inner circle, and Putin has been beset by problems: pensions to pay and a shambolic military to modernize.  Russia remains petroleum-rich, but the flow of money out of the country has hit a record high: $35.1 billion in the first quarter of this year, approaching double last year’s figure.\r\n\r\n On the morning after the raid, Sobchak appeared shaken.  She wore dark sunglasses and a black dress;  her voice was muted, her face drawn.  It was the same look she had at her father’s funeral: suddenly vulnerable, in shock, and searching for an arm to steady her.  “Don’t dare make me out to be a Trojan horse,” she pleaded in one of our last conversations.  It was a refrain I had heard more than once.  “I’m not a politician.  At least not yet.”\r\n\r\n All the same, the stakes are rising.  Called in twice for interrogations, she has hired a famed defense attorney, Henry Reznik, the Alan Dershowitz of Russia.  And through it all she has traveled far and wide, attending political meetings and stirring up the locals in places like New York, Miami, Astrakhan, London, Yekaterinburg and, just last month, Alaska.  On June 6, she tweeted a discovery: Yelena Skrynnik, recently Putin’s agriculture minister, was out on the town, she claimed, carrying an Hermès Birkin crocodile-skin purse that costs “20,000 euros” ($25,000).  Five days later, the armed squad knocked on Sobchak’s door.  The investigators have since returned her passport but not the money.  A tax-evasion case, she expects, is in the offing, but she says her accounts are clean.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"He didn’t mind standing up to them on important issues, and always had, but he didn’t want to make waves now, and prejudice them against Francesca.  If at all possible, he hoped they’d like her, and also relax their negative outlook on his living in her house.  He wanted them to see what a good person she was, and how sweet to Ian.\r\n Francesca almost expected Chris’s mother to do room inspections, and was afraid she would.  She had brought them a bottle of wine and wondered if it was enough of a gift for a whole weekend.  Maybe she should have sent them flowers instead.  They were so proper, she was afraid to do the wrong thing.  Nothing about them put her at ease.  And his mother had been polite but not warm the night before.\r\n Chris had breakfast with his mother, and then came back to find Francesca while she was getting dressed.  She had breakfast in the dining room with assorted houseguests at eight-thirty and found herself sitting next to Chris’s sister Hilary, who was too busy taking care of her four-year-old twin boys to say more than hello.  They were all going to church at ten, and Chris said it would be a good idea if she went.  She had no objection, but clearly these people were used to doing everything together.  It was a little like military school, or camp.  And Chris was much more uptight here than he was in New York.  All the men were supposed to play golf together that afternoon, but Chris said they wouldn’t if it snowed.  And in summer they played football at the Vineyard.  There were trophies for various athletic events all over the house.  One of his cousins had won a gold medal in the Olympics.  And his brother had been captain of the rowing team at Harvard.  Francesca met him after breakfast, and he looked her over and said a cursory hello.  He was four years older than Chris and planning to run for a congressional seat in the coming year.  He introduced Francesca to his wife, and then they went upstairs to dress for church.  They all seemed so different from Chris.  They seemed like very competitive people to her.  Tennis was a big deal to them, and football.  All she knew anything about was art, not sports.  She could barely contribute to the conversation at breakfast and hardly spoke.  Chris could see how nervous she was when he found her afterward.  She had worn black leather jeans and a black sweater.  All the other women were wearing twin sets and plaid skirts, and none of them short.  Francesca didn’t own a plaid skirt, of any length.\r\n She sat next to Chris’s mother in church, with Chris next to her and Ian between them.  His siblings and their families were on either side.  She had the feeling that his mother could tell if she was praying or not, or faking it, and she had X-ray vision.  Francesca had changed into a black suit to wear to church, and she felt overdressed.  His mother was wearing a navy blue twin set and gray skirt.  Francesca couldn’t think of a\r\n single outfit she’d brought that seemed right.  They had a kind of sporty but formal style.  But his mother was extremely polite and very pleasant.  His cousins seemed nice, and his father very jolly.  And his siblings were distant but friendly.  His grandfather had been governor of Massachusetts.  They were a daunting lot.  She couldn’t imagine telling any of them that her mother had been married five times.  His mother would have fainted.  His parents had been married for forty-four years, to each other and not a whole collective.  Francesca recognized that these people were the real deal, old-fashioned American aristocrats.  It was a closed world, and Chris was the only one who seemed different.  They were the definition of Old Guard.\r\n It was stressful being there, but by late afternoon Francesca had started to relax.  Several people had gone to play tennis at their club, or squash.  The children had been whisked away somewhere.  It snowed, so no one played golf, and they were expected to be downstairs for cocktails at six-thirty sharp.  Dinner was at seven-thirty, and since it was Christmas Eve, it was a fairly formal event.  The children would be eating at a separate table in the hall, adults in the formal dining room.  And they were going back to church at eleven-thirty for midnight mass.  His mother said it was optional, which Chris said meant you had to be there under penalty of death.  Nothing Chris had said to her before had prepared her for these people.  They were the rock-solid foundation of the establishment.  Chris had none of their stuffiness, but these were his roots.  He was worried they would scare her off.  And he kept watching her for signs of panic but so far there were none.  What she had noticed more than anything was that they weren’t warm.  They were perfectly behaved and polite to everyone.  They were nice to the children whenever they were around, but there was no sign of affection or warmth.  No one was laughing, no one was hugging, there were no family arguments.  They were all intelligent and very polite, and watching them made Francesca feel sad, especially for Chris.  What was missing from what she saw around her was love.\r\n Francesca was in the living room at exactly six-thirty in a black cocktail dress that looked demure enough, with heels that were too high, and an evening bag that was too jazzy, with rhinestones on it, a gift from her mother from Paris.  She wore her hair in a bun, which seemed right.  His mother wore a plain black dress with a high neck and long sleeves, and her regulation pearls that she wore with everything, and that Francesca suspected she probably slept in.  The fantasy of their two mothers together nearly made her choke.\r\n “How did you and Chris meet?”  his mother asked her over cocktails.  Francesca had no idea what to say to her.  He was living in my house didn’t sound like the right answer.  I’m his landlady ... I run a boarding house ... In church?  There was no right answer.  Chris had warned her not to say she lived at 44 Charles with him.\r\n “We met through friends.”  Chris had been listening, and wandered by to fill in.\r\n Francesca smiled silent thanks.  She was constantly afraid to do or say the wrong thing.  Chris’s father asked what kind of work her father did, and she said he was an artist.  She mentioned his name, and they were impressed by that, which was a relief.  And she mentioned that her mother was in Gstaad for Christmas.  They looked a little shocked by that.  Her father being in Sun Valley was okay.  They knew it and liked it.  But a ski resort\r\n in Europe sounded like Sodom and Gomorrah to his mother.  “The only way to get through these dinners is to get blind drunk and keep smiling,”\r\n one of his cousins told her in a whisper as they headed to dinner, and she laughed.  The suggestion had a lot of appeal, but she wouldn’t have dared do it.  You had to be alert to field their questions.  They wanted to know where she’d grown up, where she’d gone to school, whether she went to boarding school, whether she’d ever been married, and of course she didn’t have children, and where did she spend her summers?  Maine was good.  Running an art gallery was questionable, but since her father was an artist, it was forgivable.  His sister and brother spoke to her from time to time.  She felt like she’d been playing tennis all night by the time they finished dinner, and she collapsed in her room for a minute, before they went to church again.  They were so much more impressive than she had expected, and being face to face with them was even dicier than she had imagined.  Particularly his mother.  The thought of his mother in the same room with hers made her feel faint.  It was a frightening prospect that meant that if she ever married him, they’d have to elope.  There would have been no way to have her family and his under one roof, let alone at a wedding.  Only Avery would have passed muster.  Her father was much too racy and unconventional too.  He hadn’t gone to Harvard, he hated sports, and knew nothing about football.  And introducing her mother to this very proper conservative group was out of the question.  They were as white-bread, pure, holy, church-going, and athletic as it got.  And they were successful, social, and important on top of it.  There didn’t seem to be one rebel in the group, except Chris, who was a renegade by their standards and no one else’s.\r\n Chris burst out laughing when he saw her sprawled out on her bed before church, looking like she’d run a marathon, and exhausted.  She had ten potential outfits spread out on her bed for upcoming events.\r\n “Having fun yet?”  he teased her.  “Don’t mind my mother.  She’s a little like Scylla and Charybdis, or whoever they have posted at the gates of Hell these days, but when you get past her and she gives you her seal of approval, you can pretty much do what you want.  All you have to do is show up for meals on time and not do anything to seriously annoy her.”\r\n “She’s your mother.  I don’t want to offend her.”  Francesca couldn’t remotely imagine ever getting his mother’s approval.\r\n “It’s rude to ask people that many questions.  She should be worried about offending\r\n you.  Start asking her stuff, like where she went to school.  She loves that.  She went to Vassar when it was an all-girl school.  She’s very proud of it.”  It was an easy entree to a benign conversation with her.\r\n “I’ve never been to church twice in one day in my life,” Francesca said with a look of desperation.  “If God sees me there, He’ll throw me out, and the whole congregation will be hit by lightning.”  He laughed, grateful for her patience.\r\n “It’s good for you.  Brownie points in Heaven,” he said, as he pulled her off the bed.  “Speaking of which, I’m sorry to do this to you, but it’s time to leave for church.”  There were twenty of them going to midnight mass.  Francesca couldn’t remember their names or who they were, except his siblings, with whom she had nothing in common.  They were just Harleys to her, en masse.  The only one who stood out to her was Chris.  She was almost angry at him for bringing her here, but staying home alone in New York would have been depressing too, and she loved him.  So here she was, on her way to church again, for the second time that day.  Her father would have laughed, and even her mother would have been amused.  Thalia hadn’t even gone to church for her last three weddings.\r\n Francesca dozed off in church during the homily.  And afterward they all went back to the house, and then mercifully everyone went to bed.  The vice patrol in the form of his mother said goodnight and went to her room after wishing everyone a merry Christmas, with the emphasis on the “Christmas,” not the “merry.”  Francesca noticed that no one kissed, and fathers and sons shook hands.  There were no bear hugs in this group.\r\n Chris was in Francesca’s room half an hour later.  She was thirty-five years old, and she felt fourteen and like a juvenile delinquent.  She was afraid to wind up in juvenile hall, or detention, or jail.\r\n “Merry Christmas, baby,” he said as he kissed her then, and he handed her a box he had carried in his jacket.  It was a long slim box from Tiffany’s, and when she opened it, she saw that it was a gold bracelet with hearts on it.  He put it on her arm and kissed her.  She had bought a gray cashmere scarf for him, and he loved it too.\r\n She was relieved that she only had two more days to get through.  But the next day was better because it was Christmas.  They had present opening, a big meal, with the table set for thirty, with the children at the table in the hall again, the girls in velvet dresses.  There was touch football outside afterward on the frozen ground, from which she was exempt because she was a girl.  And then they all drank hot toddies and sat around the fire.  Chris’s mother played bridge with her husband, her daughter, and one of her nieces.  And Chris sat next to the fire with her.  Ian was playing upstairs somewhere with the other kids.  And by midnight she was back in her room with Chris.  Only one more day to go, and then they could leave.  She could hardly wait.\r\n “Are you having fun?”  “Yes,” she lied, “but I’m scared all the time that I’m going to do the wrong thing.  I\r\n feel like a kid.”  That part was the truth.  “You just have to ignore them.  They think they created the world, but they didn’t.\r\n That’s why I only come home twice a year.  And it’s better at the Vineyard.  It’s more relaxed.”  He was well aware that his family could drive most people insane.  They were major overachievers in everything they did, and expected everyone else to be too, and conform to all of their rules.  He hadn’t in years, but no longer confronted them about it.  He just led his own life, he always had.  But he liked coming home for Christmas, for all the traditions, and was grateful she had come with him.  He knew this wasn’t easy for her, to be constantly scrutinized.  He readily admitted to her that his family lived in a cookie- cutter world, where everyone was the same and all the pieces fit.  She came from a world where nothing fit, neither her mother nor her father.  One was outrageous and the other was artistic and eccentric.  But both she and Chris were their own people, independent of their parents’ ideas and lives.\r\n “Your mother would have a stroke if she ever met my parents,” Francesca said ruefully.\r\n “Yes, she would,” he agreed.  “But, so what?  I don’t approve of my parents either.  They live an incredibly limited life and they bore me to tears.”  At least he agreed with her about it, but she didn’t want to be rude about his family.  They were decent, respectable people.  She just felt ill at ease and off-kilter in their midst.  She didn’t fit.  But neither did Chris.  She was comforted by that.\r\n He slept in her bed again that night, and was gone before seven, and he had breakfast with his mother again. "

There's\r\n nothing to eat around here.\r\n\r\n Guess what.\r\n Warner just called.\r\n\r\n He wants to meet me\r\n at the development site.\r\n\r\n Kevin says, if this\r\n goes well, I should...\r\n\r\n Did you just read\r\n that whole book?\r\n\r\n I read all of these books.\r\n\r\n What's wrong?\r\n\r\n What's wrong?\r\n Where should I start?\r\n\r\n Uh, why is there so much\r\n injustice in the world?\r\n\r\n Why do some have so much\r\n while so many have so little?\r\n\r\n Why are children in Compton\r\n getting fatter and fatter\r\n\r\n whilst children in Beverly Hills\r\n\r\n are starving\r\n themselves to death?\r\n\r\n Why, Ryan?  Why?\r\n\r\n Uh...\r\n\r\n Jesus, put down the bong\r\n and pick up a book.\r\n\r\n \"Critique of Pure Reason\"\r\n by Immanuel Kant.\r\n\r\n Ever heard of this Kant?\r\n\r\n I love Kant.\r\n\r\n Oh, existential\r\n German philosophy\r\n\r\n is funny to you.\r\n\r\n Wipe that smirk off your face\r\n and listen to this Kant.\r\n\r\n \"It is not the consequences\r\n of the action\r\n\r\n \"which make it right or wrong,\r\n\r\nbut the motivation of the\r\n individual performing the act.\"\r\n\r\n What do you suppose that means?\r\n\r\n I don't know.\r\n\r\n Uh, you should never\r\n knowingly do bad to others.\r\n\r\n Yes.  And would that be an ethos\r\n\r\n with which you find\r\n not incompatible\r\n\r\n with your own beliefs?\r\n\r\n I'm-I'm not sure\r\n what you're asking.\r\n\r\n Because the most\r\n enlightening thing\r\n\r\n I read today\r\n was this prospectus.\r\n\r\n That new mall you're\r\n so determined to invest in?\r\n\r\n It will mean the destruction\r\n\r\n of an important\r\n public works program.\r\n\r\n What's the big deal?\r\n This place is a dump.\r\n\r\n This park keeps inner-city\r\n dogs off the streets.\r\n\r\n They rely on this park\r\n\r\n for the programs and\r\n services it offers,\r\n\r\n- like free water from the OWBP.\r\n - The what?\r\n\r\n The open water bowl project.\r\n\r\n Most of these dogs\r\n\r\n come from broken homes\r\n with broken fences.\r\n\r\n If you're party to the\r\n destruction of this park,\r\n\r\nthen you're no\r\n better than them.\r\n\r\n We'll talk about this later.\r\n\r\n Open your eyes, Ryan!\r\n\r\n Together, we can make\r\n a difference.\r\n\r\n - Sorry I'm late.\r\n - Hey, Ryan.\r\n\r\n Don't ever apologize\r\n for being late.\r\n\r\n It makes you sound\r\n poor, all right?\r\n\r\n It's my kid.\r\n Doesn't he have any friends?\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Excuse me for one second.\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Oh, hi, Ryan.\r\n\r\n How did you get\r\n the car doors unlocked?\r\n\r\n I read the manual.\r\n\r\n Excuse me, sir.\r\n\r\n Do you have 30 seconds\r\n to help save the world?\r\n\r\n Have a nice day.\r\n Hope your children enjoy\r\n\r\n the wasteland\r\n you're leaving them.\r\n\r\n Wilfred, get back in the car\r\n\r\n before you blow\r\n this deal for me.\r\n\r\n Look, I'm sorry,\r\nbut I can't ignore\r\n\r\n what's right in front of me.\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Hear our bark!\r\n Save this park!\r\n\r\n Everything okay, Ryan?\r\n\r\n Here they are,\r\nthe one-percent\r\n\r\n here to profit\r\n off the k-99%!\r\n\r\n Let's get 'em, boys!\r\n\r\n Sorry, my dog got out\r\n of the car.\r\n\r\n You hear that?\r\n\r\n I will not be contained,\r\ncorporate pigs!\r\n\r\n All right, brass tacks.\r\n Minimum buy-in's $10,000.\r\n\r\n Wait.  So, does that mean...?\r\n\r\n Yeah.  You're in!\r\n\r\n I need an answer now.\r\n\r\n - We're signing the deal tomorrow.\r\n - Here's your answer.\r\n\r\n Whoa!  Hey, hey,\r\nRyan, your dog!\r\n\r\n - Wilfred!\r\n - In my mouth.\r\n\r\n What the hell are you thinking?\r\n What are you thinking?\r\n\r\n You're putting these dogs\r\n out on the street.\r\n\r\n Look, I know you're\r\n looking for something to do\r\n\r\n now that you've lost\r\n your sense of smell...\r\n\r\n What I've lost\r\n in my sense of smell,\r\n\r\nI've gained\r\n in my sense of humanity.\r\n\r\n And now I'm appealing to yours.\r\n\r\n I'm trying to do\r\n the right thing here,\r\n\r\nbut I can't do it alone.\r\n\r\n Wilfred, I'm trying\r\n to be responsible\r\n\r\n and plan for my future.\r\n\r\n To hell with the future!\r\n I need you right now!\r\n\r\n Ryan, I really care about this.\r\n\r\n I need you to care, too.\r\n\r\n The only thing I'm signing\r\n\r\n is that investment\r\n agreement tomorrow.\r\n\r\n Ryan...\r\n\r\n Ryan!\r\n\r\n Ryan.\r\n\r\n What are you doing down here\r\n in the dark?\r\n\r\n There's darkness\r\n everywhere, Ryan.\r\n\r\n You just can't see it\r\n\r\n because the sun\r\n is such an attention whore.\r\n\r\n Jesus!\r\n\r\n What is the matter with you?\r\n\r\n Are you still mad\r\n\r\n because I didn't sign\r\n your little petition?\r\n\r\n - Get over it.\r\n - Why would I be mad?\r\n\r\n Uncaring, unfeeling.\r\n\r\n Seven billion narcissists\r\n all alone together\r\n\r\n on a big, dead rock.\r\n\r\n What's the point of anything?\r\n\r\n Life reeks of hopelessness.\r\n\r\n I'm just glad I can't\r\n smell it anymore.\r\n\r\n Camus, Sylvia Plath,\r\nMarley and Me.\r\n\r\n Maybe you should stop reading.\r\n\r\n Do you know what\r\n I dreamt last night?\r\n\r\n Nothing.\r\n\r\n I have to meet Warner\r\n in an hour.\r\n\r\n Have you seen my checkbook?\r\n\r\n I can't find it anywhere.\r\n\r\n So nice to see you so\r\n concerned about something.\r\n\r\n Look, when we get back,\r\nmaybe we can go for a walk.\r\n\r\n A walk.\r\n\r\n Such a futile exercise.\r\n\r\n Let's go for... hang on.\r\n\r\n Let's go for a walk\r\n around the block.\r\n\r\n Around and around and\r\n around in circles\r\n\r\n on a meaningless journey to...\r\n\r\n - Are you done?\r\n - Yes.\r\n\r\n Let's go.\r\n\r\n I don't want to be late.\r\n I'm not going anywhere.\r\n\r\n Fine.
