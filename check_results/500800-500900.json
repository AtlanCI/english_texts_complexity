        "text":" \"Oh, something like, 'Charming boy — poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable.  Quite forget what he does — afraid he —  doesn't do anything — oh, yes, plays the piano — or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?'  Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.\"\r\n \"Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,\" said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\r\n Hallward shook his head.  \"You don't understand what friendship is, Harry,\" he murmured — \"or what enmity is, for that matter.  You like every one;  that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.\"\r\n \"How horribly unjust of you!\"  cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky.  \"Yes;  horribly unjust of you.  I make a great difference between people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.  A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.  I have not got one who is a fool.  They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me.  Is that very vain of me?  I think it is rather vain.\"\r\n \"I should think it was, Harry.  But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.\"\r\n \"My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.\"\r\n \"And much less than a friend.  A sort of brother, I suppose?\"\r\n \"Oh, brothers!  I don't care for brothers.  My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.\"\r\n \"Harry!\"  exclaimed Hallward, frowning. %\r\n \"My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can't help detesting my relations.  I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders.  The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves.  When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent.  And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly.\"\r\n \"I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either.\"\r\n Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane.  \"How English you are Basil!  That is the second time you have made that observation.  If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman — always a rash thing to do — he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.  The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself.  Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.  However, I don't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.  I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.  Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.  How often do you see him?\" %\r\n \"Every day.  I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.  He is absolutely necessary to me.\"\r\n \"How extraordinary!  I thought you would never care for anything but your art.\"\r\n \"He is all my art to me now,\" said the painter gravely.  \"I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history.  The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.  What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him.  Of course, I have done all that.  But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.  I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it.  There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.  But in some curious way — I wonder will you understand me?  — his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see things differently, I think of them differently.  I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before.  ' A dream of form in days of thought' — who is it who says that?  I forget;  but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad — for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty —  his merely visible presence — ah!  I wonder can you realize all that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.  The harmony of soul and body —  how much that is!  We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.  Harry!  if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!  You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?  It is one of the best things I have ever done.  And why is it so?  Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.  Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.\"\r\n \"Basil, this is extraordinary!  I must see Dorian Gray.\"\r\n Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.  After some time he came back.  \"Harry,\" he said, \"Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art.  You might see nothing in him.  I see everything in him.  He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.  He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours.  That is all.\"\r\n \"Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?\"  asked Lord Henry.\r\n \"Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to speak to him.  He knows nothing about it.  He shall never know anything about it.  But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes.  My heart shall never be put under their microscope.  There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry — too much of myself!\"\r\n \"Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.  They know how useful passion is for publication.  Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.\"\r\n \"I hate them for it,\" cried Hallward.  \"An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.  We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.  We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.  Some day I will show the world what it is;  and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.\"\r\n \"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you.  It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?\"\r\n The painter considered for a few moments.  \"He likes me,\" he answered after a pause;  \"I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him dreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said.  As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.\"\r\n \"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,\" murmured Lord Henry.  \"Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.  The thoroughly well-informed man- -that is the modern ideal.  And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.  It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.  I think you will tire first, all the same.  Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something.  You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.  The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.  What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.\"\r\n \"Harry, don't talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.  You can't feel what I feel.  You change too often.\"\r\n \"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\"  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.  There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.  How pleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other people's emotions were!  —  much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him.  One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends — those were the fascinating things in life.  He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. "

        "text":"“I was focused rather closely myself,” Chronicler said, standing up and stretching.  “What time is it?”\r\n “Late,” Bast said.  “I’m hungry.”\r\n Chronicler looked out the dark window into the street.  “I’d have thought you’d have had at least a few folks in for dinner by now.  You pulled a good crowd for lunch.”\r\n Kvothe nodded.  “We would’ve seen a few of my regulars if not for Shep’s funeral.”\r\n “Ah.”  Chronicler looked down.  “I’d forgotten.  Is that something I’ve kept you two from attending?”\r\n Kvothe lit the last lamp behind the bar and blew out his candle.  “Not really,” he said.  “Bast and I aren’t from around these parts.  And they’re practical folk.  They know I have a business to run, such as it is.”\r\n “And you don’t get along with Abbe Leodin,” Bast said.\r\n “And I don’t get along with the local priest,” Kvothe admitted.  “But you should make an appearance, Bast.  It will seem odd if you don’t.”\r\n Bast’s eyes darted around nervously.  “I don’t want to leave, Reshi.”\r\n Kvothe smiled warmly at him.  “You should, Bast.  Shep was a good man, go have a drink to send him off.  In fact . .  .”  He bent and rummaged around under the bar for a moment before coming up with a bottle.  “Here.  A fine old bottle of brand.  Better stuff than anyone around here asks for.  Go share it around.”  He set it on the bar with a solid sound.\r\n Bast took an involuntary step forward, his face conflicted.  “But Reshi, I . .  .”\r\n “Pretty girls dancing, Bast,” Kvothe said, his voice low and soothing.  “Someone on the fiddle and all of them just glad to be alive.  Kicking up their skirts to the music.  Laughing and a little tipsy.  Their cheeks all rosy and ready to be kissed. . .  .”  He gave the heavy brown bottle a nudge, and it slid down the bar toward his student.  “You’re my ambassador to the town.  I may be stuck minding the shop, but you can be there and make my apologies.”\r\n Bast closed his hand around the neck of the bottle.  “I’ll have one drink,” he said, his voice thick with resolve.  “And one dance.  And one kiss with Katie Miller.  And maybe another with the Widow Creel.  But that’s all.”  He looked Kvothe in the eye.  “I’ll only be gone half an hour. . .  .”\r\n Kvothe gave a warm smile.  “I have things to tend to, Bast.  I’ll cobble together dinner and we’ll give our friend’s hand a bit of a rest.”\r\n Bast grinned and picked up the bottle.  “Two dances then!”  He bolted for the door, and when he opened it the wind gusted around him, swirling his hair wildly.  “Save me something to eat!”  He shouted over his shoulder.\r\n The door banged shut.\r\n Chronicler gave the innkeeper a curious look.\r\n Kvothe gave a small shrug.  “He was getting too tangled up in the story.  He can’t feel a thing halfway.  A little time away will give him some perspective.  Besides, I do have dinner to prepare, even if it’s only for three.”\r\n The scribe brought a grimy piece of cloth out of his leather satchel and looked at it with some distaste.  “I don’t suppose I could trouble you for a clean rag?”  he asked.\r\n Kvothe nodded and brought out a white linen cloth from beneath the bar.  “Is there anything else you need?”\r\n Chronicler stood and walked over to the bar.  “If you had some strong spirits it would be a great help,” he said, sounding slightly embarrassed.  “I hate to ask, but when I was robbed . .  .”\r\n Kvothe waved the comment away.  “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said.  “I should have asked you yesterday if there was anything you needed.”  He moved out from behind the bar toward the basement stairs.  “I’m assuming wood alcohol would work best?”\r\n Chronicler nodded, and Kvothe disappeared into the basement.  The scribe picked up the crisply folded square of linen and rubbed it idly between his fingers.  Then his eyes wandered up to the sword hanging high on the wall behind the bar.  The grey metal of the blade was striking against the dark wood of the mounting board.\r\n Kvothe came back up the steps carrying a small clear bottle.  “Is there anything else you need?  I have a good stock of paper and ink here too.”\r\n “It may come to that by tomorrow,” Chronicler said.  “I’ve used up most of my paper.  But I can grind more ink tonight.”\r\n “Don’t put yourself to the trouble,” Kvothe said easily.  “I have several bottles of fine Aruean ink.”\r\n “True Aruean ink?”  Chronicler asked, surprised.\r\n Kvothe gave a broad smile and nodded.\r\n “That’s terribly kind of you,” Chronicler said, relaxing a bit.  “I’ll admit I wasn’t looking forward to spending an hour grinding tonight.”  He gathered up the clear bottle and cloth, then paused.  “Would you mind if I asked you a question?  Unofficially, as it were?”\r\n A smirk curled the corner of Kvothe’s mouth.  “Very well then, unofficially.”\r\n “I can’t help notice that your description of Caesura doesn’t . .  .”  Chronicler hesitated.  “Well, it doesn’t quite seem to match the actual sword itself.”  His eyes flicked to the sword behind the bar.  “The hand guard isn’t what you described.”\r\n Kvothe gave a wide grin.  “Well you’re just sharp as anything, aren’t you?”\r\n “I don’t mean to imply — ” Chronicler said quickly, looking embarrassed.\r\n Kvothe laughed a rich warm laugh.  The sound of it tumbled around the room, and for a moment the inn didn’t feel empty at all.  “No.  You’re absolutely right.”  He turned to look at the sword.  “This isn’t . . .  what did the boy call it this morning?”  His eyes went distant for a moment, then he smiled again.  “Kaysera.  The poet killer.”\r\n “I was just curious,” Chronicler said apologetically.\r\n “Am I supposed to be offended that you’re paying attention?”  Kvothe laughed again.  “What fun is there in telling a story if nobody’s listening?”  He rubbed his hands together eagerly.  “Right then.  Dinner.  What would you like?  Hot or cold?  Soup or stew?  I’m a dab hand at pudding too.”\r\n They settled on something simple to avoid restoking the stove in the kitchen.  Kvothe moved briskly around the inn, gathering what was needed.  He hummed to himself as he fetched cold mutton and half a hard, sharp cheese from the basement.\r\n “These will be a nice surprise for Bast.”  Kvothe grinned at Chronicler as he brought out a jar of brined olives from the pantry.  “He can’t know we have them or he’d have eaten them already.”  He untied his apron, pulling it off over his head.  “I think we have a few tomatoes left in the garden too.”\r\n Kvothe returned after several minutes with his apron wrapped into a bundle.  He was spattered with rain and his hair was in wild disarray.  He wore a boyish grin, and at that moment he looked very little like the somber, slowmoving innkeeper.\r\n “It can’t quite decide if it wants to storm,” he said as he set his apron on the bar, carefully removing the tomatoes.  “But if it makes up its mind, we’re in for a wagon-tipper tonight.”  He began to hum absentmindedly while he cut and arranged everything on a broad wooden platter.\r\n The door of the Waystone opened and a sudden gust of wind made the lamplight flicker.  Two soldiers came in, hunched against the weather, their swords sticking out like tails behind them.  Dark spatters of rain spotted the fabric of their blue and white tabards.\r\n They dropped their heavy packs, and the shorter of the two pressed his shoulder to the door, forcing it closed against the wind.\r\n “God’s teeth,” said the taller one, straightening his clothes.  “It’s a bad night to be caught in the open.”  He was bald on top, with a thick black beard that was flat as a spade.  He looked at Kvothe, “Ho boy!”  he said cheerfully.  “We were glad to see your light.  Run and fetch the owner, would you?  We need to have a word with him.”\r\n Kvothe picked his apron up off the bar and ducked his head into it.  “That would be me,” he said, clearing his throat as he tied the strings around his waist.  He ran his hands through his tousled hair, smoothing it down.\r\n The bearded soldier peered at him, then shrugged.  “Fair enough.  Any chance of us getting a spot of dinner?”\r\n The innkeeper gestured to the empty room.  “It didn’t seem worth putting the kettle on tonight,” he said.  “But we’ve got what you see here.”\r\n The two soldiers strode to the bar.  The blonde one ran his hands through his curly hair, shaking a few drops of rain out of it.  “This town looks deader than ditchwater,” he said.  “We didn’t see a single light but this.”\r\n “Long harvest day,” the innkeeper said.  “And there’s a wake tonight at one of the nearby farms.  The four of us are probably the only folk in town right now.”  He rubbed his hands together briskly.  “Can I interest you fine folk in a drink to take off the chill?”  He brought out a bottle of wine and sat it on the bar with a solid, satisfying sound.\r\n “Well that’s a difficulty,” the blonde soldier said with a bit of an embarrassed smile.  “I’d dearly love a drink, but my friend and I just took the king’s coin.”  He reached into his pocket and brought out a bright gold coin.  “This is all the money I have on me.  I don’t suppose you have enough to break a whole royal, would you?”\r\n “I’m stuck with mine too,” the bearded soldier groused.  “Most money I’ve ever had, but it don’t spend well in a lump.  Most of the towns we’ve been through could barely make change for ha’penny.”  He chuckled at his own joke.\r\n “I should be able to help you out with that,” the innkeeper said easily.\r\n The two soldiers exchanged a look.  The blonde one nodded.\r\n “Right then.”  The blonde soldier put the coin back in his pocket.  “Here’s the truth.  We aren’t really going to be stopping for the night.”  He picked up a piece of cheese off the bar and took a bite.  “And we aren’t going to be paying for anything either.”\r\n “Ah,” the innkeeper said.  “I see.”\r\n “And if you’ve got enough money in your purse to change out two gold royals,” the bearded one said eagerly, “then we’ll have that off you as well.”\r\n The blonde soldier spread his hands in a calming gesture.  “Now this don’t need to be any sort of ugly thing.  We aren’t bad folk.  You pass over your purse and we go on our way.  No folk get hurt, and nothing gets wrecked.  It’s bound to sting a bit.”  He raised an eyebrow at the innkeeper.  “But a little sting beats hell out of getting yourself killed.  Am I right?”\r\n"

My friends, today is a unique moment in time both for my country and for FIFA.  Russia represents new horizons for FIFA.  Russia means a big promotion of our game.  Millions of new hearts and minds.  It also means a great legacy of the World Cup: great new stadiums and millions of boys and girls embracing a game.  Russia’s economy is large and growing.  The Federal Government has stable finances.  Russia’s sport marketing is developing rapidly.  Just one example.  Today Russian companies provided over one billion dollars in sponsorship for the Sochi Olympic Games.  Imagine how much investment would be made into football.  Give it that football is sport number one.  Our bit is a national priority for the Russian Federation.  If you give us a chance, FIFA will never regret it.  You will be proud of your choice.  I guarantee.  I also promise in 2018 I’ll speak English like my friend Jack Thompson.  Dear friends, you can see all the map.  Western Europe hosted the World Cup many times.  Yet Eastern Europe never had the chance.  Many years ago the Berlin Wall was destroyed.  A new era for the world begins.  Today we can break another symbolic wall and open a new era in football together.  Thank you very much my friends."

        "text":"Companies’ pricing decisions depend on one or more of three basic factors: production and distribution costs, the level of demand, and the prices (or probable prices) of current and potential competitors.  Companies also consider their overall objectives and their consequent profit or sales targets, such as seeking maximum revenue, or maximum market share, etc.  Pricing strategy must also consider market positioning: quality products generally require “prestige pricing” and will probably not sell if their price is thought to be too low.  \r\n Obviously, firms with excess production capacity, a large inventory, or a falling market share, tend to cut prices.  Firms experiencing cost inflation, or in urgent need of cash, tend to raise prices.  A company faced with demand that exceeds its possibility to supply is also likely to raise its prices.  \r\n When sales respond directly to price variations, demand is said to be elastic.  If sales remain stable after a change in price, demand is inelastic.  Although it is an elementary law of economics that the lower the price, the greater the sales, there are numerous exceptions.  For example, price cuts can have unpredictable psychological effects: buyers may believe that the product is faulty or of lower quality, or will soon be replaced, or that the firm is going bankrupt, etc.  Similarly, price rises convince some consumers that the product must be of high quality, or will soon become very hard to get hold of, and so on!  \r\n A psychological effect that many retailers count on is that a potential customer seeing a price of £499 will register the £400 price range rather than the £500.  This technique is known as “odd pricing”.  \r\n Obviously most customers consider elements other than price when buying something: the “total cost” of a product can include operating and servicing costs, and so on.  Since price is only one element of the marketing mix, a company can respond to a competitor’s price cut by modifying other elements: improving its product, service, communications, etc.  Reciprocal price cuts may only lead to a price war, good for customers but disastrous for producers who merely end up losing money.  \r\n Whatever pricing strategies a marketing department  selects, a product’s selling price generally represents its total cost (unit cost plus overheads) plus profit or “risk reward”.  Overheads are the various expenses of operating a plant that cannot be charged to any one product, process or department, which have to be added to prime cost or direct cost which covers material and labour."

        "text":"Introduction\r\n\r\n Bubbles, such as the ones produced from soap, is made of a thin film.  It is possible to make a bubble using the Colloid solution.  The soap film is transparent so it is subject to reflection.  Light will create specular reflection on one section and will pass through other sections.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, Colloid has a Tyndall Effect. \r\n\r\n (water, colloid) \r\n\r\n If the reflection on the surface can be controlled, then there is a possibility of using the bubble as a display.\r\n\r\n Using ultrasonic sounds, the surface's reflective characteristics can be changed. \r\n\r\n (membrane, ultrasonic)\r\n\r\n BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) and transparency are controlled by ultrasonic sounds.\r\n\r\n (the bubble, projected texture)\r\n\r\n\r\n Design\r\n\r\n (ultrasonic speakers, colloidal liquid, membrane)\r\n (sugar, glyserin, soap, surfactant, water, milk)\r\n\r\n Bubble made out of Colloid that is not easily popped.  Sound waves from the high frequency speaker can be controlled. \r\n\r\n (controllable transparency)\r\n\r\n Films are made automatically by this machine.  It can be used as a very thin transparent screen with a controllable surface. \r\n\r\n\r\n Application: Material screen, 3D screen, Flexible display\r\n\r\n Since high frequency sound waves are used to control the refection of the lights, the surface's material will appear different. \r\n\r\n Zoomed in view of the surfaces change.\r\n\r\n (metal, a jewel beetle, fish, carpet, wood, a stone wall, condensaion, a section of a stone, the Earth)\r\n\r\n Sample textures.\r\n\r\n 3D screen (multiple screen).  Multiple screens can be shown from one direction by alternating the images and the transparencies.  It can create dimensional representation.  Objects can pass through the screen. \r\n\r\n (face, ball, finger)\r\n\r\n Alpha (transparency) & other use. \r\n\r\n (contrallable screen's movement)\r\n\r\n Because the screen is transparent, the earth will look as if it is floating.   The film can be used on polygons.  The user can display images freely on the transparent screen by moving the speaker in the hand. \r\n\r\n (ultrasonic speaker, a ring, a hand)\r\n\r\n =====================================\r\n\r\n A Colloidal Display membrane screen that combines transparency, BRDF and 3D volume (2012)\r\n\r\n Yoichi Ochiai (University of Tokyo)\r\n Alexis Oyama (Carnegie Mellon University)\r\n Keisuke Toyoshima (University of Tsukuba)\r\n\r\n http://96ochiai.ws/colloidaldisplay\r\n\r\n The Colloidal Display proposes an innovative solution which transforms a soap film into the world's thinnest screen.  This screen's transparency, texture, and shape can be controlled dynamically by using ultrasonic sound waves.  The screen's unique material, which allows objects to pass through, promotes new ways of interaction.\r\n\r\n It is a common knowledge that the surface of soap bubble is a micro membrane.  It allows light to pass through and displays the color on its structure.  We developed an ultra thin and flexible BRDF screen using the mixture of two colloidal liquids.  There have been several researches on dynamic BRDF display in the past.  However, our work is different in several points.  Our membrane screen can be controlled using ultrasonic vibrations.  Membrane can change its transparency and surface states depending on the scales of ultrasonic waves.  Based on these facts, we developed several applications of the membranes such as 3D volume screen.\r\n\r\n The combination of the ultrasonic waves and ultra thin membranes makes more realistic, distinctive, and vivid imageries on screen.  This system contributes to open up a new path for display engineering with sharp imageries, transparency, BDRF and flexibility.\r\n\r\n This project is patent pending and submitted."
