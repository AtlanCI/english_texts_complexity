        "text":"English at Work\r\n Episode 22: The smoker\r\n Language for making a polite request\r\n\r\n Narrator: Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where Anna is going downstairs to speak to warehouse manager, Mr Ingle.  You’re looking a bit nervous…\r\n\r\n Anna: I am.  Denise says if I speak to him in the wrong way, he might bite my head off!\r\n\r\n Narrator: Relax Anna.  It’s just an expression to mean he might be a bit aggressive.\r\n\r\n Anna: Oh!\r\n\r\n Narrator: You’ll be fine, just use the right polite phrases… oh, and smile!\r\n\r\n Anna: OK, I will.  Oh look I’m here now…\r\n (Warehouse door opens)\r\n\r\n Anna: Mr Ingle, are you there?  I’d be most grateful if you could give me some… oh, what’s that smell… and smoke… Mr Ingle!\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Oh, oh (coughs)\r\n\r\n Anna: Mr Ingle.  You’re smoking!\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Well… it’s my lunch break… so I’m allowed a cigarette, aren’t I?\r\n\r\n Anna: Really?  Are you sure?\r\n\r\n Narrator: No, he’s not Anna!  Smoking in a public place is illegal – it’s against the law.  It’s dangerous too - you’ve got to do something about this.\r\n\r\n Anna: Oh right.  Mmm, er, Mr Ingle, you mustn’t smoke… it’s wrong.\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Says who?\r\n\r\n Anna: Err, Me?\r\n\r\n Narrator: Anna.  You’ll have to do better than that.  Be polite, but be firm too.  Try saying, ‘would you mind not doing that please?’\r\n\r\n Anna: I’ll try.  Mr Ingle, would you mind not doing that please?\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Why’s that then?\r\n\r\n Narrator: He’s not being very nice is he?  You need to give your reasons.  Say, ‘I’m afraid it’s against company policy’… go on you can do it.\r\n\r\n Anna: Mr Ingle… I’m afraid it’s against company policy.  And… it is actually against the law to smoke here… and… it’s not a nice smell, is it?\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: It smells OK to me.\r\n\r\n Anna: Well, I’m sorry to have to ask you this but you need to put it out.\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Put what out – the cat?!\r\n\r\n Anna: No.  You need to extinguish your cigarette… please.\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Says who?\r\n\r\n Anna: Well, I’m sure your team wouldn’t like to see you breaking the law and besides, it could cause a fire.  That would be awful.\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Yeah, I suppose it would.\r\n\r\n Anna: I could get you some nicotine gum if you like?\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: No, it’s OK.  I’ll stub it out… as you asked so nicely.\r\n\r\n Anna: Thank you Mr Ingle.  We’ll keep it a secret this time, but please don’t do it again.  I’m afraid it’s just not permitted on company premises.\r\n\r\n Mr Ingle: Whatever!\r\n\r\n Anna: Oh and Mr Ingle, I still really like your overalls.  Bye!\r\n\r\n Narrator: Nice one Anna.  You dealt with Mr Ingle really well.  You kept your cool and explained the reasons why he shouldn’t smoke.  Let’s hope he doesn’t do it again Anna.\r\n\r\n Anna: I hope not.  I hate the smell of cigarette smoke.  But I never got to ask him about stock management.\r\n\r\n Narrator: Well, maybe it’s best to leave it for another time?\r\n Anna’s had a tricky day so far dealing with Mr Ingle but she was firm and fair in the language she used.  Here’s a reminder of the phrases she used:\r\nWould you mind not doing that please?\r\n I’m afraid it’s against company policy.\r\n I’m afraid it’s not permitted.\r\n Sorry to have to ask you this but…\r\n\r\n Paul: Ah Anna, there you are….  (sniffing) Have you been smoking?\r\n\r\n Anna: No!\r\n\r\n Paul: You smell of cigarette smoke.  Look, I know you’re under pressure – but smoking in the building is not permitted.\r\n\r\n Anna: Bbbut…\r\n\r\n Paul: We take this very seriously.  You had better step in to my office and we’ll talk about this.\r\n\r\n Narrator: Oh dear!  Anna’s in trouble for no reason.  Let’s hope she explains the mix-up, but that means telling Paul about Mr Ingle smoking.  This is going to be difficult.  Until next time, bye!\r\n\r\n Listening Challenge\r\n What other word does Anna use to mean ‘put out your cigarette’?\r\n (Answer: To extinguish)"

        "text":"What do we want from design?  Many thousands of words have been written on the subject, but to boil it down to bare essentials, every design project should fulfill its function, while also being responsible, ethically and environmentally, and desirable.\r\n Sounds simple.  Yet very few projects combine all three qualities.  Whether because of budgetary pressures, production problems, lack of imagination or old-fashioned incompetence, one of the three is often sacrificed, usually desirability or responsibility.\r\n\r\n Nonetheless, some projects do manage to be both responsible and desirable.  Here are some recent examples, together with a couple of others that exhibit one of those qualities, but arguably not the other.  Needless to say, they all fulfill their functions, otherwise they wouldn’t be worth considering at all.\r\n\r\n 1.  Responsible and desirable?\r\n\r\n The spa.  When the Barking Bathhouse opens Friday, the residents of Barking, an economically depressed suburb of East London, will be treated to a new community spa, developed by the eco-social design group Something & Son.  Built on the site of a derelict pub, it consists of 10 darkened, prefabricated timber pods, reminiscent of farm buildings in nearby Essex and beach huts in Kent.  Open until the autumn, the bathhouse, which is financed by the Create arts program, will contain massage and treatment rooms, a hot sauna, an ice room, a bar and a shingle beach.\r\n\r\n Conceived as a contemporary take on 19th-century public baths, the Barking Bathhouse is definitely desirable, and also responsible, particularly with regard to its efforts to engage with the local community.  Treatments will be provided by local masseurs, manicurists and other specialists, thereby giving them the chance to meet future clients.  Local residents can use the spa at a discount, paying £2 each, or about $3, compared with £8 for everyone else.  The food in the bar will be made from produce grown in nearby gardens and allotments, as will the products used for treatments.\r\n\r\n Something & Son has also tried to minimize the bathhouse’s environmental impact.  Recycled materials were used wherever possible, including old railway sleepers for the foundations, scaffolding boards for interior walls and second-hand furniture.  To save energy, the sauna and ice room are heavily insulated, and the former is heated by a wood-burning stove.  And when the bathhouse closes in the autumn, the pods will slide off the sleepers before being taken away to be reused elsewhere.\r\n\r\n The Wi-Fi shelter.  Across the English Channel in Paris, the latest project by the French designer Mathieu Lehanneur shares the Barking Bathhouse’s ecological objectives and community focus, but there the similarities end.  Commissioned by the street furniture company J.C. Decaux, Escale Numérique, or Digital Break, as it is called in English, is a sleekly technocratic urban shelter on the Rond-point des Champs-Elysées in Paris where passersby can rest, chat, escape from the rain and log on to the Internet.\r\n\r\n Made from wood, aluminum and concrete, it is furnished with swivel chairs sporting laptop rests and Wi-Fi sockets, and a giant touch screen relaying information about Paris.  The shelter is topped by a green roof, which counters the environmental damage caused by the loss of greenery in cities like Paris, while providing something attractive for people to look at while walking past or peering down from nearby buildings.\r\n\r\n The brush.  Not that responsibility and desirability are the preserve of iconoclasts like Something & Son and Mr. Lehanneur, as the venerable Italian company Acca Kappa has proved by developing the Bioceta range of biodegradable brushes.  Founded in Treviso, near Venice, in 1869, Acca Kappa has made luxurious hairbrushes ever since and is still run by the same family.  Its Bioceta brushes are as pleasing to look at and touch as the traditional ones, but are made from a natural resin, made of wood and cotton byproducts, that decomposes naturally.\r\n\r\n 2.  Responsible but not desirable?\r\n\r\n The smartphone.  The world’s phone makers are not known for their commitment to sustainability, but the South Korean company Samsung tries harder than most to be environmentally responsible.  The new Samsung Galaxy Exhilarate smartphone has been certified Platinum, the highest possible rating, by UL Environment, a U.S. environmental standards organization.  Made from 80 percent recycled materials, it has a biodegradable case and charger that helps you avoid wasting electricity by telling you when the device is fully charged.  The Exhilarate is also relatively inexpensive, starting at $49.99, or €41, in the United States.\r\n\r\n Impressive though those achievements are, sadly, the Exhilarate’s styling doesn’t meet the same standards, especially the less than desirable design of its digital interface, which is the techie term for the words and symbols that flash up on the screen.\r\n\r\n 3.  Desirable but not responsible?\r\n\r\n The computer.  Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder but, personally, I not only consider Apple’s new notebook computer, the MacBook Pro with Retina display, to be beautiful, but to have other desirable qualities, too.  Admirably slender and light, it is just 0.71 inches, or 1.8 centimeters, thick, weighs 4.46 pounds, or two kilograms, and its screen has, in Apple’s words, the “highest-resolution display ever on a notebook.”\r\n\r\n But is it responsible?  The news a couple weeks ago that Apple had withdrawn from the electronic industry’s environmental rating system, the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or Epeat, sparked a flood of complaints from customers and fueled speculation that the new MacBook Pro had failed to meet Epeat’s recycling standards.  A week later, Apple issued an official admission that it had made a mistake, while announcing that it was rejoining Epeat, which had given the MacBook Pro a Gold6 rating.\r\n\r\n Embarrassing though the kerfuffle was, Apple was sensible to admit defeat, particularly as the fracas came so soon after the controversy over the employment practices of its Chinese subcontractors.  And, just in case Apple or any other company had lingering doubts, the Epeat debacle also proved that consumers do expect design to deliver both responsibility and desirability, not one or the other."

        "text":"How do you explain when things don't go as we assume?  Or better, how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions?  For example: Why is Apple so innovative?Year after year, after year, after year, they're more innovative than all their competition.  And yet, they're just a computer company.  They're just like everyone else.  They have the same access to the same talent, the same agencies, the same consultants, the same media.  Then why is it that they seem to have something different?  Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement?  He wasn't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America, and he certainly wasn't the only great orator of the day.  Why him?  And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded ...and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it.  There's something else at play here.\r\n\r\n About three and a half years ago I made a discovery.  And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.  As it turns out, there's a pattern.  As it turns out, all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world —whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers —they all think, act and communicate the exact same way.  And it's the complete opposite to everyone else.  All I did was codify it, and it's probably the world's simplest idea.  I call it the golden circle.\r\n\r\n Why?  How?  What?  This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren't.  Let me define the terms really quickly.  Every single person, every single organization on the planet knows what they do, 100 percent.  Some know how they do it, whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP.  But very, very few people or organizations know why they do what they do.  And by \"why\" I don't mean \"to make a profit.\"  That's a result.  It's always a result.  By \"why,\" I mean: What's your purpose?  What's your cause?  What's your belief?  Why does your organization exist?  Why do you get out of bed in the morning?  And why should anyone care?  Well, as a result, the way we think, the way we act, the way we communicate is from the outside in.  It's obvious.  We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing.  But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations — regardless of their size, regardless of their industry — all think, act and communicate from the inside out.\r\n\r\n Let me give you an example.  I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.  If Apple were like everyone else, a marketing message from them might sound like this: \"We make great computers.  They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.  Want to buy one?\"  \"Meh.\"  And that's how most of us communicate.  That's how most marketing is done, that's how most sales is done and that's how most of us communicate interpersonally.  We say what we do, we say how we're different or how we're better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.  Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients who do business with us.  Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats, buy our car.  But it's uninspiring.\r\n\r\n Here's how Apple actually communicates.  \"Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo.  We believe in thinking differently.  The way we challenge the status quois by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user friendly.  We just happen to make great computers.  Want to buy one?\"  Totally different right?  You're ready to buy a computer from me.  All I did was reverse the order of the information.  What it proves to us is that people don't buy what you do;  people buy why you do it.  People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it.\r\n\r\n This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.  But we're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple, or a DVR from Apple.  But, as I said before, Apple's just a computer company.  There's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors.  Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products.  In fact, they tried.  A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat screen TVs.  They're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs.  They've been making flat screen monitors for years.  Nobody bought one.  Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs, and they make great quality products, and they can make perfectly well-designed products — and nobody bought one.  In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell.  Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company?  But we do it every day.  People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it.  The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have.The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.  Here's the best part:\r\n\r\nNone of what I'm telling you is my opinion.  It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.  Not psychology, biology.  If you look at a cross-section of the human brain, looking from the top down, what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.  Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain, our neocortex, corresponds with the \"what\" level.  The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language.  The middle two sections make up our limbic brains, and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings, like trust and loyalty.  It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.\r\n\r\n In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures.  It just doesn't drive behavior.  When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.  This is where gut decisions come from.  You know, sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, \"I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right.\"  Why would we use that verb, it doesn't \"feel\" right?  Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn't control language.  And the best we can muster up is, \"I don't know.  It just doesn't feel right.\"  Or sometimes you say you're leading with your heart, or you're leading with your soul.  Well, I hate to break it to you, those aren't other body parts controlling your behavior.  It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.\r\n\r\n But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do.  Again, the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;  the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.  The goal is not just to hire people who need a job;  it's to hire people who believe what you believe.  I always say that, you know, if you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money, but if you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.  And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers.\r\n\r\n Most people don't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley.  And back in the early 20th century, the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.  Everybody was trying it.  And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume, to be the recipe for success.  I mean, even now, you ask people, \"Why did your product or why did your company fail?\"  and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things: under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.  It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.  Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine.  Money was no problem.  He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;  he knew all the big minds of the day.  He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic.  The New York Times followed him around everywhere, and everyone was rooting for Langley.  Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?\r\n\r\n A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio, Orville and Wilbur Wright, they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success.They had no money;  they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop;  not a single person on the Wright brothers' team had a college education, not even Orville or Wilbur;  and The New York Times followed them around nowhere.  The difference was, Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause, by a purpose, by a belief.  They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine, it'll change the course of the world.  Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.  He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.  He was in pursuit of the result.  He was in pursuit of the riches.  And lo and behold, look what happened.  The people who believed in the Wright brothers' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears.The others just worked for the paycheck.  And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out, they would have to take five sets of parts, because that's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper.\r\n\r\n And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903, the Wright brothers took flight, and no one was there to even experience it.  We found out about it a few days later.  And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing: The day the Wright brothers took flight, he quit.  He could have said, \"That's an amazing discovery, guys, and I will improve upon your technology,\" but he didn't.  He wasn't first, he didn't get rich, he didn't get famous so he quit.\r\n\r\n People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it.  And if you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.  But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe?Something called the law of diffusion of innovation, and if you don't know the law, you definitely know the terminology.The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators.  The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters.  The next 34 percent are your early majority, your late majority and your laggards.  The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore.\r\n\r\n (Laughter)\r\n\r\n We all sit at various places at various times on this scale, but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration, and then the system tips.  And I love asking businesses, \"What's your conversion on new business?\"  And they love to tell you, \"Oh, it's about 10 percent,\"  proudly.  Well, you can trip over 10 percent of the customers.  We all have about 10 percent who just \"get it.\"  That's how we describe them, right?  That's like that gut feeling, \"Oh, they just get it.\"  The problem is: How do you find the ones that get it before you're doing business with them versus the ones who don't get it?  So it's this here, this little gap that you have to close, as Jeffrey Moore calls it, \"Crossing the Chasm\" — because, you see, the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first.  And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters, they're comfortable making those gut decisions.  They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available.\r\n\r\n These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out, when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf.  These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out, even though the technology was substandard.  And, by the way, they didn't do it because the technology was so great;  they did it for themselves.  It's because they wanted to be first.  People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe.  In fact, people will do the things that prove what they believe.  The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours, stood in line for six hours, was because of what they believed about the world, and how they wanted everybody to see them: They were first.  People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it.\r\n\r\n So let me give you a famous example, a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation.  First, the famous failure.  It's a commercial example.  As we said before, a second ago, the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions, right?  You should have success then.  Look at TiVo.  From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day, they are the single highest-quality product on the market, hands down, there is no dispute.  They were extremely well-funded.  Market conditions were fantastic.  I mean, we use TiVo as verb.  I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time.\r\n\r\n But TiVo's a commercial failure.  They've never made money.  And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.  In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.  Because you see, when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had.  They said, \"We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking.\"  And the cynical majority said, \"We don't believe you.  We don't need it.  We don't like it.  You're scaring us.  \"What if they had said, \"If you're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life, boy, do we have a product for you.  It pauses live TV, skips commercials, memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc. \"People don't buy what you do;  they buy why you do it, and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe.\r\n\r\n Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation.  In the summer of 1963, 250,000 people showed upon the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak.  They sent out no invitations, and there was no website to check the date.  How do you do that?  Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America who was a great orator.  He wasn't the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America.  In fact, some of his ideas were bad.  But he had a gift.  He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.  He went around and told people what he believed.  \"I believe, I believe, I believe,\" he told people.  And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.  And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people.  And lo and behold, 250,000 people showed upon the right day at the right time to hear him speak.\r\n\r\n How many of them showed up for him?  Zero.  They showed up for themselves.  It's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August.  It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white: 25 percent of the audience was white.  Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man.  And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world.  It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life.  We followed, not for him, but for ourselves.  And, by the way, he gave the \"I have a dream\" speech, not the \"I have a plan\" speech.\r\n\r\n (Laughter)\r\n\r\n Listen to politicians now, with their comprehensive 12-point plans.  They're not inspiring anybody.  Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.  Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us.  Whether they're individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to.  We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves.  And it's those who start with \"why\" that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much.\r\n\r\n (Applause)"

        "text":"Perspective\r\n Action games, whether directly or indirectly, are intended to be played from the viewpoint of the avatar.  This is obvious when it comes to 3D FPS games such as Quake.  You are looking through the eyes of your character — there's no other way to interpret it.  Unfortunately, despite protests to the contrary, the FPS 3D view is probably one of the most unrealistic views possible.  We do not dispute the aesthetics of this viewpoint — in fact, we believe it is excellent for immersion in a game world, but in strictly purist terms, it is simply not realistic.\r\n\r\n The average human has 120 degrees of vision and can detect movement in the peripheral field at up to 180 degrees laterally.  The average game of Quake shows a 30-degree view — not to mention the fact that your ability to control the character is solely provided via a keyboard/mouse interface.  Compared to the freedom of view and subtle nuance of movement in the real world, in the game world, your avatar is a tunnel-visioned paraplegic in an electric wheelchair.\r\n\r\n Some 3D games, such as Super Mario Sunshine, Max Payne, and the Tomb Raider series, offer a third-person view.  The player can see her avatar onscreen.  Aside from niggling issues with camera control, this is probably the closest perspective to natural vision.  Players can see clearly ahead of them, and they also are provided with limited awareness of what is behind and to the side of them.  The only fly in the ointment as far as this particular scheme goes is the camera.  A good camera can make or break a third-person view game.  If the player is to feel as if she is part of the action rather than a disjointed observer, then the camera must be as unobtrusive as possible.  An obvious camera adds an extra degree of complexity for understanding the world — another obstacle in the way of gameplay.  Giving the player control of the camera is not a solution — it's merely a quick patch of a broken feature.\r\n\r\n For an action game, sometimes it's just not enough to give the player a view that is close to reality.  In order to make the game manageable, it's necessary to give the player super-human vision.  That sounds like a good justification for the 2D viewpoint, but really it is just a rationalization after the fact.  2D action games were often so frenetic simply because of the super-human viewpoint that they offered the player.\r\n\r\n Humans are creatures capable of thinking in three dimensions.  Hence, displaying a representation of a system in 2D instantly confers an advantage.  There is an order of magnitude less complexity for the player to cope with in terms of object positioning.  This means that 2D action games can afford to throw a lot more at the player before overwhelming them than an equivalent 3D game."

If you think a semicolon is a regular colon with an identity crisis, I will not hire you.  If you scatter commas into a sentence with all the discrimination of a shotgun, you might make it to the foyer before we politely escort you from the building.\r\n\r\n Some might call my approach to grammar extreme, but I prefer Lynne Truss's more cuddly phraseology: I am a grammar \"stickler.\"  And, like Truss  —  author of Eats, Shoots & Leaves  —  I have a \"zero tolerance approach\" to grammar mistakes that make people look stupid.\r\n\r\n Now, Truss and I disagree on what it means to have \"zero tolerance.\"  She thinks that people who mix up their itses \"deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave,\" while I just think they deserve to be passed over for a job  —  even if they are otherwise qualified for the position.\r\n\r\n Everyone who applies for a position at either of my companies, iFixit or Dozuki, takes a mandatory grammar test.  Extenuating circumstances aside (dyslexia, English language learners, etc.), if job hopefuls can't distinguish between \"to\" and \"too,\" their applications go into the bin.\r\n\r\n Of course, we write for a living.  iFixit.com is the world's largest online repair manual, and Dozuki helps companies write their own technical documentation, like paperless work instructions and step-by-step user manuals.  So, it makes sense that we've made a preemptive strike against groan-worthy grammar errors.\r\n\r\n But grammar is relevant for all companies.  Yes, language is constantly changing, but that doesn't make grammar unimportant.  Good grammar is credibility, especially on the internet.  In blog posts, on Facebook statuses, in e-mails, and on company websites, your words are all you have.  They are a projection of you in your physical absence.  And, for better or worse, people judge you if you can't tell the difference between their, there, and they're.\r\n\r\n Good grammar makes good business sense  —  and not just when it comes to hiring writers.  Writing isn't in the official job description of most people in our office.  Still, we give our grammar test to everybody, including our salespeople, our operations staff, and our programmers.\r\n\r\n On the face of it, my zero tolerance approach to grammar errors might seem a little unfair.  After all, grammar has nothing to do with job performance, or creativity, or intelligence, right?\r\n\r\n Wrong.  If it takes someone more than 20 years to notice how to properly use \"it's,\" then that's not a learning curve I'm comfortable with.  So, even in this hyper-competitive market, I will pass on a great programmer who cannot write.\r\n\r\n Grammar signifies more than just a person's ability to remember high school English.  I've found that people who make fewer mistakes on a grammar test also make fewer mistakes when they are doing something completely unrelated to writing  —  like stocking shelves or labeling parts.\r\n\r\n In the same vein, programmers who pay attention to how they construct written language also tend to pay a lot more attention to how they code.  You see, at its core, code is prose.  Great programmers are more than just code monkeys;  according to Stanford programming legend Donald Knuth they are \"essayists who work with traditional aesthetic and literary forms.\"  The point: programming should be easily understood by real human beings  —  not just computers.\r\n\r\n And just like good writing and good grammar, when it comes to programming, the devil's in the details.  In fact, when it comes to my whole business, details are everything.\r\n\r\n I hire people who care about those details.  Applicants who don't think writing is important are likely to think lots of other (important) things also aren't important.  And I guarantee that even if other companies aren't issuing grammar tests, they pay attention to sloppy mistakes on résumés.  After all, sloppy is as sloppy does.\r\n\r\n That's why I grammar test people who walk in the door looking for a job.  Grammar is my litmus test.  All applicants say they're detail-oriented;  I just make my employees prove it."

        "text":"http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/be-smarter-get-up-and-walk-around.html\r\n\r\n Sitting around all day isn't just making you unhealthy.  It might also be making you dumber.\r\n Your desk, scientists reported recently, is trying to kill you.\r\n\r\n According to the New York Times, scientists discovered that when we sit all day, \"electrical activity in the muscles drops… leading to a cascade of harmful metabolic effects,\" and sadly even getting regular doses of exercise doesn't offset the damage.  But now there's new evidence of the harm of sitting.  Not only is it making you fatter, it might also be making you dumber.\r\n\r\n Sabine Schaefer, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, recently looked at the effect of walking on working memory.  Your mother may have warned you not to walk and chew gum at the same time, but when Schaefer compared the performance of both children and young adults on a standard test of working memory when they were sitting with when they were walking, her results contradicted mom's advice.  The British Psychological Society's Research Digest sums up the research results:\r\n\r\nThe headline finding was that the working memory performance of both age groups improved when walking at their chosen speed compared with when sitting or walking at a fixed speed set by the researchers.  This was especially the case for more difficult versions of the working memory task, and was more pronounced among the children than the adults.  So, this would appear to be clear case of mental performance actually being superior in a dual-task situation.\r\n\r\n Or in other words, rather than assume that walking while thinking splits your mental and physical resources, leaving less to devote to each, the scientists actually found \"an increase in arousal or activation associated with physical activity… which then can be invested into the cognition,\" according to the paper reporting the research.  Walking increases your resources of energy, which you can then invest in thinking.\r\n\r\n Why didn't walking at \"fixed speed\" have the same effect on working memory as walking at the subjects' preferred pace?  The scientists speculate that, \"walking at the fixed speed, which was considerably slower than the preferred speed in both age groups, might simply not have been fast enough to increase arousal sufficiently to achieve an effect,\" or that the need to \"pay some attention to adjusting one's walking speed to the speed of the treadmill\" interfered with the main memory task.\r\n\r\n Of course, not every mental activity can or should be performed while walking, but this new research reinforces anecdotal evidence and other research findings that suggest being too tightly chained to our desks is bad for our minds as well as our physical health.  Science shows we often have creative breakthrough when our minds are disengaged from the problem we're wrestling with, hence the common experience of getting great ideas while relaxing in the shower.\r\n\r\n Getting up for a walk or a jog is another way to achieve this sort of head space—after all, it worked for Einstein and Charles Darwin.  (Beer, apparently, also helps.)  Other studies have demonstrated that even five minutes outside in nature can improve your mood and self-esteem."

Here's a simple way to know if a job candidate is right for your business.\r\n\r\n Interviewing job candidates is tough, especially because some candidates are a lot better at interviewing than they are at working.\r\n\r\n To get the core info you need about the candidates you interview, here's a simple but incredibly effective interview technique I learned from John Younger, the CEO of Accolo, a cloud recruiting solutions provider.  (If you think you've conducted a lot of interviews, think again: Younger has interviewed thousands of people.)\r\n\r\n Here's how it works.  Just start from the beginning of the candidate's work history and work your way through each subsequent job.  Move quickly, and don't ask for detail.  And don't ask follow-up questions, at least not yet.\r\n\r\n Go through each job and ask the same three questions:\r\n\r\n1.  How did you find out about the job?\r\n\r\n 2.  What did you like about the job before you started?\r\n\r\n 3.  Why did you leave?\r\n\r\n \"What's amazing,\" Younger says, \"is that after a few minutes, you will always have learned something about the candidate—whether positive or negative—that you would never have learned otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n Here's why:\r\n\r\nHow did you find out about the job?\r\n\r\n Job boards, general postings, online listings, job fairs—most people find their first few jobs that way, so that's certainly not a red flag.\r\n\r\n But a candidate who continues to find each successive job from general postings probably hasn't figured out what he or she wants to do—and where he or she would like to do it.\r\n\r\n He or she is just looking for a job;  often, any job.\r\n\r\n And that probably means he or she isn't particularly eager to work for you.  He or she just wants a job.  Yours will do—until something else comes along.\r\n\r\n \"Plus, by the time you get to Job Three, Four, or Five in your career, and you haven't been pulled into a job by someone you previously worked for, that's a red flag,\" Younger says.  \"That shows you didn't build relationships, develop trust, and show a level of competence that made someone go out of their way to bring you into their organization.\"\r\n\r\n On the flip side, being pulled in is like a great reference—without the letter.\r\n\r\n What did you like about the job before you started?\r\n\r\n In time, interviewees should describe the reason they took a particular job for more specific reasons than \"great opportunity,\" \"chance to learn about the industry,\" or \"next step in my career.\"\r\n\r\n Great employees don't work hard because of lofty titles or huge salaries.  They work hard because they appreciate their work environment and enjoy what they do.  (Titles and salary are just icing on the fulfillment cake.)\r\n\r\n That means they know the kind of environment they will thrive in, and they know the type of work that motivates and challenges them—and not only can they describe it, they actively seek it.\r\n\r\n Why did you leave?\r\n\r\n Sometimes people leave for a better opportunity.  Sometimes they leave for more money.\r\n\r\n Often, though, they leave because an employer is too demanding.  Or the employee doesn't get along with his or her boss.  Or the employee doesn't get along with co-workers.\r\n\r\n When that is the case, don't be judgmental.  Resist the temptation to ask for detail.  Hang on to follow-ups.  Stick to the rhythm of the three questions.  That makes it natural for candidates to be more open and candid.\r\n\r\n In the process, many candidates will describe issues with management or disagreements with other employees or with taking responsibility—issues they otherwise would not have shared.\r\n\r\n Then follow up on patterns that concern you.\r\n\r\n \"It's a quick way to get to get to the heart of a candidate's sense of teamwork and responsibility,\" Younger says.  \"Some people never take ownership and always see problems as someone else's problem.  And some candidates have consistently had problems with their bosses—which means they'll also have issues with you.\"\r\n\r\n And a bonus question:\r\n\r\nHow many people have you hired, and where did you find them?\r\n\r\n Say you're interviewing candidates for a leadership position.  Want to know how their direct reports feel about them?\r\n\r\n Don't look only for candidates who were brought into an organization by someone else;  look for candidates who brought employees into their organization.\r\n\r\n \"Great employees go out of their way to work with great leaders,\" Younger says.  \"If you're tough but fair, and you treat people well, they will go out of their way to work with you.  The fact that employees changed jobs just so they could work for you speaks volumes to your leadership and people skills.\""

        "text":"In principle, user interface design for action games is extremely straightforward.  It should follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to the letter.  The user interface should be as minimalist as possible.  In order for the player to be able to effectively play the game, he needs to able to accurately and quickly assess the play environment.\r\n\r\n All the information that the player needs to be able to access in order to be effective at the game should be immediately present onscreen.  Most action games require only a limited amount of information, so this isn't difficult to achieve.  For example, the HUD (Heads-Up Display) for Quake III shows the minimum amount of information.  Basically, it shows the player's current health, weapon, and amount of ammo.  Don't try to show too much information to the player at one time.  Not only does the player have to contend with the frantic action in the game, but he also has to pay attention to the indicators in the status panel.  He should be able to do this at a glance, without having to work to interpret the information.  Use simple schemes to get the required information across.  One way you can do this is to use colors wherever possible to indicate changing situations, rather than textual or numerical methods.  Another important situation to consider is when the player's attention needs to be attracted quickly to a changing status panel, especially when the panel is outside the main field of peripheral vision of the player;  then he will be concentrating on the in-game action, not the status panel.  If you need the player to notice something in the status panel, then you'll need to take appropriate measures.  Within the main focus of view of the player, the eyes are sensitive to color and shape.  Outside of this region, the eye is attuned to detect changes in contrast or color, so the easiest way to draw the attention of the player is to use a flashing or flickering indicator.\r\n\r\n In some cases, additional information (too much to appear comfortably in one small status panel) is required.  This should be avoided whenever possible, but when it is not possible to avoid, it must be handled carefully so as not to disrupt the flow of the game to the detriment of the player.  If the player loses out by having to switch to a secondary map or status screen, then the enjoyment of the game is impacted.  For example, in many FPS games, the level map is shown on a separate screen that obscures the main view.  This means that the player has to be in a safe position to look at the map safely.  Other games use a transparent overlay to display the same map information.  Often, this is the ideal presentation method, as it allows the player to clearly see both the surrounding environment and the map.  However, its effectiveness is limited if the map is so complex that it obscures the main view too much.\r\n\r\n Another golden rule for action games is that the player avatar must be extremely easy to pick out.  In the case of FPS games, this is easy — the avatar is the player, looking out through the screen.  This is the exception, however.  In every other type of action game, the avatar is displayed onscreen.  In almost all cases, the avatar looks unique — it has a unique shape or position onscreen.  However, the most effective way of ensuring that an avatar is easily discernable is use of color.  For example, Lara Croft is the only entity onscreen in Tomb Raider wearing a light blue shirt.  This means that if the player can see a splash of that particular light blue on the screen, then he is looking at Lara.  This also means that Lara is immediately identifiable onscreen without any conscious thought process on the part of the player.  In other games — for example, in the case of two-dimensional scrolling games — the avatar is often distinguished by position.  It is always in the same absolute position — or at least on the same horizontal or vertical line — onscreen, and the world moves around it.  This gives players a fixed point of reference about which to orient themselves.\r\n\r\n Not only is it important to be able to pick out the avatar, but it is also extremely important to be able to quickly identify enemies.  There are several mechanisms in use for this.  The majority of action games use color schemes to achieve this.  As mentioned previously, the avatar is often a unique color.  An extension of this scheme is to ensure that enemies follow a common scheme of color or appearance.  Think of the film Tron — you can easily identify the bad guys because they're the ones in red.  The good guys are in blue.  This is a throwback to the old spaghetti westerns where the good guys wore white and the bad guys wore black.  A similar scheme can also be used for collectible items.  In fact, an often-used scheme is to have the avatar predominantly one color and all collectibles another color, with the majority of the background yet another color.  Anything else is an enemy.  Of course, this is mainly used in older games, and is often tied to hardware limitations (as in Pac-Man).  There is no reason to use this particular configuration, however, and it can be shuffled around, as long as it is consistent.  For example, each level of Space Tripper uses unique color schemes for the enemies, collectibles, and avatar designed to have maximum contrast with the level scenery.  In this way, it is easy for the player to analyze the playing environment as easily as possible.  The only problem with this is the issue of color-blindness.  Relying solely on color as a differentiating indicator excludes a significant section of potential game players.  Use form and contrast in tandem with color to maximize the differentiation methods available to players.  Of course, color blindness typically affects only 10% of males (and even fewer females), and usually only affects the ability to differentiate red from green (and dependent colors).  Other colors (with little or no red/green component, such as shades of blue) are safe to use.\r\n\r\n Action games (with one notable exception) require simple controls.  Because of the fast-action nature of these games, the controls should, wherever possible, directly translate to avatar actions — pushing left on the controls makes the avatar go left, pushing right makes the avatar go right, and so on.  For 2D games, this is a fairly simple endeavor, but for first- or third-person 3D games, there is an additional complication caused by the third dimension.  There will always be an extra level of indirection for the player to deal with, and the controls will not be as intuitive as a 2D game.  Quake-style games, even though they have standardized on a fairly logically consistent control system, are by no means simple for a complete beginner.  Learning to use the Quake-style interface is the biggest barrier to mass-market success for first-person 3D games.  For example, consider the success of the Mario series of games on the early Nintendo console systems.  Super Mario World on the SNES was a system-seller.  On the strength of that game alone, Nintendo sold many SNES systems.  However, the first 3D incarnation of the Mario series, Super Mario 64, was not as immediately successful, even though the control system was as close to optimal as could be hoped.  It was helped somewhat by the sheer eye-candy and novelty value, but for the average player, it was nowhere near as \"pick up and play\" as the earlier games, partially due to the added complexity of managing the camera as well as Mario.\r\n\r\n The notable exception to the simple control systems mentioned previously is the specific sub-genre of fighting games.  For these, moves such as walking, kicking, and punching are fairly straightforward to perform.  But for the more complex and rewarding combo moves, those that can cause more damage to the opponent (and usually carry a correspondingly higher risk due to taking longer to perform), the player is expected to perform a long string of commands in the correct sequence in order to be able to pull off the advanced move.\r\n\r\n At the other end of the spectrum are games in which the player's movements are directly emulated in the game.  Without considering VR systems, a mass-market example of this is the arcade game Dance Dance Revolution.  This is controlled by a set of footpads that the player has to dance upon in attempts to match the flashing icons that appear on the screen.  Consequently, the player's avatar is controlled directly by the dancing (or more accurately, stomping) of the player."

we both know\r\n the answer, don't we?\r\n\r\n No.\r\n\r\n That's not possible.\r\n\r\n It scares you.\r\n\r\n Well, it should.\r\n\r\n Now, put these boys\r\n back together and go.\r\n\r\n I won't ask twice.\r\n\r\n You two\r\n need to be more careful.\r\n\r\n Yeah, I'm starting\r\n to get that.\r\n\r\n Your frat brothers\r\n are bigger dicks than I thought.\r\n\r\n I don't mean\r\n the angels.\r\n\r\n Lucifer is\r\n circling his vessel.\r\n\r\n And once he takes it,\r\n\r\nThose hex bags won't be enough\r\n to protect you.\r\n\r\n What the hell was that?\r\n\r\n An enochian sigil.\r\n\r\n It'll hide you\r\n from every angel in creation,\r\n\r\nIncluding Lucifer.\r\n\r\n What, you just\r\n brand us with it?\r\n\r\n No.  I carved it\r\n into your ribs.\r\n\r\n Hey, Cass,\r\nwere you really dead?\r\n\r\n Yes.\r\n\r\n Then how are you back?\r\n\r\n Nick.\r\n\r\n Nick.\r\n\r\n You're dreaming,\r\nNick.\r\n\r\n But it doesn't mean\r\n this isn't real.\r\n\r\n Sarah?\r\n\r\n I'm not your wife,\r\nNick.\r\n\r\n I'm an angel.\r\n\r\n An angel?\r\n\r\n My name is Lucifer.\r\n\r\n Sure.\r\n\r\n Naturally.\r\n\r\n Um...\r\n\r\n Could you do me\r\n a favor there, satan,\r\n\r\nAnd remind me to quit drinking\r\n before I go to bed?\r\n\r\n I'm here because\r\n you're special, Nick.\r\n\r\n There's very, very few people\r\n like you.\r\n\r\n Is that so?\r\n\r\n You're a vessel   —  \r\n A very powerful vessel.\r\n\r\n Meaning what, exactly?\r\n\r\n I need to take control\r\n of your mind and your body.\r\n\r\n To be honest...\r\n\r\n It'll probably be\r\n unpleasant for you.\r\n\r\n But it is necessary.\r\n\r\n Okay, look...\r\n\r\n If it's just the same to you,\r\nI think I'd like to wake up now.\r\n\r\n I told you   —  \r\n This is real.\r\n\r\n Don't be afraid.\r\n\r\n This is your choice.\r\n\r\n You need\r\n to invite me in.\r\n\r\n Even if\r\n this is real   —  \r\n\r\n Which it's not,\r\nbut assuming it was   —  \r\n\r\n Why the hell would I do\r\n something like that?\r\n\r\n You people\r\n misunderstand me.\r\n\r\n You call me \"satan\"\r\n and \"devil,\" but...\r\n\r\n Do you know my crime?\r\n\r\n I loved god too much.\r\n\r\n And for that,\r\nhe betrayed me   —  \r\n\r\n Punished me.\r\n\r\n Just as\r\n he's punished you.\r\n\r\n After all, how could god\r\n stand idly by\r\n\r\n While that man\r\n broke into your home\r\n\r\n And butchered your family\r\n in their beds?\r\n\r\n There are only\r\n two rational answers, Nick   —  \r\n\r\n Either he's sadistic...\r\n\r\n Or he simply\r\n doesn't care.\r\n\r\n You're angry.\r\n\r\n You have every right\r\n to be angry.\r\n\r\n I am angry, too.\r\n\r\n That's why\r\n I want to find him   —  \r\n\r\n Hold him accountable\r\n for his actions.\r\n\r\n Just because\r\n he created us\r\n\r\n Doesn't mean he can toy with us,\r\nlike playthings.\r\n\r\n If I help you...\r\n\r\n Can you bring back\r\n my family?\r\n\r\n I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n I can't.\r\n\r\n But I can give you\r\n the next best thing.\r\n\r\n God did this to you,\r\nNick.\r\n\r\n And I can\r\n give you justice.\r\n\r\n Peace.\r\n\r\n How do I know\r\n you're telling the truth?\r\n\r\n Because,\r\ncontrary to popular belief,\r\n\r\nI don't lie.\r\n\r\n I don't need to.\r\n\r\n What I need...\r\n\r\n Is you.\r\n\r\n Nick, I need you\r\n to say yes.\r\n\r\n Then yes.\r\n\r\n Bobby:\r\n\"unlikely to walk again\"?!\r\n\r\n Why, you snot-Nosed\r\n son of a bitch!\r\n\r\n Wait till\r\n I get out of this bed!\r\n\r\n I'll use my game leg\r\n and kick your friggin' ass!\r\n\r\n Yeah, you better run!\r\n\r\n You believe that yahoo?\r\n\r\n Screw him.\r\n You'll be fine.\r\n\r\n Sam: so, let me ask\r\n the million-Dollar question.\r\n\r\n What do we do now?\r\n\r\n Well...\r\n\r\n We save as many as we can\r\n\r\n for as long as we can, I guess.\r\n\r\n It's bad.\r\n\r\n Whoever wins, heaven or hell,\r\nwe're boned.\r\n\r\n What if we win?\r\n\r\n I'm serious.\r\n\r\n I mean, screw the angels\r\n and the demons\r\n\r\n And their\r\n crap apocalypse.\r\n\r\n They want to fight a war,\r\nthey can find their own planet.\r\n\r\n This one's ours, and I say\r\n they get the hell off it.\r\n\r\n We take 'em all on.\r\n We kill the devil.\r\n\r\n Hell, we even kill Michael\r\n if we have to.\r\n\r\n But we do it\r\n our own damn selves.\r\n\r\n And how are we supposed to\r\n do all this, genius?\r\n\r\n I got no idea.\r\n\r\n But what I do have\r\n is a g.E.D.\r\n\r\n And a \"give 'em hell\" attitude,\r\nand I'll figure it out.\r\n\r\n You are\r\n nine kinds of crazy, boy.\r\n\r\n It's been said.\r\n\r\n Listen,\r\nyou stay on the mend.\r\n\r\n We'll see you in a bit.\r\n\r\n Sam?\r\n\r\n I was awake.\r\n\r\n I know what I said\r\n back there.\r\n\r\n I just want you\r\n to know that...\r\n\r\n That was the demon\r\n talking.\r\n\r\n I ain't cutting you out,\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n Not ever.\r\n\r\n Thanks, Bobby.\r\n\r\n You're welcome.\r\n\r\n I deserve a damn medal\r\n for this,\r\n\r\nBut...you're welcome.\r\n\r\n You know,\r\nI was thinking, Dean   —  \r\n\r\n Maybe we could\r\n go after the colt.\r\n\r\n Why?  What difference\r\n would that make?\r\n\r\n Well, we could use it\r\n on Lucifer.\r\n\r\n I mean, you just said\r\n back there   —  \r\n\r\n I just said a bunch of crap\r\n for Bobby's benefit.\r\n\r\n I mean...\r\n I'll fight.\r\n\r\n I'll fight till the last man,\r\nbut let's at least be honest.\r\n\r\n I mean, we don't stand\r\n a snowball's chance,\r\n\r\nAnd you know that.\r\n\r\n I mean, hell,\r\nyou of all people know that.\r\n\r\n Dean...\r\n\r\n Is there something\r\n you want to say to me?\r\n\r\n I tried, Sammy.\r\n\r\n I mean,\r\nI really tried.\r\n\r\n But I just can't keep pretending\r\n that everything's all right.\r\n\r\n Because it's not.\r\n\r\n And it's never\r\n going to be.\r\n\r\n You chose a demon\r\n over your own brother,\r\n\r\nAnd look\r\n what happened.\r\n\r\n I would give anything   —  \r\n Anything   —  \r\n\r\n To take it all back.\r\n\r\n I know you would.\r\n\r\n And I know\r\n how sorry you are.  I do.\r\n\r\n But, man...\r\n\r\n You were the one\r\n that I depended on the most.\r\n\r\n And you let me down\r\n in ways that I can't even...\r\n\r\n I'm just   —  \r\n\r\n I'm having a hard time\r\n forgiving and forgetting here.\r\n\r\n You know?\r\n\r\n What can I do?\r\n\r\n Honestly?\r\n\r\n Nothing.\r\n\r\n I just don't...\r\n\r\n I don't think that we can\r\n ever be what we were.\r\n\r\n You know?\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"“Right.  You win some, you lose some.”  I added, “Even Jesus said to give unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s.”\r\n “Yeah, but Jesus was a nice guy, and he didn’t have a tax lawyer.  Or a criminal attorney.”  Anthony smiled and continued, “That’s why he got nailed.”\r\n I reminded him, “I was on my way to beating the murder charge.”\r\n “Yeah, okay, but if my father didn’t do anything criminal, then how did they get his property?”\r\n “I told you.  Tax evasion.”\r\n “That’s bullshit.”\r\n “No, it’s criminal.”  The truth was, as I said, and as Anthony surely knew, the Justice Department and the IRS had enough real and manufactured evidence on Frank Bellarosa to make his life a living hell.  Plus, Frank’s own brother-in-law, Sally Da-da – Anna’s sister’s husband – had tried to whack Frank, and Frank’s aura of power and strength was waning.  So he took the easy way out and accepted the government’s deal.  To wit: Tell us about every crime you ever committed, Frank, and give us the names of your hoodlum friends.  Then you abdicate your title, give us all your money, and you can go into exile a free man.  Not a bad deal, and better than prison.  Plus, the exile to Italy fit in nicely with Frank and Susan’s plans to run off together, but I didn’t think Anthony wanted to know all of that.  In fact, he wanted the bullshit.\r\n “And there was nothing you could do to hold on to Alhambra?”\r\n “No.”\r\n “Okay… hey, I heard that my father also owned your place.  He bought that, too.”\r\n “He bought Stanhope Hall from my father-in-law.”  I was tempted to say, “I think he needed more room to bury bodies,” but I said, “He wanted to control the land development around his estate.”  In fact, as I said, Susan had most probably talked her lover into that purchase.  My father-in-law, William the Skinflint, wanted to dump this expensive white elephant, and for the right price he would have sold it to the devil.  Actually, he did.\r\n Susan had been upset at the thought of the family home passing into the hands of some stranger or a developer, and I believe she saw don Bellarosa as her white knight who could save the estate for her.  I have no idea what the deal was between her and her lover, but I suspected that she at least had thoughts of living there with Frank.  But then Frank sold out to the Feds and went into the Witness Protection Program, and Italy, I think, became Plan B.\r\n I really should have insisted that I had to go, but Anthony seemed obsessed with the Federal government seizing a sizable fortune in property and cash from his father, going so far as to ask me, “Hey, do you think I have a shot at getting that back?”\r\n “You have about as much chance of recovering assets seized under the RICO Act as I have of getting the Man of the Year Award from the Sons of Italy.”\r\n He persisted.  “How about those millions in bond money that you posted for my father?  Right?  He died before the trial, and he didn’t commit the murder.  So why can’t you get that back?”\r\n I saw where this was going, of course, and I definitely didn’t want to go there.  I said, “As I understand it, those assets, including Stanhope Hall, were returned to your father’s estate, then seized as part of his tax settlement with the IRS.”\r\n “Yeah, but-”\r\n “There are no buts, Anthony.  I did what I could at the time.  Your father was satisfied with my representation, and there are no do-overs.”\r\n Bottom line, his obsession with the lost fortune was mostly smoke. "

        "text":"The Whole Earth Catalog was an American counterculture catalog published by Stewart Brand between 1968 and 1972, and occasionally thereafter, until 1998.  Although the WECs listed all sorts of products for sale (clothing, books, tools, machines, seeds – things useful for a creative or self-sustainable lifestyle) the Whole Earth Catalogs themselves did not sell any of the products.  Instead the vendors and their prices were listed right alongside with the items.  This led to a need for the Catalogs to be frequently updated.\r\n\r\n Origin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Fall 1969 cover\r\n The title Whole Earth Catalog came from a previous project of Stewart Brand.  In 1966, he initiated a public campaign to have NASA release the then-rumored satellite photo of the sphere of Earth as seen from space, the first image of the \"Whole Earth.\"  He thought the image might be a powerful symbol, evoking a sense of shared destiny and adaptive strategies from people.  The Stanford-educated Brand, a biologist with strong artistic and social interests, believed that there was a groundswell of commitment to thoroughly renovating American industrial society along ecologically and socially just lines, whatever they might prove to be.\r\n Andrew Kirk in Counterculture Green notes that the Whole Earth Catalog was preceded by the \"Whole Earth Truck Store\".  The WETS was a 1963 Dodge truck  —  in 1968 Brand and his wife Lois embarked \"on a commune road trip\" with the truck hoping to tour the country doing educational fairs.  The truck was not only a store, but also an alternative lending library and a mobile microeducation service. [1] The \"Truck Store\" finally settled into its permanent location in Menlo Park, California. [2] Instead of bringing the store to the people, Brand decided to create a catalog so the people could contact the vendors directly.\r\n Using the most basic of typesetting and page-layout tools, Brand and his colleagues created the first issue of The Whole Earth Catalog in 1968.  In subsequent issues, its production values gradually improved.  Its outsize pages measured 11x14 inches (28x36 cm).  Later editions were more than an inch thick.  The early editions were published by the Portola Institute, headed by Richard Raymond.  The so-called Last Whole Earth Catalogue (June 1971) won the first U.S. National Book Award in category Contemporary Affairs. [3] It was the first time a catalog had ever won such an award. [citation needed] Brand's intent with the catalog was to provide education and \"access to tools\" so a reader could \"find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.\" [4]\r\n J. Baldwin was a young designer and instructor of design at colleges around the San Francisco Bay (San Francisco State University [then San Francisco State College], the San Francisco Art Institute, and the California College of the Arts [then California College of Arts and Crafts]).  As he recalled in the film Ecological Design (1994), \"Stewart Brand came to me because he heard that I read catalogs.  He said, 'I want to make this thing called a \"whole Earth\" catalog so that anyone on Earth can pick up a telephone and find out the complete information on anything.  ...That’s my goal.'\"  Baldwin served as the chief editor of subjects in the areas of technology and design, both in the catalog itself and in other publications which arose from it.\r\n True to his 1966 vision, Brand's publishing efforts were suffused with an awareness of the importance of ecology, both as a field of study and as an influence upon the future of humankind and emerging human awareness.\r\n [edit]Organization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n One page of a 1969 Whole Earth Catalog\r\n From the opening page of the 1969 Catalog:\r\nFunction\r\n The WHOLE EARTH CATALOG functions as an evaluation and access device.  With it, the user should know better what is worth getting and where and how to do the getting.  An item is listed in the CATALOG if it is deemed:\r\nUseful as a tool,\r\nRelevant to independent education,\r\nHigh quality or low cost,\r\nNot already common knowledge,\r\nEasily available by mail.\r\n CATALOG listings are continually revised according to the experience and suggestions of CATALOG users and staff.\r\n Purpose\r\n We are as gods and might as well get good at it.  So far, remotely done power and glory — as via government, big business, formal education, church — has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains.  In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing — power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested.  Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.\r\n The 1968 catalog divided itself into seven broad sections:\r\nUnderstanding Whole Systems\r\n Shelter and Land Use\r\n Industry and Craft\r\n Communications\r\n Community\r\n Nomadics\r\n Learning\r\n Within each section, the best tools and books the editors could find were collected and listed, along with images, reviews and uses, prices, and suppliers.  The reader was also able to order some items directly through the catalog.\r\n Later editions changed a few of the headings, but generally kept the same overall framework.\r\n The Catalog used a broad definition of \"tools.\"  There were informative tools, such as books, maps, professional journals, courses, and classes.  There were well-designed special-purpose utensils, including garden tools, carpenters' and masons' tools, welding equipment, chainsaws, fiberglass materials, tents, hiking shoes, and potters' wheels.  There were even early synthesizers and personal computers.\r\n The Catalog's publication coincided with a great wave of convention-challenging experimentalism and a do-it-yourself attitude associated with \"the counterculture,\" and tended to appeal not only to the intelligentsia of the movement, but to creative, hands-on, and outdoorsy people of many stripes.  Some of the ideas in the Catalog were developed during Brand's visits to Drop City.\r\n With the Catalog opened flat, the reader might find the large page on the left full of text and intriguing illustrations from a volume of Joseph Needham’s Science and Civilization in China, showing and explaining an astronomical clock tower or a chain-pump windmill, while on the right-hand page are an excellent review of a beginners' guide to modern technology (The Way Things Work) and a review of The Engineers’ Illustrated Thesaurus.  On another spread, the verso reviews books on accounting and moonlighting jobs, while the recto bears an article in which people tell the story of a community credit union they founded.  Another pair of pages depict and discuss different kayaks, inflatable dinghies, and houseboats.\r\n [edit]Impact\r\n\r\n Steve Jobs compared The Whole Earth Catalog to Internet search engine Google in his June 2005 Stanford University commencement speech.

A flooding sea of hot air;  it seemed as if someone had left a bakery door open.  The heat pulsed among the cottages and bushes and children.  The icicles dropped, shattering, to melt.  The doors flew open.  The windows flew up.  The children worked off their wool clothes.  The housewives shed their bear disguises.  The snow dissolved and showed last summer’s ancient green lawns.\r\n Rocket summer.  The words passed among the people in the open, airing houses.  Rocket summer.  The warm desert air changing the frost patterns on the windows, erasing the art work.  The skis and sleds suddenly useless.  The snow, falling from the cold sky upon the town, turned to a hot rain before it touched the ground.\r\n Rocket summer.  People leaned from their dripping porches and watched the reddening sky.\r\n The rocket lay on the launching field, blowing out pink clouds of fire and oven heat.  The rocket stood in the cold winter morning, making summer with every breath of its mighty exhausts.  The rocket made climates, and summer lay for a brief moment upon the land . . ."

        "text":"\"When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation....  It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along.  It was idealistic and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\"  During the commencement speech, Jobs also quoted the farewell message placed on the back cover of the 1974 edition of the catalog: \"Stay hungry.  Stay foolish.\" [5][6][7]\r\n Kevin Kelly made a similar comparison in 2008:\r\nFor this new countercultural movement, information was a precious commodity.  In the ’60s, there was no Internet;  no 500 cable channels.  [...  The WEC] was a great example of user-generated content, without advertising, before the Internet.  Basically, Brand invented the blogosphere long before there was any such thing as a blog.  [...] No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included.  [...] This I am sure about: it is no coincidence that the Whole Earth Catalogs disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived.  Everything the Whole Earth Catalogs did, the web does better. [8]\r\n Looking back and discussing attitudes evident in the early editions of the catalog, Brand wrote, “At a time when the New Left was calling for grassroots political (i.e., referred) power, Whole Earth eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots direct power — tools and skills.” [9]\r\n The broad interpretation of \"tool\" coincided with that given by the designer, philosopher, and engineer Buckminster Fuller, though another thinker admired by Brand and some of his cohorts was Lewis Mumford, who had written about words as tools.  Early editions reflected the considerable influence of Fuller, particularly his teachings about \"whole systems,\" \"synergetics,\" and efficiency or reducing waste.  By 1971, Brand and his co-workers were already questioning whether Fuller’s sense of direction might be too anthropocentric.  New information arising in fields like ecology and biospherics was persuasive.\r\n By the mid-1970s, much of the Buddhist economics viewpoint of E. F. Schumacher, as well as the activist interests of the biological species preservationists, had tempered the overall enthusiasm for Fuller's ideas in the catalog. [citation needed] Still later, the amiable-architecture ideas of people like Christopher Alexander and similar community-planning ideas of people like Peter Calthorpe further tempered the engineering-efficiency tone of Fuller's ideas. [citation needed]\r\n An important shift in philosophy in the Catalogs occurred in the early 1970s, when Brand decided that the early stance of emphasizing individualism should be replaced with one favoring community.  He had originally written that \"a realm of intimate, personal power is developing\";  regarding this as important in some respects (to wit, the soon-emerging potentials of personal computing), Brand felt that the over-arching project of humankind had more to do with living within natural systems, and this is something we do in common, interactively. [citation needed]\r\n As an early indicator of the general zeitgeist of the times, the catalog's first edition preceded the original Earth Day by nearly two years.  The idea of Earth Day occurred to Senator Gaylord Nelson, its instigator, \"in the summer of 1969 while on a conservation speaking tour out west,\" where the Sierra Club was active, and where young minds had been broadened and stimulated by such influences as the catalog.\r\n"

She had never expected this to happen between them.  Nothing really had happened, but there was a glimmer of it, a possibility, and she wanted to take a chance with him.  “What if it doesn’t work?  Then you’ll hate me, you’ll get mad and move out, and I’ll never see you or Ian again.  That would be terrible, Chris.”\r\n “Yes, it would,” he agreed.  “Let’s try not to let that happen.  We’ll work it out.”  She nodded and he kissed her again, and then he pulled himself away from her and stood up.  She walked him to the door of her living room, and he smiled as he walked up the stairs to his own room.  Ian was sleeping with the TV on, and Chris had a wild urge to let out a war whoop of glee.  He had kissed her!  She was a wonderful woman.  He trusted her completely.  And what better combination than two relationship-phobics who were scared to death?  Better yet that they had started as friends."

It had cost Francesca two thousand dollars, which was a stretch for her, but she had no choice.\r\n Marya and Charles-Edouard baby-sat for Ian on Tuesday when Chris took Francesca out to dinner.  She had to take Marya into her confidence, otherwise it didn’t make sense.\r\n “Like a date?”  Marya looked shocked.  She hadn’t picked up even a hint of romance between them, ever, although she loved them both, and could easily see them together.  But she had never thought it appealed to either of them and had been sorry it didn’t.\r\n “Yeah.  Like a date,” Francesca admitted, looking embarrassed.  She felt awkward saying it to anyone.  She didn’t even feel like dating material anymore.  She had been in neutral for nearly a year.  “At least that’s what he said.  But don’t tell anyone.”\r\n “Who am I going to tell?  Page Six of the New York Post?”  Marya was laughing at her.  Francesca was a wreck.\r\n “I don’t know  —  Ian, my mother, Charles-Edouard.  I don’t want to make this a bigger deal than it is.  It’s just dinner.”  But it was dinner with Chris, in a restaurant, and he had called it a date.  And he had kissed her several times.\r\n “Is it a big deal?”  Marya asked her pointedly.\r\n “Maybe ... I don’t know ... maybe not ... maybe it will be.  Maybe it shouldn’t be.  Maybe we’re both too afraid.”\r\n “What if you’re not?  What if it works?”  “That’s even scarier,” Francesca said, looking panicked.  “That’s how I felt about Charles-Edouard.  It’s a little frightening getting into a\r\n relationship, at any age.  And the older you are, the more defined your personality and your life, and the harder it is to put the puzzle pieces together.”\r\n “How’s it going with you and him?”  Francesca asked her.  Marya looked ecstatic, and so did he.\r\n “It’s fantastic.  Other than my late husband, he’s the most wonderful man I’ve ever met.  I’m a very lucky woman to have two great men in one lifetime.  It’s probably more than I deserve, but I’m loving it,” she said humbly.\r\n “You deserve it,” Francesca confirmed to her.  “Just don’t say that to my mother.  But what the hell, she’s had five helpings at the buffet of life, you only had one.  You have a right to seconds.”  She was happy for her.\r\n “My best advice to you is to just see what comes with Chris.  Don’t anticipate, don’t project, don’t expect him to be someone he isn’t, or try to be someone you’re not.  Be\r\n yourself.  And enjoy it.”  It was good advice.  “And don’t worry about Ian.  I’m happy to baby-sit for him anytime.  And Charles-Edouard loves him too.  When Chris takes you out, sign us up for Ian.  We’ll make cookies or something.  Have fun,” Marya said to her, as she went upstairs to dress.\r\n For the first time in months, when Francesca sat in the bathtub, she shaved her legs.  She didn’t know yet if she’d wear a dress, but whether she did or not, it was a symbolic gesture.  “Welcome back to the world,” she said to herself in the tub, and then she laughed out loud.\r\n “What did you tell them?”  Chris asked her as they hurried down the steps and the front door closed behind them.  She was wearing a black leather skirt, a red sweater, and high heels.  She felt a little like her mother, and worried that she’d overdone it.  She didn’t want to look like she was trying too hard. "

        "text":" Very clearly, sharply, the sound of the evil insect weapon.\r\n Her body jerked with it.\r\n It came from a long way off, One shot.  The swift humming distant bees.  One shot.  And then a second shot, precise and cold, and far away.\r\n Her body winced again and for some reason she started up, screaming, and screaming, and never wanting to stop screaming.  She ran violently through the house and once more threw wide the door.\r\n The echoes were dying away, away.\r\n Gone.\r\n She waited in the yard, her face pale, for five minutes.\r\n Finally, with slow steps, her head down, she wandered about the pillared rooms, laying her hand to things, her lips quivering, until finally she sat alone in the darkening wine room, waiting.  She began to wipe an amber glass with the hem of her scarf.\r\n And then, from far off, the sound of footsteps crunching on the thin, small rocks.\r\n She rose up to stand in the center of the quiet room.  The glass fell from her fingers, smashing to bits.\r\n The footsteps hesitated outside the door.\r\n Should she speak?  Should she cry out, “Come in, oh, come in”?\r\n She went forward a few paces.\r\n The footsteps walked up the ramp.  A hand twisted the door latch.\r\n She smiled at the door.\r\n The door opened.  She stopped smiling.\r\n It was her husband.  His silver mask glowed dully.\r\n He entered the room and looked at her for only a moment.  Then he snapped the weapon bellows open, cracked out two dead bees, heard them spat on the floor as they fell, stepped on them, and placed the empty bellows gun in the corner of the room as Ylla bent down and tried, over and over, with no success, to pick up the pieces of the shattered glass.  “What were you doing?”  she asked.\r\n “Nothing,” he said with his back turned.  He removed the mask.\r\n “But the gun — I heard you fire it.  Twice.”\r\n “Just hunting.  Once in a while you like to hunt.  Did Dr. Nile arrive?”\r\n “No.”\r\n “Wait a minute.”  He snapped his fingers disgustedly.  “Why, I remember now.  He was supposed to visit us tomorrow afternoon.  How stupid of me.”\r\n They sat down to eat.  She looked at her food and did not move her hands.  “What’s wrong?”  he asked, not looking up from dipping his meat in the bubbling lava.\r\n “I don’t know.  I’m not hungry,” she said.\r\n “Why not?”\r\n “I don’t know;  I’m just not.”\r\n The wind was rising across the sky;  the sun was going down.  The room was small and suddenly cold.\r\n “I’ve been trying to remember,” she said in the silent room, across from her cold, erect, golden-eyed husband.\r\n “Remember what?”  He sipped his wine.\r\n “That song.  That fine and beautiful song.”  She closed her eyes and hummed, but it was not the song.  “I’ve forgotten it.  And, somehow, I don’t want to forget it.  It’s something I want always to remember.”  She moved her hands as if the rhythm might help her to remember all of it.  Then she lay back in her chair.  “I can’t remember.”  She began to cry.\r\n “Why are you crying?”  he asked.\r\n “I don’t know, I don’t know, but I can’t help it.  I’m sad and I don’t know why, I cry and I don’t know why, but I’m crying.”\r\n Her head was in her hands;  her shoulders moved again and again.\r\n “You’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said.\r\n She did not look up at him;  she looked only at the empty desert and the very bright stars coming out now on the black sky, and far away there was a sound of wind rising and canal waters stirring cold in the long canals.  She shut her eyes, trembling.\r\n “Yes,” she said.  “I’ll be all right tomorrow.”"

ago.\r\n\r\n Frank was really broken up about it.\r\n\r\n Don't be scared of donny.\r\n\r\n He's a sweetheart.\r\n\r\n It's marie you got to look out for.\r\n\r\n She smells fear.\r\n\r\n Any luck at

kind of weird.\r\n\r\n Do you hear something?\r\n\r\n Am I haunted?\r\n\r\n Am I haunted?!\r\n\r\n Dude.\r\n\r\n Look at this.\r\n\r\n I just talked to bobby.  and?\r\n\r\n Um,well,you're not gonna like it.\r\n\r\n What?\r\n\r\n It's ghost sickness.\r\n\r\n Ghost sickness?  yeah.\r\n\r\n God,no.  yeah.\r\n\r\n I don't even know what that is.  okay.\r\n\r\n Some cultures believe\r\n that certain spirits\r\n\r\n Can infect the living\r\n with a disease,which is\r\n\r\n Why they stopped\r\n displaying bodies in houses\r\n\r\n And started taking them\r\n off to funeral homes.\r\n\r\n Okay,get to the good stuff.\r\n\r\n Symptoms are you get anxious...\r\n\r\n Yeah.  ...and scared,then really\r\n scared,then your heart gives out.\r\n\r\n Sound familiar?\r\n\r\n Yeah,but,Sam,we haven't\r\n seen a ghost in weeks.\r\n\r\n Well,I doubt you\r\n caught it from a ghost.\r\n\r\n Look,once a spirit\r\n infects that first person,\r\n\r\nGhost sickness can spread like any\r\n sickness through a cough,a handshake,\r\n\r\nWhatever.\r\n\r\n It's like the flu.\r\n\r\n Now,frank o'brien\r\n was the first to die,\r\n\r\nWhich means he was\r\n probably the first infected.\r\n\r\n Patient zero.\r\n\r\n Our very own outbreak monkey.\r\n\r\n Right.  get this   —   frank was\r\n in maumee over the weekend.\r\n\r\n Softball tournament...\r\n\r\n Which is where he must have\r\n infected the other two victims.\r\n\r\n Were they gamecocks?\r\n\r\n Cornjerkers.\r\n\r\n So,ghosts infected frank,he\r\n passed it on to the other guys,\r\n\r\nAnd I got it from his corpse?  right.\r\n\r\n So now,what,I have 48 hours before\r\n I go insane and my heart stops?\r\n\r\n More like 24.\r\n\r\n - Super.\r\n - yeah.\r\n\r\n Well,why me?  why not you?\r\n\r\n I mean,you got hit\r\n with the spleen juice.\r\n\r\n Yeah,um,you see,bobby and I\r\n have a theory about that,too.\r\n\r\n ­­ Turns out all three victims\r\n shared a certain,uh,personality type.\r\n\r\n Frank was a bully.\r\n\r\n The other two victims   —  \r\n one was a vice principal,\r\n\r\nThe other was a bouncer.\r\n\r\n Okay.\r\n\r\n Basically,they were all dicks.\r\n\r\n So you're saying I'm a dick?\r\n\r\n No,no,no.\r\n\r\n It's not just that.\r\n\r\n All three victims\r\n used fear as a weapon,\r\n\r\nAnd now this disease is\r\n just returning the favor.\r\n\r\n I don't scare people.\r\n\r\n Dean,all we do is scare people.\r\n\r\n Okay,well,then,you're a dick,too.\r\n\r\n Apparently,I'm not.  whatever.\r\n\r\n How do we stop it?\r\n\r\n We gank the ghost\r\n that started all this.\r\n\r\n We do that,the disease\r\n should clear up.\r\n\r\n You thinking frank's wife?\r\n\r\n Who knows why she\r\n killed herself,you know?\r\n\r\n What are you doing\r\n waiting out here,anyway?\r\n\r\n Our room's on the fourth floor.\r\n\r\n It's   —  \r\n it's high.\r\n\r\n I'll see if I can move\r\n us down to the first.\r\n\r\n Thanks.  sure.\r\n\r\n Everything all right?\r\n\r\n Oh,yeah.\r\n\r\n Just peachy.\r\n\r\n -\r\n - Find anything?  yeah.\r\n\r\n ­ Jessie o'brien's body was cremated,\r\n\r\nSo I'm pretty sure\r\n she is not our ghost.\r\n\r\n Hey.\r\n\r\n Quit picking at that.\r\n\r\n -\r\n - How you feeling?  awesome.\r\n\r\n It's nice to have my head\r\n on the chopping block again.\r\n\r\n I almost forgot what\r\n that feels like.  yeah.\r\n\r\n It's freaking delightful.\r\n\r\n We'll keep looking.\r\n\r\n You okay?\r\n\r\n Dean.\r\n\r\n We've been completely ignoring\r\n the biggest clue we have   —   you.\r\n\r\n I don't want to be a clue.\r\n\r\n The abrasions,this   —   the disease,it's\r\n trying to tell us something.\r\n\r\n Tell us what\r\n —   wood chips?\r\n\r\n Exactly.\r\n\r\n I'm not going in there.\r\n\r\n I need backup,and\r\n you're all I've got.\r\n\r\n You're going in,Dean.\r\n\r\n Let's do this.\r\n\r\n It is a little spooky,isn't it?\r\n\r\n Oh,I'm not carrying that.\r\n\r\n It could go off.\r\n\r\n I'll man the flashlight.\r\n\r\n You do that.\r\n\r\n Emf's not gonna work\r\n with me around,is it?\r\n\r\n You don't say.\r\n\r\n Come on.\r\n\r\n What\r\n —   shh.\r\n\r\n \"to frank.  love,jessie.\"\r\n\r\n Frank o'brien's ring.\r\n\r\n What the hell was frank doing here?\r\n\r\n No idea.\r\n\r\n That was scary!\r\n\r\n Wait.\r\n\r\n Luther garland.\r\n\r\n Hey,this is,uh...\r\n\r\n ...this is frank's wife.\r\n\r\n Plot thickens.\r\n\r\n Yeah...\r\n\r\n But into what?\r\n\r\n Guess we got the right place.\r\n\r\n Is he...drunk?\r\n\r\n No.\r\n\r\n Deputy,according to this,\r\n\r\nLuther garland's cause of\r\n death was physical trauma.\r\n\r\n What does that mean?\r\n\r\n The guy died 20 years\r\n ago   —   before my time.\r\n\r\n Sorry.\r\n\r\n Then can we talk to the sheriff?\r\n\r\n Um,he's out sick today.\r\n\r\n Well,if you see him,will\r\n you have him call us?\r\n\r\n We're staying at the bluebird.\r\n\r\n Mind if I take this?\r\n\r\n Know what?\r\n\r\n You're awesome.\r\n\r\n Thanks.\r\n\r\n Um,y-you too,I guess.\r\n\r\n ­ Who was that?\r\n\r\n It,uh   —  \r\n those fbi guys.\r\n\r\n What did they want?\r\n\r\n A file   —  \r\n luther garland's.\r\n\r\n Sheriff?\r\n\r\n They know.\r\n\r\n They know.\r\n\r\n They know what you did,and\r\n they're gonna make you pay.\r\n\r\n This isn't gonna work.\r\n\r\n Come on,these badges are fake.\r\n\r\n What if we get busted?\r\n we could go to jail.\r\n\r\n Dean,shh!  calm down.\r\n\r\n Deep breath,okay?\r\n\r\n There.  you feel better?\r\n\r\n Just come on.\r\n\r\n Don't scratch.\r\n\r\n Mr. garland.\r\n\r\n Hi.  um,I'm agent tyler.\r\n\r\n This is agent\r\n perry   —   fbi.\r\n\r\n We'd like to ask you a few\r\n questions about your brother luther.\r\n\r\n Let me see some I.d.\r\n\r\n Certainly.\r\n\r\n Those are real.\r\n\r\n Obviously.\r\n\r\n ­ I mean,who would pretend\r\n to be an fbi agent,huh?\r\n\r\n That's just nutty.\r\n\r\n What do you want to know?\r\n\r\n Uh,well...\r\n\r\n According to this,your brother\r\n luther died of physical trauma.\r\n\r\n You don't agree.\r\n\r\n No,I don't.\r\n\r\n Well,then,what would you call it?\r\n\r\n Don't matter what an old man thinks.\r\n\r\n Mr. Garland...\r\n\r\n We're just trying to get\r\n the truth on your brother.\r\n\r\n Please.\r\n\r\n Everybody was scared of luther.\r\n\r\n They called him a monster.\r\n\r\n He was too big,too mean-looking.\r\n\r\n Just too different.\r\n\r\n Didn't matter he was the\r\n kindest man I ever knew.\r\n\r\n Didn't matter he'd never hurt no one.\r\n\r\n A lot of people failed luther.\r\n\r\n I was one of them.\r\n\r\n I was a widower with three young'uns,\r\n\r\nAnd I told myself there\r\n was nothing I could do.\r\n\r\n Mr. garland,um...\r\n\r\n Do you recognize this woman?\r\n\r\n It's jessie o'brien.\r\n\r\n Her man,frank,killed luther.\r\n\r\n How do you know that?\r\n\r\n Everybody knows.\r\n\r\n They just don't talk about it.\r\n\r\n Jessie was a\r\n receptionist at the mill.\r\n\r\n She was always real nice to\r\n luther,and he had a crush on her.\r\n\r\n But frank didn't like it.\r\n\r\n And when jessie went missing,\r\n\r\nFrank was sure that luther\r\n had done something to her.\r\n\r\n Turns out the old gal killed\r\n herself,but frank didn't know that.\r\n\r\n They found luther with a\r\n chain wrapped around his neck.\r\n\r\n He was dragged up\r\n and down the stretch\r\n\r\n Outside that plant\r\n till he was past dead.\r\n\r\n And o'brien was never arrested?\r\n\r\n I screamed to every cop in town.\r\n\r\n They didn't want to look into frank.\r\n\r\n He was a pillar of the community.\r\n\r\n My brother was just the town freak.\r\n\r\n You must have hated frank o'brien.\r\n\r\n I did for a long time,but\r\n life's too short for hate,son.\r\n\r\n And frank wasn't thinking straight.\r\n\r\n His wife had vanished.\r\n he was terrified.\r\n\r\n A damn shame he had to put luther\r\n through the same,but...that's fear.\r\n\r\n It spreads and spreads.\r\n\r\n Now we know what\r\n these are   —   road rash,\r\n\r\nAnd I'm guessing luther\r\n swallowed some wood\r\n\r\n Chips when he was being\r\n dragged down that road.\r\n\r\n Makes sense.\r\n\r\n ­ You're experiencing\r\n his death in slow motion.\r\n\r\n Yeah,well,not slow enough,huh?\r\n\r\n Say we burn some bones\r\n and get me healthy.\r\n\r\n Dean,it won't be that easy.\r\n\r\n No,no.  it'll be that easy.\r\n\r\n Why wouldn't it be that easy?\r\n\r\n Luther was road-hauled.\r\n\r\n His body was ripped to pieces.\r\n\r\n He was probably scattered\r\n all over that road.\r\n\r\n There's no way we're\r\n gonna find all the remains.\r\n\r\n You're kidding me.\r\n\r\n Look,we'll just have to\r\n figure something else out.\r\n\r\n You know what?  screw this.\r\n\r\n Whoa,whoa,whoa.  Dean.\r\n\r\n Come on.  no,I mean,come on,Sam.\r\n\r\n What are we doing?!\r\n\r\n We're hunting a ghost.\r\n\r\n ­ A ghost   —   exactly.\r\n who does that?\r\n\r\n Us.\r\n\r\n Us?  right.\r\n\r\n And that,Sam   —   that is\r\n exactly why our lives suck.\r\n\r\n And that,Sam   —   that is\r\n exactly why our lives suck.\r\n\r\n I mean,come on.  we hunt monsters!\r\n\r\n I mean,come on.  we hunt monsters!\r\n\r\n What the hell?!\r\n\r\n What the hell?!\r\n\r\n I mean,normal people,they\r\n see a monster,and they run.\r\n\r\n I mean,normal people,they\r\n see a monster,and they run.\r\n\r\n But not us   —   no,no,no.\r\n we   —   we search out things\r\n\r\n that want to kill us.\r\n\r\n Yeah?  huh?  or eat us!\r\n\r\n ­ ­ You know who does\r\n that?  crazy people!\r\n\r\n We...are insane!\r\n\r\n You know,\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the bad diner\r\n food and then the skeevy motel rooms\r\n\r\n and then the truck-stop\r\n waitress with the bizarre rash.\r\n\r\n ­ I mean,who wants this life,Sam?\r\n\r\n Huh?  seriously?\r\n\r\n Do you actually like being stuck\r\n\r\n in a car with me eight hours a day,\r\n\r\nEvery single day?\r\n\r\n I don't think so!\r\n\r\n I mean,I drive too fast,\r\n\r\nAnd I listen to the same five albums\r\n\r\n over and over and over\r\n again, a-and I sing along.\r\n\r\n I'm annoying.I know that.\r\n\r\n and you   —  \r\n you're gassy!\r\n\r\n you eat half a\r\n burrito,and you get toxic!\r\n\r\n I mean,you know what?\r\n\r\n you can forget it.\r\n\r\n whoa,Dean.where  are you going?\r\n\r\n stay away from m Sam,okay?\r\n\r\n ­ cause I am done with it.\r\n\r\n I'm done with the monsters and\r\n —   and   —   and the hellhounds\r\n\r\n and the ghost sickness\r\n and the damn apocalypse.\r\n\r\n I'm out.
