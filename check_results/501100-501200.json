        "text":" My original design was targeted at < 200ms connection latencies.  People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience.  Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP.  This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum.  Client.  User's modem.  ISP's modem.  Server.  ISP's modem.  User's modem.  Client.  God, that sucks.\r\n\r\n Ok, I made a bad call.  I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familliar with PPP life.  I'm addressing it now.\r\n\r\n The problem was of course latency.\r\n\r\n What John did next when he released QuakeWorld would change the industry forever.\r\n\r\n Client-Side Prediction\r\n\r\n In the original Quake you felt the latency between your computer and the server.  Press forward and you’d wait however long it took for packets to travel to the server and back to you before you’d actually start moving.  Press fire and you wait for that same delay before shooting.\r\n\r\n If you’ve played any modern FPS like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, you know this is no longer what happens.  So how exactly do modern FPS games seem to remove the latency on your own actions in multiplayer?\r\n\r\n This problem was historically solved in two parts.  The first part was client-side prediction of movement developed by John Carmack for QuakeWorld, and later incorporated as part of Unreal’s networking model by Tim Sweeney.  The second part was latency compensation developed by Yahn Bernier at Valve for Counterstrike.  In this section we’ll focus on that first part – hiding the latency on player movement.\r\n\r\n When writing about his plans for the soon to be released QuakeWorld, John Carmack said:\r\n\r\nI am now allowing the client to guess at the results of the users movement until the authoritative response from the server comes through.  This is a biiiig architectural change.  The client now needs to know about solidity of objects, friction, gravity, etc.  I am sad to see the elegant client-as-terminal setup go away, but I am practical above idealistic.\r\n\r\n So now in order to remove the latency, the client runs more code than it previously did.  It is no longer a dumb terminal sending inputs to the server and interpolating between state sent back.  Instead it is able to predict the movement of your character locally and immediately in response to your input, running a subset of the game code for your player character on the client machine.\r\n\r\n Now as soon as you press forward, there is no wait for a round trip between client and server – your character start moving forward right away.\r\n\r\n The difficulty of this approach is not in the prediction, for the prediction works just as normal game code does – evolving the state of the game character forward in time according to the player’s input.  The difficulty is in applying the correction back from the server to resolve cases when the client and server disagree about where the player character should be and what it is doing.\r\n\r\n Now at this point you might wonder.  Hey, if you are running code on the client – why not just make the client authoritative over their player character?  The client could run the simulation code for their own character and simply tell the server where they are each time they send a packet.  The problem with this is that if each player were able to simply tell the server “here is my current position” it would be trivially easy to hack the client such that a cheater could instantly dodge the RPG about to hit them, or teleport instantly behind you to shoot you in the back.\r\n\r\n So in FPS games it is absolutely necessary that the server is the authoritative over the state of each player character, in-spite of the fact that each player is locally predicting the motion of their own character to hide latency.  As Tim Sweeney writes in The Unreal Networking Architecture: “The Server Is The Man”.\r\n\r\n Here is where it gets interesting.  If the client and the server disagree, the client must accept the update for the position from the server, but due to latency between the client and server this correction is necessarily in the past.  For example, if it takes 100ms from client to server and 100ms back, then any server correction for the player character position will appear to be 200ms in the past, relative to the time up to which the client has predicted their own movement.\r\n\r\n If the client were to simply apply this server correction update verbatim, it would yank the client back in time such that the client would completely undo any client-side prediction.  How then to solve this while still allowing the client to predict ahead?\r\n\r\n The solution is to keep a circular buffer of past character state and input for the local player on the client, then when the client receives a correction from the server, it first discards any buffered state older than the corrected state from the server, and replays the state starting from the corrected state back to the present “predicted” time on the client using player inputs stored in the circular buffer.  In effect the client invisibly “rewinds and replays” the last n frames of local player character movement while holding the rest of the world fixed.\r\n\r\n This way the player appears to control their own character without any latency, and provided that the client and server character simulation code is deterministic – giving exactly the same result for the same inputs on the client and server – it is rarely corrected.  It is as Tim Sweeney describes:\r\n\r\n… the best of both worlds: In all cases, the server remains completely authoritative.  Nearly all the time, the client movement simulation exactly mirrors the client movement carried out by the server, so the client’s position is seldom corrected.  Only in the rare case, such as a player getting hit by a rocket, or bumping into an enemy, will the client’s location need to be corrected.\r\n\r\n In other words, only when the player’s character is affected by something external to the local player’s input, which cannot possibly be predicted on the client, will the player’s position need to be corrected.  That and of course, if that player is attempting to cheat \r\n\r\n Further Reading\r\n\r\n UDP vs. TCP\r\n\r\n What is the best way to send data between machines?  Do you use TCP sockets, UDP sockets or a mixture of both?  In this article we explore this fundamental choice and decide on the best option for fast-paced action games.\r\n\r\n Sending and Receiving Packets\r\n\r\n This article shows how to send and receive UDP packets using BSD sockets, giving you source code that works across MacOS X, Windows and Unix.\r\n\r\n Virtual Connection over UDP\r\n\r\n Learn how to create your own virtual connection between two machines on top of UDP.

        "text":"Origins\r\n This book presents my current understanding of judgment and decision\r\n making, which has been shaped by psychological discoveries of recent\r\n decades.  However, I trace the central ideas to the lucky day in 1969 when I\r\n asked a colleague to speak as a guest to a seminar I was teaching in the\r\n Department of Psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Amos\r\n Tversky was considered a rising star in the field of decision research — \r\n indeed, in anything he did — so I knew we would have an interesting time.\r\n Many people who knew Amos thought he was the most intelligent person\r\n they had ever met.  He was brilliant, voluble, and charismatic.  He was also\r\n blessed with a perfect memory for jokes and an exceptional ability to use\r\n them to make a point.  There was never a dull moment when Amos was\r\n around.  He was then thirty-two;  I was thirty-five.\r\n Amos told the class about an ongoing program of research at the\r\n University of Michigan that sought to answer this question: Are people\r\n good intuitive statisticians?  We already knew that people are good\r\n intuitive grammarians: at age four a child effortlessly conforms to the rules\r\n of grammar as she speaks, although she has no idea that such rules exist.\r\n Do people have a similar intuitive feel for the basic principles of statistics?\r\n Amos reported that the answer was a qualified yes.  We had a lively debate\r\n in the seminar and ultimately concluded that a qualified no was a better\r\n answer.\r\n Amos and I enjoyed the exchange and concluded that intuitive statistics\r\n was an interesting topic and that it would be fun to explore it together.  That\r\n Friday we met for lunch at Café Rimon, the favorite hangout of bohemians\r\n and professors in Jerusalem, and planned a study of the statistical\r\n intuitions of sophisticated researchers.  We had concluded in the seminar\r\n that our own intuitions were deficient.  In spite of years of teaching and\r\n using statistics, we had not developed an intuitive sense of the reliability of\r\n statistical results observed in small samples.  Our subjective judgments\r\n were biased: we were far too willing to believe research findings based on\r\n inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own\r\n research.  The goal of our study was to examine whether other researchers\r\n suffered from the same affliction.\r\n We prepared a survey that included realistic scenarios of statistical\r\n issues that arise in research.  Amos collected the responses of a group of\r\n expert participants in a meeting of the Society of Mathematical\r\n Psychology, including the authors of two statistical textbooks.  As expected,\r\nwe found that our expert colleagues, like us, greatly exaggerated the\r\n likelihood that the original result of an experiment would be successfully\r\n replicated even with a small sample.  They also gave very poor advice to a\r\n fictitious graduate student about the number of observations she needed\r\n to collect.  Even statisticians were not good intuitive statisticians.\r\n While writing the article that reported these findings, Amos and I\r\n discovered that we enjoyed working together.  Amos was always very\r\n funny, and in his presence I became funny as well, so we spent hours of\r\n solid work in continuous amusement.  The pleasure we found in working\r\n together made us exceptionally patient;  it is much easier to strive for\r\n perfection when you are never bored.  Perhaps most important, we\r\n checked our critical weapons at the door.  Both Amos and I were critical\r\n"

In  his  asking,  Terrence\r\n Lowell Gull became a condemned bird, labeled Outcast;  and  the  eighth  of\r\n Jonathan's students.\r\n The next night from the Flock came Kirk Maynard Gull, wobbling across\r\n the sand, dragging his leftwing,to collapse at Jonathan's feet.  \"Help me,\"\r\n he said very quietly, speaking in the way that the dying speak.  \"I want to\r\n fly more than anything else in the world...\"\r\n \"Come along then.\"  said  Jonathan.   \"Climb  with  me  away  from  the\r\n ground, and we'll begin.\"\r\n \"You don't understand My wing.  I can't move my wing.\"\r\n \"Maynard Gull, you have the freedom to be yourself, your  true  self,\r\nhere and now, and nothing can stand in your way.It is the Law of the Great\r\n Gull, the Law that Is.\"\r\n \"Are you saying I can fly?\"\r\n \"I say you are free.\"\r\n As simply and as quickly as that, Kirk Maynard Gull spread his wings,\r\neffortlessly, and lifted into the dark night air.   The  Flock  was  roused\r\n from sleep by his cry, as loud as he could scream it,  from  five  hundred\r\n feet up: \"I can fly!  Listen!  I CAN FLY!\"\r\n By sunrise there were nearly a thousand birds  standing  outside  the\r\n circle of students, looking curiously at Maynard.  They didn't care whether\r\n they were seen or not, and they listened, trying  to  understand  Jonathan\r\n Seagull.\r\n He spoke of very simple things - that it is right for a guil to  fly,\r\nthat freedom is the very nature of his being, that whatever stands against\r\n that freedom must be set aside, be it ritual or superstition or limitation\r\n in any form.\r\n \"Set aside,\" came a voice from the multitude, \"even if it be the  Law\r\n of the Flock?\"\r\n \"The only true law is that which leads to  freedom,\"  Jonathan  said.\r\n \"There is no other.\"\r\n \"How do you expect us to fly as you fly?\"  came  another  voice.   \"You\r\n are special and gifted and divine, above other birds.\"\r\n \"Look at Fletcher!  Lowell!  Charles-Roland!  Judy Lee!   Are  they  also\r\n special and gifted and divine?  No more than you are, no more  than  I  am.\r\n The only difference, the very  only  one,  is  that  they  have  begun  to\r\n understand what they really are and have begun to practice it.\"\r\n His students, save Fletcher, shifted uneasily.  They  hadn't  realized\r\n that this was what they were doing.\r\n The crowd grew larger every day, coming to question, to  idolize,  to\r\n scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n \"They are saying in the Flock that if you are  not  the  Son  of  the\r\n Great Gull Himself,\" Fletcher told Jonathan  one  morning  after  Advanced\r\n Speed Practice, \"then you are a thousand years ahead of your time.\"\r\n Jonathan sighed.  The price of being misunderstood, he  thought.   They\r\n call you devil or they call you god.  \"What do you think,  Fletch?   Are  we\r\n ahead of our time?\"\r\n A long silence.  \"Well, this kind of flying has always been here to be\r\n learned by anybody who wanted to discover it;  that's  got  nothing  to  do\r\n with time.  We're ahead of the fashion, maybe, Ahead of the way  that  most\r\n gulls fly.\"\r\n \"That's something,\" Jonathan said rolling to  glide  inverted  for  a\r\n while.  \"That's not half as bad as being ahead of our time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n It happened  just  a  week  later.   Fletcher  was  demonstrating  the\r\n elements of high-speed flying to a class of  new  students.   He  had  just\r\n pulled out of his dive from seven thousand feet, a long gray streak firing\r\n a few inches above the beach, when a young bird on its first flight glided\r\n directly into his path, calling for its mother.  With a tenth of  a  second\r\n to avoid the youngster, Fletcher Lynd Seagull snapped hard to the left, at\r\n something over two hundred miles per hour, into a cliff of solid granite.\r\n It was, for him, as though the rock  were  a  giant  hard  door  into\r\n another world.  A burst of fear and shock and black as he hit, and then  he\r\n was adrift in a strange strange sky, forgetting, remembering,  forgetting;\r\n afraid and sad and sorry, terribly sorry.\r\n The voice came to him as it had in the first  day  that  he  had  met\r\n Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\r\n   \"The trick Fletcher is that we are trying to overcome our limitations\r\n in order, patiently, We don't tackle flying through rock  until  a  little\r\n later in the program.\"\r\n \"Jonathan!\" .\r\n \"Also known as the Son of the Great Gull \" his instructor said dryly,\r\n   \"What are you doing here?  The cliff!  Haven't I didn't I.. , die?\"\r\n \"Oh, Fletch, come on.  Think.  If you  are  talking  to  me  now,  then\r\n obviously you didn't die, did you?  What you did manage to do was to change\r\n your level of consciousness rather abruptly.  It's your choice now.  You can\r\n stay here and learn on this level - which is quite a bit higher  than  the\r\n one you left, by the way - or you can go back and keep  working  with  the\r\n Flock.  The Elders were hoping for  some  kind  of  disaster,  but  they're\r\n startled that you obliged them so well.\"\r\n \"I want to go back to the Flock, of course.  I've  barely  begun  with\r\n the new group!\"\r\n \"Very well, Fletcher.  Remember what we were saying about  one's  body\r\n being nothing more than thought itself....?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n Fletcher shook his head and stretched his wings and opened  his  eyes\r\n at the base of the cliff, in the center  of  the  whole  Flock  assembled.\r\n There was a great clamor of squawks and screes from the crowd  when  first\r\n he moved.\r\n \"He lives!  He that was dead lives!\"\r\n \"Touched him with a wingtip!  Brought him to  life!   The  Son  of  the\r\n Great Gull!\"\r\n \"No!  He denies it!  He's a devil!  DEVIL!  Come to break the Flock!\"\r\n There were four thousand gulls in the crowd, frightened at  what  had\r\n happened, and the cry DEVIL!  went through them like the wind of  an  ocean\r\n storm.  Eyes glazed, beaks sharp, they closed in to destroy.\r\n \"Would you feel better if we left, Fletcher?\"  asked Jonathan.\r\n \"I certainly wouldn't object too much if we did...\"\r\n Instantly they stood together a  half-mile  away,  and  the  flashing\r\n beaks of the mob closed on empty air.\r\n \"Why is it,\" Jonathan puzzled, \"that the hardest thing in  the  world\r\n is to convince a bird that he is free,  and  that  he  can  prove  it  for\r\n himself if he'd just spend a little time practicing?  Why should that be so\r\n hard?\"\r\n Fletcher still blinked from the change of scene.  \"What did  you  just\r\n do?  How did we get here?\"\r\n \"You did say you wanted to be out of the mob, didn't you?\"\r\n \"Yes!  But how did you...\"\r\n \"Like everything else, Fletcher.  Practice.\"  By morning the Flock  had\r\n forgotten its insanity, but Fletcher had not.  \"Jonathan, remember what you\r\n said a long time ago, about loving the Flock enough to return  to  it  and\r\n help it learn?\"\r\n \"Sure.\"\r\n \"I don't understand how you manage to love a mob of  birds  that  has\r\n just tried to kill you.\"\r\n \"Oh, Fletch, you don't love that!  You don't love hatred and evil,  of\r\n course.  You have to practice and see the real gull, the good in every  one\r\n of them, and to help them see it in themselves.   That's  what  I  mean  by\r\n love.  It's fun, when you get the knack of it.\r\n \"I remember a fierce young bird for instance, Fletcher Lynd  Seagull,\r\nhis name.  Just been made Outcast, ready to fight the Flock to  the  death,\r\ngetting a start on building his own bitter hell out on the Far Cliffs.  And\r\n here he is today building his own heaven instead, and  leading  the  whole\r\n Flock in that direction.\"\r\n Fletcher turned to his instructor, and there was a moment  of  fright\r\n in his eye.  \"Me  leading?   What  do  you  mean,  me  leading?   You're  the\r\n instructor here.  You couldn't leave!\"\r\n \"Couldn't I?  Don't you think that there might be other flocks,  other\r\n Fletchers, that need an instructor more than this one, that's on  its  way\r\n toward the light?\"\r\n \"Me?  Jon, I'm just a plain seagull and you're... \"\r\n \" ...the only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose?\"  Jonathan sighed  and\r\n looked out to sea.  \"You don't need me any longer.  You need to keep finding\r\n yourself, a little more each day, that real, unlimited  Fletcher  Seagull.\r\n He's your in structor.  You need to understand him and to practice him.\"\r\n A moment later Jonathan's body wavered in the  air,  shimmering,  and\r\n began to go transparent.  \"Don't let them spread silly rumors about me,  or\r\n make me a god.  O.K., Fletch?  I'm a seagull.  I like to fly, maybe...\"\r\n \"JONATHAN!\"\r\n \"Poor Fletch.  Don't believe what your eyes are telling you.  All  they\r\n show is limitation.  Look  with  your  understanding,  find  out  what  you\r\n already know, and you'll see the way to fly.\"\r\n The shimmering stopped.  Jonathan Seagull had vanished into empty air.\r\n After a time, Fletcher Gull dragged himself into the sky and faced  a\r\n brand-new group of students, eager for their first lesson.\r\n \"To begin with \" he said heavily, \"you've got to  understand  that  a\r\n seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great  Gull,  and\r\n your whole body, from wingtip  to  wingtip,  is  nothing  more  than  your\r\n thought itself.\"\r\n The young gulls looked at him quizzically.  Hey,  man,  they  thought,\r\nthis doesn't sound like a rule for a loop.\r\n Fletcher sighed and started over.  \"Hm.  Ah... very well,\" he said, and\r\n eyed them critically.  \"Let's begin with Level Flight.\"  And saying that, he\r\n understood all at once that his friend had quite  honestly  been  no  more\r\n divine than Fletcher himself.\r\n No limits, Jonathan?  he thought.  Well, then, the time's  not  distant\r\n when I'm going to appear out of thin air on your beach,  and  show  you  a\r\n thing or two about flying!\r\n And though he  tried  to  look  properly  severe  for  his  students,\r\nFletcher Seagull suddenly saw them all as they really  were,  just  for  a\r\n moment, and he more than liked, he loved what he saw.  No limits, Jonathan?\r\n he thought, and he smiled.  His race to learn had begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n 1973\r\n\r\n ———————————————————————————————-\r\n\r\n The New York Times, July 3, 1974\r\n\r\n Des Moines, Iowa, July 2 - John H.

One year later, Mambo was\r\n re-licensed under two separate licenses,  one of which was open source. \r\n The open-source version became known as 'Mambo Site Server'.\r\n In 2002 Mambo Site Server was re-branded 'Mambo Open Source' (Also referred to \r\n as MamboOS or MOS) in an attempt to differentiate the commercial and open-source \r\n flavors of Mambo.  All rights to Mambo Open Source were of\u0003cially released into the \r\n open-source community in 2003.\r\n Mambo Open Source was extremely successful and won a large number of \r\n prestigious open-source awards.\r\n In 2005 the commercial version of Mambo was re-branded as 'Jango'.  Rice Studios, \r\nat that time still Miro, also chose to form the Mambo Foundation, a non-pro\u0003t \r\n organization.  The intention was to create a body that would help protect the \r\n principles of Mambo and provide a more structured working methodology.\r\n The creation of the Mambo Foundation created a rift in the Mambo Open Source \r\n community.  The creation of the Mambo Foundation was seen by many as an attempt \r\n by Rice Studios to gain control of the Mambo Open Source project.\r\n Not long after the Mambo Foundation was created, a group, consisting mainly of \r\n the Mambo Open Source core developers, publicly announced that they intended to \r\n abandon Mambo Open Source.  The group formed a non-pro\u0003t organization called \r\n 'Open Source Matters'.\r\n Open Source Matters created the Joomla!  project, a guaranteed 100% open-source \r\n GPL project.  The \u0003rst release of Joomla!  (Joomla!  1.0) was very similar to the then \r\n current release of Mambo, the majority of extensions at the time being compatible \r\n with both.\r\n Restraints within Joomla!  1.0 led to a complete re-think of how Joomla!  should be \r\n constructed.  After a long development period, and two beta releases, Joomla!  1.5 was \r\n released in mid 2007.\r\n Joomla!  1.5 is extensively different to Joomla!  1.0 and Mambo.  Joomla!  1.5 introduces \r\n many new classes and implements a comprehensive framework.  These changes have \r\n lead to reduced compatibility between Joomla!  and Mambo.\r\n The most notable change, for most third-party extension developers, is the \r\n introduction of the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern in components. \r\n These changes now mean that all third-party developers tend to develop for Joomla! \r\n or Mambo, but not both"

MSL will deliver Curiosity to Mars at approximately 1:31 a.m.  Eastern on Aug. 6.  When it does land, Curiosity will then use a suite of laboratory instruments to analyze samples of rocks, soil and the atmosphere, in an effort to determine whether Mars is, or ever was able to sustain microbial life. \r\n\r\n John Grotzinger, Mars Science Laboratory Project Scientist: \r\n\r\n“This is going to be a mission that requires a lot of patience.  And as a scientist, this is not something for which there is a slam-dunk discovery, but many bits of information come together to build this and it's going to take us a while to get there.” \r\n\r\n Unveiled during the briefing was a new Xbox 360 game developed in collaboration with Microsoft called “Mars Rover Landing.”  Users take control of their own spacecraft while facing the extreme challenges of landing a rover in a specific location on Mars.  The “Mars Rover Landing” game is free and is available for download at the Xbox Marketplace. \r\n\r\n =================================\r\n J-2X GOES THE DISTANCE – SSC/MSFC \r\n =================================\r\n\r\n A 550-second test of the J-2X rocket engine has been successfully conducted on the A-2 Test Stand at the Stennis Space Center.  It was the first flight-duration test of the engine's nozzle extension, a bell-shaped device designed to increase engine performance.  The J-2X will power the upper-stage of NASA’s planned two-stage Space Launch System, the SLS, which will propel the Orion crew capsule beyond low Earth orbit.  This test is the latest in a series of firings to gather critical data for development of the J-2X. \r\n\r\n =========================\r\n WELL-SUITED ‘CHUTES – JSC \r\n =========================\r\n\r\n In Yuma, Arizona, NASA completed another successful drop test of the Orion crew capsule’s parachutes.  This was the first such test using an actual-size Orion test article.  The vehicle was dropped from a C-17 plane at an altitude of about 25-thousand feet.  The main objective was to see how the system would respond if one of the three main ‘chutes inflated too quickly.  It’s another milestone on the road to Orion’s orbital flight test, Exploration Flight Test -1, scheduled for 2014. \r\n\r\n ==========================\r\n HOME AWAY FROM HOME – JSC \r\n ==========================\r\n\r\n Expedition 32/33 Soyuz Commander Yuri Malenchenko, NASA Flight Engineer Suni Williams and Flight Engineer Aki Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are settling into their new digs aboard the International Space Station.  The trio was welcomed aboard the orbiting laboratory by station Commander Gennady Padalka, NASA Flight Engineer Joe Acaba and Russian Flight Engineer Sergei Revin.  The docking of their spacecraft came on the 37th anniversary of the historic link up of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft in 1975 that began U.S.-Russian cooperation in human spaceflight. \r\n\r\n ============================\r\n SCIENCE SUPPORTERS – MSFC \r\n ============================\r\n\r\n International Space Station Program Scientist Julie Robinson was at the Marshall Space Flight Center’s Payload Operations Center to encourage ISS Ambassadorship among employees.  Robinson is traveling to NASA centers to promote a better understanding of the research and technology development being done in the world’s only laboratory in microgravity. \r\n\r\n Julie Robinson, International Space Station Program Scientist: \r\n\r\n“Those scientific discoveries and the way that they benefit us here on Earth are really some of the most important messages that NASA needs to share with our taxpayers about how valuable the space station is and how much it’s driving our economy.  So we’re just trying to make sure that our own employees know those messages and then we’re also trying to share them with the world.” \r\n\r\n The Payload Operations Center at Marshall coordinates all research activities aboard the station. \r\n\r\n ============================\r\n SPACE SOJOURN – GSFC \r\n ============================\r\n\r\n NASA astronaut Dan Burbank visited Goddard Space Flight Center to share experiences from his five-month stay aboard the ISS as a member of the Expedition 29 and 30 crews. \r\n\r\n Dan Burbank, NASA Astronaut: \r\n\r\n“If you ride a rocket to space, as soon as the engines quit – within the first hour you’re already becoming a creature of space.  Your body is doing exactly what it needs to do to optimize all of the resources you have to live in this new, novel environment that it finds itself in.” \r\n\r\n Burbank and his crewmates, Anton Shkaplerov and Anatoly Ivanishin, returned to Earth on April 27. \r\n\r\n =========================\r\n AERO DAY ON THE HILL – HQ \r\n =========================\r\n\r\n Aero Day on the Hill provided an opportunity for representatives of NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate to visit Capitol Hill and brief members of Congress on the research the agency is conducting to make air transportation more efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly. \r\n\r\n Jaiwon Shin, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate: \r\n\r\n“We are setting the vision for the country.  We are leading the aeronautics community, so it’s all about direct tangible compelling benefits that you can enjoy today and for years to come.” \r\n\r\n ARMD works to solve the challenges that exist in our nation's air transportation system through innovative technical concepts, and dedicated research and development. \r\n\r\n ===========================\r\n ENTERPRISE TAKES BOW – HQ \r\n ===========================\r\n\r\n Space Shuttle Enterprise made its official debut before New York’s public as the centerpiece of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum’s newest attraction, “Space Shuttle Pavilion”. \r\n\r\n Charles Bolden, NASA Administrator: \r\n\r\n“Today we turn Enterprise over to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.  This magnificent machine is a tangible example that our dreams of exploration, of reaching our higher potential are always within our reach if we try for them.” \r\n\r\n Also part of the Grand Opening Celebration – a host of NASA exhibits, displays, and educational demonstrations showcasing the past, present and future of aeronautics and space exploration.  Event guests met and mingled with a number of current and former NASA astronauts. \r\n\r\n =============================\r\n JFK’S SPACE RACE – KSC (CP) \r\n TBD Reporting \r\n =============================\r\n\r\n Noted space historian John Logsdon spoke at the Kennedy Space Center to detail some of the decisions then-President John F. Kennedy made to set the nation on a course to send astronauts to the moon. \r\n\r\n John Logsdon, Author, John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon: \r\n\r\n“It was the Gagarin flight and in particular the domestic and international reaction to the Gagarin flight that stimulated Kennedy to pay attention to human spaceflight and as he paid attention to come to realize the symbolic importance of not being in a leading position.” \r\n\r\n Logsdon said Kennedy made defining contributions to keep the Apollo program on course during the rest of his presidency. \r\n\r\n John Logsdon, Author, John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon: \r\n\r\n“Get to the moon before the Soviets, that was Kennedy's overriding motivation.” \r\n\r\n Logsdon, who has written extensively about the American space program and space policy, said the president spoke often about involving the Soviet Union in a joint venture to the moon, even going as far as to propose the idea before the United Nations. \r\n\r\n John Logsdon, Author, John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon: \r\n\r\n“Kennedy's first choice would have been to cooperate.  From the start.” \r\n “It was Khruschev that said no.” \r\n\r\n Of course, Apollo 11 met Kennedy’s challenge by putting two men on the moon before the end of the 19-60s.  And, six years later, the United States and Russia began their cooperation in human spaceflight that eventually led to our partnership on the International Space Station. \r\n\r\n ================================\r\n NASA ANNIVERSARY: \r\nJuly 20, APOLLO 11 and VIKING 1 \r\n ================================\r\n\r\n “more forward drifting to the right a little ….  30 seconds … contact light.  Ok engines stop.  Tranquility base here … the Eagle has landed.” \r\n\r\n July 20 marks two important events in NASA history.  Forty-three years ago, on that date in 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin helped NASA accomplish the challenge set forth by President Kennedy of putting Americans on the moon before 1970 when the duo became the first humans to step foot on another heavenly body.  While Armstrong and Aldrin collected the first lunar soil and rock samples on the surface, command module pilot Michael Collins kept vigil in the Columbia module orbiting above.  The three reunited and landed safely in the Pacific Ocean four days later. \r\n\r\n And 36 years ago, on July 20, 1976, the Viking 1 Lander separated from the Orbiter and touched down at Chryse Planitia to become the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars and perform its mission.  Together with Viking 2, which landed a month later, the orbiter imaged the entire surface of the Red Planet, transmitting high resolution photographs of its terrain that characterized the structure and makeup of its atmosphere.  Viking 1 also took and analyzed surface samples for composition and signs of life.  Much like its successors, the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, the Viking spacecraft were designed for 90-day missions but produced valuable data for years. \r\n\r\n ==============================\r\n NASA ANNIVERSARY: July 23, 1972 – \r\n Launch of LandSat 1 \r\n ==============================\r\n\r\n Forty years ago, on July 23, 1972, NASA, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey launched the first Landsat satellite from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base.  Known at that time as the Earth Resources Technology Satellite, it was the first Earth-observing satellite launched with the expressed intent to study and monitor our planet's landmasses.  Landsat 1 operated until January 1978, five years past its designed life span.  Five Landsat satellites have since been sent into orbit.  The program represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based, moderate-resolution, land remote sensing data — imagery that provides a unique resource for everything from agriculture and geology to education and emergency response and disaster relief. \r\n\r\n ===============================\r\n And that’s This Week @NASA! \r\n\r\n For more on these and other stories, or to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and other social media, log on to www.nasa.gov."

        "text":"Tools, sometimes referred to as extensions, are essentially any type of extension \r\n that does not fall into the extension type categories just described.  We will not be \r\n discussing how to create tools in this book. \r\n Extensions are distributed in archive Ȣles, which include an XML manifest file that \r\n describes the extension.  It is from the manifest file that Joomla!  is able to determine \r\n what type the extension is, what it is called, what files are included, and what \r\n installation procedures are required.\r\n\r\n Components\r\n Components are undoubtedly the most fundamental Joomla!  extensions.  Whenever \r\n Joomla!  is invoked a component is always called upon.  Unlike other extensions, \r\noutput created by a component is displayed in the main content area.  Since \r\n components are the most fundamental extension, they are also generally the  \r\n most complex.\r\n One component of which all Joomla!  administrators will be aware, is the content \r\n component.  This component is used to display articles, content categories, and \r\n content sections.\r\n In addition to outputting component data as part of an XHTML page, we can output \r\n component data as Feeds, PDF, and RAW documents.\r\n Many components tend to include, and sometimes require, additional extensions \r\n in order for them to behave as expected.  When we create our own components \r\n it is generally good practice to add 'hooks' in our code, which will enable other \r\n extensions to easily enhance our component beyond its base functionality.\r\n\r\n Modules\r\n Modules are used to display small pieces of content, usually to the left, right, top or \r\n bottom of a rendered page.  There are a number of core modules with which we will \r\n be instantly familiar, for example the menu modules.\r\n\r\n Plugins\r\n There are various types of plugin, each of which can be used differently;  however, \r\nmost plugins are event driven.  Plugins can attach listener functions and classes to \r\n specific events that Joomla!  can throw using the global event dispatcher.\r\n This table describes the different core plugin types:\r\nPlugin Type       Description\r\n authentication      Authenticate users during the login process\r\n content           Process content items before they are displayed\r\n editors          WYSIWYG editors that can be used to edit content\r\n editors-xtd        Editor extensions (normally additional editor buttons)\r\n search         Search data when using the search component\r\n system         System event listeners\r\n user            Process a user when actions are performed\r\n xmlrpc         Create XML-RPC responses\r\n In addition to the core plugin types we can deȢne our own types.  Many components \r\n use their own plugins for dealing with their own events.\r\n\r\n Languages\r\n Joomla!  has multilingual support, which enables us to present Joomla!  in many \r\n different languages.  Language extensions include Ȣles that deȢne translated strings \r\n for different parts of Joomla! .\r\n We will discuss how to create language Ȣles and how to use translations in Chapter 2 \r\n and Chapter 9.\r\n\r\n Templates\r\n We use templates to modify the general appearance of Joomla! .  There are two types \r\n of template extension: site templates and admin templates.\r\n Most Joomla!  sites use bespoke site templates to modify the appearance of the \r\n frontend (what the end-user sees).  Admin templates modify the appearance of the \r\n backend (what the administrators see);  these templates are less common.\r\n There are many websites that offer free and commercial Joomla!  templates, all of \r\n which are easy to locate using a search engine.\r\n\r\n Tools\r\n Tools, although referred to as extensions, are very different to components, modules, \r\nand plugins.  The term 'tools' is used to describe any other type extension that can be \r\n used in conjunction with Joomla! .\r\n Introduction to Joomla!\r\n\r\n Tools are not installed to Joomla! ;  they are generally standalone scripts or \r\n applications, which may, or may not, require their own form of installation.\r\n A good example of a Joomla!  tool is JSAS (Joomla!  Stand Alone Server).  JSAS \r\n provides an easy way to set up Joomla!  installations on a Windows-based system.  To \r\n learn more about JSAS please refer to http://jsas.joomlasolutions.com.\r\n\r\n Extension Manager\r\n Joomla!  uses the extension manager to manage extensions that are currently installed \r\n and to install new extensions.  When we install new extensions we use the same \r\n installation mechanism irrespective of the extension type.  Joomla!  automatically \r\n identifies the type of extension during the extension installation phase.\r\n\r\n JED and JoomlaCode.org\r\n JED (Joomla!  Extension Directory) is an ofȢcial part of Joomla!  and is maintained by \r\n the 'Sites and Infrastructure' working group.  The directory categorizes details of third-\r\n party Joomla!  extensions on which users are allowed to post reviews and ratings.\r\n Details of extensions that are listed in JED are submitted and maintained by the \r\n extension owner or developer.  A listed extension can include a category, name, \r\ndescription, homepage, image, license, version, download link, demonstration link, \r\ndevelopers name, email address, and Joomla!  version compatibility information.\r\n JED is the normal place where administrators look for extensions for their Joomla! \r\n installation.  Before we create new extensions it is good practice to investigate any \r\n similar existing extensions;  JED is the perfect place to begin.  If we intend to make an \r\n extension publicly available JED is one of the best places to advertise an extension.\r\n\r\n Another invaluable resource is the developers' forge: http://www.joomlacode.org."

        "text":"and argumentative, he even more than I, but during the years of our\r\n collaboration neither of us ever rejected out of hand anything the other\r\n said.  Indeed, one of the great joys I found in the collaboration was that\r\n Amos frequently saw the point of my vague ideas much more clearly than I\r\n did.  Amos was the more logical thinker, with an orientation to theory and\r\n an unfailing sense of direction.  I was more intuitive and rooted in the\r\n psychology of perception, from which we borrowed many ideas.  We were\r\n sufficiently similar to understand each other easily, and sufficiently different\r\n to surprise each other.  We developed a routine in which we spent much of\r\n our working days together, often on long walks.  For the next fourteen years\r\n our collaboration was the focus of our lives, and the work we did together\r\n during those years was the best either of us ever did.\r\n We quickly adopted a practice that we maintained for many years.  Our\r\n research was a conversation, in which we invented questions and jointly\r\n examined our intuitive answers.  Each question was a small experiment,\r\nand we carried out many experiments in a single day.  We were not\r\n seriously looking for the correct answer to the statistical questions we\r\n posed.  Our aim was to identify and analyze the intuitive answer, the first\r\n one that came to mind, the one we were tempted to make even when we\r\n knew it to be wrong.  We believed — correctly, as it happened — that any\r\n intuition that the two of us shared would be shared by many other people\r\n as well, and that it would be easy to demonstrate its effects on judgments.\r\n We once discovered with great delight that we had identical silly ideas\r\n about the future professions of several toddlers we both knew.  We could\r\n identify the argumentative three-year-old lawyer, the nerdy professor, the\r\n empathetic and mildly intrusive psychotherapist.  Of course these\r\n predictions were absurd, but we still found them appealing.  It was also\r\n clear that our intuitions were governed by the resemblance of each child to\r\n the cultural stereotype of a profession.  The amusing exercise helped us\r\n develop a theory that was emerging in our minds at the time, about the role\r\n of resemblance in predictions.  We went on to test and elaborate that\r\n theory in dozens of experiments, as in the following example.\r\n As you consider the next question, please assume that Steve was\r\n selected at random from a representative sample:\r\nAn individual has been described by a neighbor as follows:\r\n“Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably helpful but with little\r\n interest in people or in the world of reality.  A meek and tidy soul,\r\nhe has a need for order and structurut and stre, and a passion for\r\n detail.”  Is Steve more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?\r\n The resemblance of Steve’s personality to that of a stereotypical librarian\r\n strikes everyone immediately, but equally relevant statistical\r\n considerations are almost always ignored.  Did it occur to you that there\r\n are more than 20 male farmers for each male librarian in the United\r\n States?  Because there are so many more farmers, it is almost certain that\r\n more “meek and tidy” souls will be found on tractors than at library\r\n information desks.  However, we found that participants in our experiments\r\n ignored the relevant statistical facts and relied exclusively on resemblance.\r\n We proposed that they used resemblance as a simplifying heuristic\r\n (roughly, a rule of thumb) to make a difficult judgment.  The reliance on the\r\n heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their\r\n predictions.\r\n On another occasion, Amos and I wondered about the rate of divorce\r\n among professors in our university.  We noticed that the question triggered\r\n a search of memory for divorced professors we knew or knew about, and\r\n that we judged the size of categories by the ease with which instances\r\n came to mind.  We called this reliance on the ease of memory search the\r\n availability heuristic.  In one of our studies, we asked participants to answer\r\n a simple question about words in a typical English text:\r\nConsider the letter K.\r\n Is K more likely to appear as the first letter in a word OR as the\r\n third letter?\r\n As any Scrabble player knows, it is much easier to come up with words\r\n that begin with a particular letter than to find words that have the same\r\n letter in the third position.  This is true for every letter of the alphabet.  We\r\n therefore expected respondents to exaggerate the frequency of letters\r\n appearing in the first position — even those letters (such as K, L, N, R, V)\r\n which in fact occur more frequently in the third position.  Here again, the\r\n reliance on a heuristic produces a predictable bias in judgments.  For\r\n example, I recently came to doubt my long-held impression that adultery is\r\n more common among politicians than among physicians or lawyers.  I had\r\n even come up with explanations for that “fact,” including the aphrodisiac\r\n effect of power and the temptations of life away from home.  I eventually\r\n realized that the transgressions of politicians are much more likely to be\r\n reported than the transgressions of lawyers and doctors.  My intuitive\r\n impression could be due entirely to journalists’ choices of topics and to my\r\n reliance on the availability heuristic.\r\n Amos and I spent several years studying and documenting biases of\r\n intuitive thinking in various tasks — assigning probabilities to events,\r\nforecasting the future, assessing hypotheses, and estimating frequencies.\r\n In the fifth year of our collaboration, we presented our main findings in\r\n Science magazine, a publication read by scholars in many disciplines.  The\r\n article (which is reproduced in full at the end of this book) was titled\r\n “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.”  It described the\r\n simplifying shortcuts of intuitive thinking and explained some 20 biases as\r\n manifestations of these heuristics — and also as demonstrations of the role\r\n of heuristics in judgment.\r\n Historians of science have often noted that at any given time scholars in\r\n a particular field tend to share basic re share assumptions about their\r\n subject.  Social scientists are no exception;  they rely on a view of human\r\n nature that provides the background of most discussions of specific\r\n behaviors but is rarely questioned.  Social scientists in the 1970s broadly\r\n accepted two ideas about human nature.  First, people are generally\r\n rational, and their thinking is normally sound.  Second, emotions such as\r\n fear, affection, and hatred explain most of the occasions on which people\r\n depart from rationality.  Our article challenged both assumptions without\r\n discussing them directly.  We documented systematic errors in the thinking\r\n of normal people, and we traced these errors to the design of the\r\n machinery of cognition rather than to the corruption of thought by emotion.\r\n Our article attracted much more attention than we had expected, and it\r\n remains one of the most highly cited works in social science (more than\r\n three hundred scholarly articles referred to it in 2010).  Scholars in other\r\n disciplines found it useful, and the ideas of heuristics and biases have\r\n been used productively in many fields, including medical diagnosis, legal\r\n judgment, intelligence analysis, philosophy, finance, statistics, and military\r\n strategy.\r\n For example, students of policy have noted that the availability heuristic\r\n helps explain why some issues are highly salient in the public’s mind while\r\n others are neglected.  People tend to assess the relative importance of\r\n issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory — and this is\r\n largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.  Frequently\r\n mentioned topics populate the mind even as others slip away from\r\n awareness.  In turn, what the media choose to report corresponds to their\r\n view of what is currently on the public’s mind.  It is no accident that\r\n authoritarian regimes exert substantial pressure on independent media.\r\n Because public interest is most easily aroused by dramatic events and by\r\n celebrities, media feeding frenzies are common.  For several weeks after\r\n Michael Jackson’s death, for example, it was virtually impossible to find a\r\n television channel reporting on another topic.  In contrast, there is little\r\n coverage of critical but unexciting issues that provide less drama, such as\r\n declining educational standards or overinvestment of medical resources in\r\n the last year of life.  (As I write this, I notice that my choice of “little-covered”\r\n examples was guided by availability.  The topics I chose as examples are\r\n mentioned often;  equally important issues that are less available did not\r\n come to my mind.)\r\n We did not fully realize it at the time, but a key reason for the broad\r\n appeal of “heuristics and biases” outside psychology was an incidental\r\n feature of our work: we almost always included in our articles the full text of\r\n the questions we had asked ourselves and our respondents.  These\r\n questions served as demonstrations for the reader, allowing him to\r\n recognize how his own thinking was tripped up by cognitive biases.  I hope\r\n you had such an experience as you read the question about Steve the\r\n librarian, which was intended to help you appreciate the power of\r\n resemblance as a cue to probability and to see how easy it is to ignore\r\n relevant statistical facts.\r\n The use of demonstrations provided scholars from diverse disciplines — \r\n notably philosophers and economists — an unusual opportunity to observe\r\n possible flaws in their own thinking.  Having seen themselves fail, they\r\n became more likely to question the dogmatic assumption, prevalent at the\r\n time, that the human mind is rational and logical.  The choice of method\r\n was crucial: if we had reported results of only conventional experiments,\r\nthe article would have been less noteworthy and less memorable.\r\n Furthermore, skeptical readers would have distanced themselves from the\r\n results by attributing judgment errors to the familiar l the famifecklessness\r\n of undergraduates, the typical participants in psychological studies.  Of\r\n course, we did not choose demonstrations over standard experiments\r\n because we wanted to influence philosophers and economists.  We\r\n preferred demonstrations because they were more fun, and we were lucky\r\n in our choice of method as well as in many other ways.  A recurrent theme\r\n of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success;  it is\r\n almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have\r\n turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome.  Our story was\r\n no exception.\r\n The reaction to our work was not uniformly positive.  In particular, our\r\n focus on biases was criticized as suggesting an unfairly negative view of\r\n the mind.  As expected in normal science, some investigators refined our\r\n ideas and others offered plausible alternatives.  By and large, though, the\r\n idea that our minds are susceptible to systematic errors is now generally\r\n accepted.  Our research on judgment had far more effect on social science\r\n than we thought possible when we were working on it.\r\n Immediately after completing our review of judgment, we switched our\r\n attention to decision making under uncertainty.  Our goal was to develop a\r\n psychological theory of how people make decisions about simple\r\n gambles.  For example: Would you accept a bet on the toss of a coin where\r\n you win $130 if the coin shows heads and lose $100 if it shows tails?\r\n These elementary choices had long been used to examine broad\r\n questions about decision making, such as the relative weight that people\r\n assign to sure things and to uncertain outcomes.  Our method did not\r\n change: we spent many days making up choice problems and examining\r\n whether our intuitive preferences conformed to the logic of choice.  Here\r\n again, as in judgment, we observed systematic biases in our own\r\n decisions, intuitive preferences that consistently violated the rules of\r\n rational choice.  Five years after the Science article, we published\r\n “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk,” a theory of choice\r\n that is by some counts more influential than our work on judgment, and is\r\n one of the foundations of behavioral economics.\r\n Until geographical separation made it too difficult to go on, Amos and I\r\n enjoyed the extraordinary good fortune of a shared mind that was superior\r\n to our individual minds and of a relationship that made our work fun as well\r\n as productive.  Our collaboration on judgment and decision making was the\r\n reason for the Nobel Prize that I received in 2002, which Amos would have\r\n shared had he not died, aged fifty-nine, in 1996."

        "text":"Where we are now\r\n This book is not intended as an exposition of the early research that Amos\r\n and I conducted together, a task that has been ably carried out by many\r\n authors over the years.  My main aim here is to present a view of how the\r\n mind works that draws on recent developments in cognitive and social\r\n psychology.  One of the more important developments is that we now\r\n understand the marvels as well as the flaws of intuitive thought.\r\n Amos and I did not address accurate intuitions beyond the casual\r\n statement that judgment heuristics “are quite useful, but sometimes lead to\r\n severe and systematic errors.”  We focused on biases, both because we\r\n found them interesting in their own right and because they provided\r\n evidence for the heuristics of judgment.  We did not ask ourselves whether\r\n all intuitive judgments under uncertainty are produced by the heuristics we\r\n studied;  it is now clear that they are not.  In particular, the accurate intuitions\r\n of experts are better explained by the effects of prolonged practice than by\r\n heuristics.  We can now draw a richer andigha riche more balanced\r\n picture, in which skill and heuristics are alternative sources of intuitive\r\n judgments and choices.\r\n The psychologist Gary Klein tells the story of a team of firefighters that\r\n entered a house in which the kitchen was on fire.  Soon after they started\r\n hosing down the kitchen, the commander heard himself shout, “Let’s get\r\n out of here!”  without realizing why.  The floor collapsed almost immediately\r\n after the firefighters escaped.  Only after the fact did the commander realize\r\n that the fire had been unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually\r\n hot.  Together, these impressions prompted what he called a “sixth sense\r\n of danger.”  He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was\r\n wrong.  It turned out that the heart of the fire had not been in the kitchen but\r\n in the basement beneath where the men had stood.\r\n We have all heard such stories of expert intuition: the chess master who\r\n walks past a street game and announces “White mates in three” without\r\n stopping, or the physician who makes a complex diagnosis after a single\r\n glance at a patient.  Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not.\r\n Indeed, each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times each\r\n day.  Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a\r\n telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of\r\n the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car\r\n in the next lane is dangerous.  Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less\r\n marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or\r\n physician — only more common.\r\n The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic.  Perhaps the\r\n best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess\r\n masters and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to\r\n see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us.  You can feel\r\n Simon’s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he\r\n writes: “The situation has provided a cue;  this cue has given the expert\r\n access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the\r\n answer.  Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”\r\n We are not surprised when a two-year-old looks at a dog and says\r\n “doggie!”  because we are used to the miracle of children learning to\r\n recognize and name things.  Simon’s point is that the miracles of expert\r\n intuition have the same character.  Valid intuitions develop when experts\r\n have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in\r\n a manner that is appropriate to it.  Good intuitive judgments come to mind\r\n with the same immediacy as “doggie!”\r\n Unfortunately, professionals’ intuitions do not all arise from true\r\n expertise.  Many years ago I visited the chief investment officer of a large\r\n financial firm, who told me that he had just invested some tens of millions of\r\n dollars in the stock of Ford Motor Company.  When I asked how he had\r\n made that decision, he replied that he had recently attended an automobile\r\n show and had been impressed.  “Boy, do they know how to make a car!”\r\n was his explanation.  He made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling\r\n and was satisfied with himself and with his decision.  I found it remarkable\r\n that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist\r\n would call relevant: Is Ford stock currently underpriced?  Instead, he had\r\n listened to his intuition;  he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he\r\n liked the idea of owning its stock.  From what we know about the accuracy\r\n of stock picking, it is reasonable to believe that he did not know what he\r\n was doing.\r\n The specific heuristics that Amos and I studied proviheitudied de little\r\n help in understanding how the executive came to invest in Ford stock, but a\r\n broader conception of heuristics now exists, which offers a good account.\r\n An important advance is that emotion now looms much larger in our\r\n understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past.\r\n The executive’s decision would today be described as an example of the\r\n affect heuristic, where judgments and decisions are guided directly by\r\n feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning.\r\n When confronted with a problem — choosing a chess move or deciding\r\n whether to invest in a stock — the machinery of intuitive thought does the\r\n best it can.  If the individual has relevant expertise, she will recognize the\r\n situation, and the intuitive solution that comes to her mind is likely to be\r\n correct.  This is what happens when a chess master looks at a complex\r\n position: the few moves that immediately occur to him are all strong.  When\r\n the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still\r\n has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly — but it is not an answer\r\n to the original question.  The question that the executive faced (should I\r\n invest in Ford stock?)  was difficult, but the answer to an easier and related\r\n question (do I like Ford cars?)  came readily to his mind and determined\r\n his choice.  This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a\r\n difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without\r\n noticing the substitution.\r\n The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails — \r\n neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind.  In such\r\n cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and\r\n effortful form of thinking.  This is the slow thinking of the title.  Fast thinking\r\n includes both variants of intuitive thought — the expert and the heuristic — as\r\n well as the entirely automatic mental activities of perception and memory,\r\nthe operations that enable you to know there is a lamp on your desk or\r\n retrieve the name of the capital of Russia.\r\n The distinction between fast and slow thinking has been explored by\r\n many psychologists over the last twenty-five years.  For reasons that I\r\n explain more fully in the next chapter, I describe mental life by the metaphor\r\n of two agents, called System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce\r\n fast and slow thinking.  I speak of the features of intuitive and deliberate\r\n thought as if they were traits and dispositions of two characters in your\r\n mind.  In the picture that emerges from recent research, the intuitive System\r\n 1 is more influential than your experience tells you, and it is the secret\r\n author of many of the choices and judgments you make.  Most of this book\r\n is about the workings of System 1 and the mutual influences between it\r\n and System 2."

        "text":"Getting Started\r\n\r\n This chapter explains some of the fundamental concepts behind Joomla! .  It describes \r\n the process from request to response.  We touch lightly on some of the coding aspects \r\n and explain how to use some of the more common Joomla!  elements.\r\n The Application and Document\r\n The application is a global object used to process a request.  The two application \r\n classes that we are interested in are JSite and JAdministrator.  Joomla!  uses JSite and \r\n JAdministrator to process frontend and backend requests respectively.  Application \r\n classes extend the abstract base class JApplication;  much of the functionality of JSite \r\n and JAdministrator is the same.\r\n The document is a global object used to buffer a response.  There are a number of \r\n different documents: HTML, PDF, RAW, feed, and error.  The HTML document uses \r\n the site templates and renders an XHTML page.  The PDF document renders content \r\n in as a PDF Getting Started\r\n [ 18 ]\r\n The application object is always stored in the $mainframe variable.  The application \r\n object is a global variable, which can be accessed from within functions and methods \r\n by declaring $mainframe global:\r\n/**\r\n * Pass-through method to check for admin application.\r\n *\r\n * @access public\r\n * @return boolean True if application is JAdministrator\r\n */\r\n function isAdmin()\r\n {\r\n global $mainframe;\r\n return $mainframe->isAdmin();\r\n }\r\n Unlike the application, to access the global document object we use the static \r\n JFactory::getInstance() method:\r\n$document =& JFactory::getDocument();\r\n Note that we use the =& assignment operator to retrieve the document. \r\n This ensures that we get a reference to the global document object and \r\n that we do not create a copy of the object.\r\n\r\n Request to Response\r\n Frontend and backend requests are placed with the root index.php  and \r\n administrator/index. php entry points respectively.  When we create extensions \r\n for Joomla! , we must never create any new entry points.  By using the normal entry \r\n points, we are guaranteeing that we are not circumventing any security or other \r\n important procedures.\r\n\r\n The Process\r\n To help describe the way in which the frontend entry points process a request, we \r\n use a series of flow charts.  The processes involving the backend are very similar.\r\n The first flow chart describes the overall process at a high level in seven generic \r\n steps.  The following six flow charts describe the first six of these generic steps in \r\n detail.  We do not look at the seventh step in detail because it is relatively simple and \r\n the framework handles it entirely.\r\n\r\n URI Structure\r\n During Joomla!  installation, we send URIs (Uniform Resource Indicators) packed full \r\n of useful query data.   Before we delve into data and its uses, the following diagram \r\n will describe the different parts of a URI:\r\nThe query element is the part of the URI from which we retrieve the data.  Query data \r\n is composed of a series of key-value pairs each separated by an ampersand.\r\n The first query value we will look at is option.  This value determines the \r\n component being requested.  Component names are always prexed with com_.  In \r\n this example, we access the component named example:\r\nhttp://www.example.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_example\r\n The menus are the primary means by which users navigate the Joomla!  interface. \r\n Menus consist of a number of menu items, each of which defines a link to a component \r\n (internal) or a URI (external).  We can also modify menu items by changing parameters \r\n specific to the chosen component, and assigning templates to them.\r\n A unique ID identifies every menu item.  The ID enables us to invoke a component \r\n without using the query option value.  Instead, we can use the Itemid query value. \r\n This value also serves a secondary purpose;  when the menu item ID is known, the \r\n menu item can be highlighted and any submenu items are displayed (depending on \r\n the exact setup of the installation).  In this example, we invoke menu item 1:\r\nhttp://www.example.org/joomla/index.php?Itemid=1\r\n Some components can output data in different formats.  If we want to output data \r\n in a different format, we can use the query value format.  This will only work if \r\n the component we are accessing supports the specified format.  In this example, we \r\n invoke component example and request the data in feed format:\r\nhttp://www.example.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_example&format=feed\r\n Another common query value is task, which is used to determine the task the \r\n component will perform.  When we create our own components, it is advantageous to \r\n use them.  The reason behind this is that these components are partially implemented \r\n in the framework that we will be using.  In this example, we request the component \r\n example and invoke the task view:\r\nhttp://www.example.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_example&task=view\r\n\r\n Directory Structure\r\n Developing for Joomla!  requires an understanding of the overall directory structure. \r\n\r\n Libraries\r\n Joomla!  includes a selection of useful libraries, including its own library — joomla. \r\n To import a library we use the jimport() function.  In this example we import the \r\n joomla.filesystem.file  library, which is speciacally for handling ales:\r\njimport('joomla.filesystem.file');\r\n When we import a library, we have the option of importing the entire library or \r\n just a small part of it.  The previous example imports the /libraries/joomla/\r\n filesystem/file. php ale.  If we want, we can import all of the ales in the alesystem \r\n directory.  To do this we need to use the asterisk wildcard:\r\njimport('joomla.filesystem. *');\r\n Joomla!  does not currently support library extensions.  Future \r\n developments might include the ability to upload custom libraries \r\n and to implement dependencies.\r\n The following table details the base libraries that are included in Joomla! :\r\nLibrary                 Description                  License\r\n archive             tar ale management class (www.phpconcept.net).

This example \r\n demonstrates how we import the GeSHi class from the geshi library:\r\njimport('geshi.geshi');\r\n\r\n\r\n A Quick Lesson in Classes\r\n Joomla!  is designed to run on both PHP 4 and PHP 5 environments.  This has an \r\n impact on how we build classes and use objects in Joomla! , both of which we will \r\n discuss throughout this section.  Joomla!  has opted to continue using the PHP 4 syntax \r\n for reasons of bbaacckkwwaarrdd ccoommppaattiibbiilliittyy; ;  mmaannyy wweebbbssseeerrrvvveeerrrsss aaarrreee ssstttiiillllll uuusssiiinnnggg PPPHHHPPP 444... AAAsss \r\n third-party developers, we should follow suit and always build our extensions to be \r\n PHP 4 and PHP 5 compatible despite the fact that it may restrict some things.\r\n There are some important things that we need to be aware of, before we start \r\n building and using classes.  We'll start by looking some naming conventions.\r\n Class names should start with an uppercase letter.\r\n All named elements should use the camelCase standard.\r\n Method names should start with a lowercase letter.\r\n Non-public elements should start with an underscore.\r\n As only PHP 5 and above support access modiaers, we use a special naming \r\n convention to indicate non-public elements.  Methods and properties that are  \r\n non-public are preaxed with an underscore.\r\n We often pass and return objects and arrays by reference.  Doing this means that \r\n multiple variables can 'point' to the same object or array.  Note that in PHP 5 objects \r\n are always passed by reference.  Methods, functions, and parameters that return and \r\n are passed by reference are preaxed with an ampersand.  When we use a method \r\n or function that returns a reference, we must use the &= assignment operator as the \r\n following example demonstrates:\r\nfunction &go()\r\n {\r\n $instance = new stdClass();\r\n return $instance;\r\n }\r\n $reference =& go();\r\n When we pass objects around we must bear in mind that PHP versions 5 and above \r\n handle objects differently.  In PHP 5, objects are automatically passed by reference \r\n (although technically not the same as references, the effects are essentially the same).\r\n\r\n\r\n Inheriting from JObject\r\n In Joomla!  we often come across the class JObject.  Many of the classes in Joomla! \r\n are subclasses of JObject.  This base class provides us with some useful common \r\n methods including standard accessors and modiaers and a common error  \r\n handling mechanism.\r\n To encourage PHP 5 methodology, JObject emulates the PHP 5 constructor allowing \r\n us to use the constructor method, __constructor(), in subclasses irrespective of the \r\n version of PHP is being used.\r\n When we use inheritance in our classes we should, as a rule, always call the \r\n constructor of the parent class.  This guarantees that any construction work required \r\n by a parent class is executed.\r\n /**\r\n * Some Class which extends JObject\r\n */\r\n class SomeClass extends JObject\r\n {\r\n /**\r\n * Object name\r\n * @var string\r\n */\r\n var $name;\r\n /**\r\n * PHP 5 style Constructor\r\n *\r\n * @access  protected\r\n * @param string name\r\n */\r\n function __construct($name)\r\n {\r\n $this->name = $name;\r\n parent::__construct();\r\n }\r\n }\r\n Nearly all Joomla!  objects and classes derive from the base class JObject. \r\n This class offers several useful methods that all derived classes can use.  The \r\n getPublicProperties() method returns an array of public property names from \r\n the object.  This is determined at run time and uses the object properties, not the  \r\n class properties.\r\n The get() and set() methods are used to get and set properties of the object.  If \r\n we use get() with a nonexistent property, the default value will be returned.  If we \r\n use set() with a nonexistent property, the property will be created.  Both of these \r\n methods can be used with private properties.\r\n We can keep track of errors that occur in an object using the getErrors(), \r\ngetError(), and setError() methods.  Errors are recorded in the _errors array \r\n property.  Errors can be strings or JException or Exception objects.  JException objects \r\n are created when we raise errors;  this is explained in detail in Chapter 11.\r\n A full description of the JObject class is available in the Appendix.\r\n Working with the Request\r\n Generally when we develop PHP scripts, we work extensively with the request \r\n hashes: $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_COOKIE, and $_REQUEST.  In Joomla! , instead of \r\n directly using these, we use the static JRequest class.  We use this because it allows \r\n us to process the input at the same time as retrieving it, this decreases the amount of \r\n code required and helps improve security.\r\n The request hashes $_GET, $_POST, $_FILES, $_COOKIE, and $_REQUEST are still \r\n available, and in cases where we are porting existing applications we need not \r\n change the use of these hashes. \r\n The two methods that we use the most are JRequest::setVar() and JRequest::\r\ngetVar().  As the names suggest, one accesses request-data and the other sets it.  In \r\n this example, we get the value of id;  if id is not set, we return a default value, 0 (the \r\n default value is optional).\r\n $id = JRequest::getVar('id', 0);\r\n The JRequest::setVar() method is used to set values in the request hashes.  In \r\n comparison to the JRequest::getVar() method, this method is used relatively \r\n infrequently.  It is most commonly used to set default values.  For example, we might \r\n want to set the default task in a component if it is not already selected:\r\nJRequest::setVar('task', 'someDefaultTask');\r\n A useful trick to guarantee that a variable is set is to use the two methods in \r\n conjunction.  In this example, if name is not set, we set it to the default value  \r\n of 'unknown'.\r\n JRequest::setVar('name', JRequest::getVar('name', 'unknown'));\r\n Some other handy methods in JRequest are getInt(), getFloat(), getBool(), \r\ngetWord(), getCmd(), and getString().  If we use these methods, we guarantee \r\n that the returned value is of a speciac type.\r\n It is important to familiarize yourself with the JRequest methods \r\n described above because they are used extensively in Joomla! .  In \r\n addition, we will use them repeatedly in the code examples presented \r\n throughout this book.\r\n There is far more we can achieve using these methods, including preprocessing of \r\n data.  A more complete explanation is available in Chapter 11."

        "text":"What Comes Next\r\n The book is divided into five parts.  Part 1 presents the basic elements of a\r\n two-systems approach to judgment and choice.  It elaborates the distinction\r\n between the automatic operations of System 1 and the controlled\r\n operations of System 2, and shows how associative memory, the core of\r\n System 1, continually constructs a coherent interpretation of what is going\r\n on in our world at any instant.  I attempt to give a sense of the complexity\r\n and richness of the automatic and often unconscious processes that\r\n underlie intuitive thinking, and of how these automatic processes explain\r\n the heuristics of judgment.  A goal is to introduce a language for thinking\r\n and talking about the mind.\r\n Part 2 updates the study of judgment heuristics and explores a major\r\n puzzle: Why is it so difficult for us to think statistically?  We easily think\r\n associativelm 1associay, we think metaphorically, we think causally, but\r\n statistics requires thinking about many things at once, which is something\r\n that System 1 is not designed to do.\r\n The difficulties of statistical thinking contribute to the main theme of Part\r\n 3, which describes a puzzling limitation of our mind: our excessive\r\n confidence in what we believe we know, and our apparent inability to\r\n acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the\r\n world we live in.  We are prone to overestimate how much we understand\r\n about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.\r\n Overconfidence is fed by the illusory certainty of hindsight.  My views on this\r\n topic have been influenced by Nassim Taleb, the author of The Black\r\n Swan.  I hope for watercooler conversations that intelligently explore the\r\n lessons that can be learned from the past while resisting the lure of\r\n hindsight and the illusion of certainty.\r\n The focus of part 4 is a conversation with the discipline of economics on\r\n the nature of decision making and on the assumption that economic\r\n agents are rational.  This section of the book provides a current view,\r\ninformed by the two-system model, of the key concepts of prospect theory,\r\nthe model of choice that Amos and I published in 1979.  Subsequent\r\n chapters address several ways human choices deviate from the rules of\r\n rationality.  I deal with the unfortunate tendency to treat problems in\r\n isolation, and with framing effects, where decisions are shaped by\r\n inconsequential features of choice problems.  These observations, which\r\n are readily explained by the features of System 1, present a deep\r\n challenge to the rationality assumption favored in standard economics.\r\n Part 5 describes recent research that has introduced a distinction\r\n between two selves, the experiencing self and the remembering self, which\r\n do not have the same interests.  For example, we can expose people to\r\n two painful experiences.  One of these experiences is strictly worse than\r\n the other, because it is longer.  But the automatic formation of memories — \r\n a feature of System 1 — has its rules, which we can exploit so that the\r\n worse episode leaves a better memory.  When people later choose which\r\n episode to repeat, they are, naturally, guided by their remembering self\r\n and expose themselves (their experiencing self) to unnecessary pain.  The\r\n distinction between two selves is applied to the measurement of wellbeing,\r\nwhere we find again that what makes the experiencing self happy is\r\n not quite the same as what satisfies the remembering self.  How two selves\r\n"

        "text":"The bursar read it over and agreed that that seemed to be the case.\r\n It’s too bad my tuition was always so low, I mused aloud.  Never more than ten talents.  It was a bit of a missed opportunity for the University.  The Maer was richer than the King of Vint, after all.  And he would pay any tuition. . . .\r\n Riem was a savvy man, and he understood what I was hinting at immediately.  There followed a brief bout of negotiation, after which we shook hands and I saw him smile for the first time.\r\n I grabbed a bite of lunch, then waited in line with the rest of the students who didn’t have admissions tiles.  Most of them were new students, but a few were applying for readmission like myself.  It was a long line, and everyone was visibly nervous to some degree.  I whistled to pass the time and bought a meat pie and a mug of hot cider from a man with a cart.\r\n I caused a bit of a stir when I stepped into the circle of light in front of the masters’ table.  They had heard the news and were surprised to see me alive, most of them pleasantly so.  Kilvin demanded I report to the workshop soon, while Mandrag, Dal, and Arwyl argued over which courses of study I would pursue.  Elodin merely waved at me, the only one apparently unimpressed by my miraculous return from the dead.\r\n After a minute of congenial chaos, the Chancellor got things back under control and started my interview.  I answered Dal’s questions easily enough, and Kilvin’s.  But I fumbled my cipher with Brandeur, then had to admit I simply didn’t know the answer to Mandrag’s question about sublimation.\r\n Elodin shrugged away his opportunity to question me, yawning hugely.  Lorren asked a surprisingly easy question about the Mender heresies, and I managed a quick and clever answer for him.  I had to think for a long moment before answering Arwyl’s question about lacillium.\r\n That left only Hemme, who had been scowling furiously since I’d first stepped up to the masters’ table.  My lackluster performance and slow answers had brought a smug curve to his lips by this point.  His eyes gleamed whenever I gave a wrong answer.\r\n “Well well,” he said, shuffling through the sheaf of papers in front of him.  “I didn’t think we’d have to deal with your type of trouble again.”  He gave me an insincere smile.  “I’d heard you were dead.”\r\n “I heard you wear a red lace corset,” I said matter-of-factly.  “But I don’t believe every bit of nonsense that gets rumored about.”\r\n Some shouting followed, and I was quickly brought up on charges of Improper Address of a Master.  I was sentenced to compose a letter of apology and fined a single silver talent.  Money well spent.\r\n It was bad behavior though, and poorly timed, especially after my otherwise lackluster performance.  As a result, I was assigned a tuition of twenty-four talents.  Needless to say, I was terribly embarrassed.\r\n Afterward I returned to the bursar’s office.  I officially presented Alveron’s letter of credit to Riem and unofficially collected my agreed-upon cut: half of everything over ten talents.  I put the seven talents in my purse and wondered idly if anyone had ever been paid so well for insolence and ignorance.\r\n I headed to Anker’s, where I was pleased to discover no one had informed the owner of my death.  The key to my room was somewhere at the bottom of the Centhe Sea, but Anker had a spare.  I went upstairs and felt myself relax at the familiar sight of the sloping ceiling and narrow bed.  Everything was covered in a thin layer of dust.\r\n You might think my tiny room with its sloped ceiling and narrow bed would feel cramped after my grand suite in Alveron’s estate.  But nothing could be further from the truth.  I busied myself unpacking my travelsack and getting cobwebs out of corners.\r\n After an hour, I’d managed to pick the lock on the trunk at the foot of my bed and unpack the things I’d stored away.  I rediscovered my half-dismantled harmony clock and tinkered with it idly, trying to remember whether I’d been in the middle of taking it apart or putting it back together.\r\n Then, since I had no other pressing engagements, I made my way back across the river.  I stopped at the Eolian, where Deoch greeted me with an enthusiastic bear hug that lifted me from the ground.  After so long on the road, so much time spent among strangers and enemies, I’d forgotten what it was like to be surrounded by the warmth of friendly faces.  Deoch, Stanchion, and I shared drinks and traded stories until it started to get dark outside, and I left them to tend to their business.\r\n I prowled the city for a while, going to a few familiar boarding houses and taverns.  Two or three public gardens.  A bench beneath a tree in a courtyard.  Deoch told me he hadn’t so much as glimpsed Denna’s shadow in a year.  But even looking for her and not finding her was comforting in a way.  In some ways that seemed to be the heart of our relationship.\r\n\r\n Later that night I climbed onto Mains and made my way through the familiar maze of chimneys and mismatched slate and clay and tin.  I came around a corner and saw Auri sitting on a chimney, her long, fine hair floating around her head as if she were underwater.  She was staring up at the moon and swinging her bare feet.\r\n I cleared my throat softly, and Auri turned to look.  She hopped off the chimney and came scampering across the roof, pulling up a few steps short of me.  Her grin was brighter than the moon.  “There is a whole family of hedgehogs living in Cricklet!”  she said excitedly.\r\n Auri took two more steps and grabbed my hand with both of hers.  “There are babies tiny as acorns!”  She tugged at me gently.  “Will you come see?”\r\n I nodded, and Auri led me across the roof to the apple tree we could use to climb down into the courtyard.  When we finally got there, she looked at the tree, then down to where she still held my long, tan hand with both of her tiny white ones.  Her grip wasn’t tight, but it was firm, and she didn’t give any sign of letting go.\r\n “I missed you,” she said softly without looking up.  “Don’t go away again.”\r\n “I don’t ever plan on leaving,” I said gently.  “I have too much to do here.”\r\n Auri tilted her head sideways to peek up at me through the cloud of her hair.  “Like visit me?”\r\n “Like visit you,” I agreed.\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FORTY-THREE Bloodless\r\n There was one final surprise waiting for me on my return to the University.\r\n I’d been back for a handful of days before I returned to my work in the Fishery.  While I was no longer in desperate need of money, I missed the work.  There is something deeply satisfying in shaping something with your hands.  Proper artificing is like a song made solid.  It is an act of creation.\r\n So I went to Stocks, thinking to start with something simple, as I was out of practice.  As I approached the window, I saw a familiar face.  “Hello Basil,” I said.  “What did you do to get stuck here this time?”\r\n He looked down.  “Improper handling of reagents,” he muttered.\r\n I laughed.  “That’s not so bad.  You’ll be out in a span or so.”\r\n “Yeah.”  He looked up and gave a shamefaced grin.  “I heard you were back.  You come for your credit?”\r\n I stopped halfway through my mental list of everything I’d need to make a heat funnel.  “I beg your pardon?”\r\n Basil cocked his head to the side.  “Your credit,” he repeated.  “For the Bloodless.”  He looked at me for a moment, then realization dawned on his face.  “That’s right, you wouldn’t know. . .  .”  He stepped away from the window for a moment, and returned with something that looked like an eightsided lamp made entirely of iron.\r\n It was different than the arrowcatch I’d made.  The one I’d constructed was built from scratch and rather rough around the edges.  This one was smooth and sleek.  All the pieces fit together snugly, and it was covered in a thin layer of clear alchemical enamel that would protect it from rain and rust.  Clever, I should have included that in my original design.\r\n While part of me was flattered that someone had liked my design enough to copy it, a larger part of me was irritated to see an arrowcatch so much more polished than my original.  I noticed a telltale uniformity in the pieces.  “Someone made a set of moldings?”  I asked.\r\n Basil nodded.  “Oh yes.  Ages ago.  Two sets.”  He smiled.  “I’ve got to say, it’s clever stuff.  Took me a long while to get my head around how the inertial trigger worked, but now that I’ve got it. .  .”  He tapped his forehead.  “I’ve made two myself.  Good money for the time they take.  Beats the hell out of deck lamps.”\r\n That wrung a smile out of me.  “Anything is better than deck lamps,” I agreed, picking it up.  “Is this one of yours?”\r\n He shook his head.  “Mine sold a month back.  They don’t sit long.  Clever of you to price them so low.”\r\n I turned it over in my hands and saw a word grooved into the metal.  The blocky letters went deep into the iron, so I knew they were part of the mold.  They read, “Bloodless.”\r\n I looked up at Basil.  He smiled.  “You took off without giving it a proper name,” he said.  “Then Kilvin formalized the schema and added it to the records.  We needed to call it something before we started to sell it.”  His smile faded a bit.  “But that was around the same time word came back you’d been lost at sea.  So Kilvin brought in Master Elodin. . .  .”\r\n “To give it a proper name,” I said, still turning it in my hands.  “Of course.”\r\n “Kilvin grumbled a bit,” Basil said.  “Called it dramatic nonsense.  But it stuck.”  He shrugged and ducked down and rummaged a bit before bringing up a book.  “Anyway, you want your credit?”  He started flipping pages.  “You’ve got to have a chunk of it built up by now.  Lot of folk have been making them.”\r\n He found the page he wanted and ran his finger along the ledger line.  “There we are.  Sold twenty-eight so far . .  .”\r\n “Basil,” I said.  “I really don’t understand what you’re talking about.  Kilvin already paid me for the first one I made.”\r\n Basil furrowed his brow.  “Your commission,” he said matter-of-factly.  Then, seeing my blank look, he continued.  “Every time Stocks sells something, the Fishery gets a thirty percent commission and whoever owns the schema gets ten percent.”\r\n “I thought Stocks kept the whole forty,” I said, shocked.\r\n He lifted one shoulder in a shrug.  “Most times it does.  Stocks owns most of the old schemas.  Most things have already been invented.  But for something new . .  .”\r\n"

I never graduated from college.  Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.  Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.  That's it.  No big deal.  Just three stories.\r\n\r\n The first story is about connecting the dots.\r\n\r\n I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.  So why did I drop out?\r\n\r\n It started before I was born.  My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.  She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.  Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.  So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: \"We have an unexpected baby boy;  do you want him?\"  They said: \"Of course.\"  My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.  She refused to sign the final adoption papers.  She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.\r\n\r\n And 17 years later I did go to college.  But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.  After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.  I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.  And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.  So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.  It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.  The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.\r\n\r\n It wasn't all romantic.  I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.  I loved it.  And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.  Let me give you one example:\r\n\r\nReed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.  Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.  Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.  I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.  It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.\r\n\r\n None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.  But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.  And we designed it all into the Mac.  It was the first computer with beautiful typography.  If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.  If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.  Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.  But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.\r\n\r\n Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward;  you can only connect them looking backwards.  So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.  You have to trust in something  —  your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.  This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.\r\n\r\n My second story is about love and loss.\r\n\r\n I was lucky  —  I found what I loved to do early in life.  Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.  We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.  We had just released our finest creation  —  the Macintosh  —  a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.  And then I got fired.  How can you get fired from a company you started?  Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.  But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.  When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.  So at 30 I was out.  And very publicly out.  What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.\r\n\r\n I really didn't know what to do for a few months.  I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.  I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.  I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.  But something slowly began to dawn on me  —  I still loved what I did.  The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.  I had been rejected, but I was still in love.  And so I decided to start over.\r\n\r\n I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.  The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.  It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.\r\n\r\n During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.  Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.  In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.  And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.\r\n\r\n I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.  It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.  Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  Don't lose faith.  I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  You've got to find what you love.  And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.  Don't settle.  As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.  And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.  So keep looking until you find it.  Don't settle.\r\n\r\n My third story is about death.\r\n\r\n When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.\"  It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\"  And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.\r\n\r\n Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  Because almost everything  —  all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.  Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.  There is no reason not to follow your heart.\r\n\r\n About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.  I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.  I didn't even know what a pancreas was.  The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.  My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.  It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.  It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.  It means to say your goodbyes.\r\n\r\n I lived with that diagnosis all day.  Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.  I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.  I had the surgery and I'm fine now.\r\n\r\n This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.  Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:\r\n\r\nNo one wants to die.  Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.  And yet death is the destination we all share.  No one has ever escaped it.  And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.  It is Life's change agent.  It clears out the old to make way for the new.  Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.  Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.\r\n\r\n Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.  Don't be trapped by dogma  —  which is living with the results of other people's thinking.  Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.  And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you truly want to become.  Everything else is secondary.\r\n\r\n When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.  It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.  This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.  It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.\r\n\r\n Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue.  It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.  On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.  Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish.\"  It was their farewell message as they signed off.  Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish.  And I have always wished that for myself.  And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.\r\n\r\n Stay Hungry.  Stay Foolish.\r\n\r\n Thank you all very much."

        "text":"It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window.  The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it.  Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, 'Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!'  And so the little girl really did grow up;  her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony;  and she was called Snowdrop.\r\n But this queen died;  and the king soon married another wife, who became queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was.  She had a fairy looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon herself in it, and say:\r\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true! \r\n Of all the ladies in the land, \r\nWho is fairest, tell me, who?' \r\n And the glass had always answered:\r\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.' \r\n But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful;  and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.  Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual:\r\n'Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see, \r\nBut Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!' \r\n When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, 'Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.'  Then the servant led her away;  but his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he said, 'I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.'  So he left her by herself;  and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\r\n Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear;  and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm.  In the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further.  Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them;  and seven knives and forks laid in order;  and by the wall stood seven little beds.  As she was very hungry, she picked a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each glass;  and after that she thought she would lie down and rest.  So she tried all the little beds;  but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep.\r\n By and by in came the masters of the cottage.  Now they were seven little dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.  They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not right.  The first said, 'Who has been sitting on my stool?'  The second, 'Who has been eating off my plate?'  The third, 'Who has been picking my bread?'  The fourth, 'Who has been meddling with my spoon?'  The fifth, 'Who has been handling my fork?'  The sixth, 'Who has been cutting with my knife?'  The seventh, 'Who has been drinking my wine?'  Then the first looked round and said, 'Who has been lying on my bed?'  And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed.  But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come and see her;  and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, 'Good heavens!  what a lovely child she is!'  And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her;  and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.\r\n In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story;  and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her.  Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at home;  and they warned her, and said, 'The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.'\r\n But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she must be the handsomest lady in the land;  and she went to her glass and said:\r\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true! \r\n Of all the ladies in the land, \r\nWho is fairest, tell me, who?' \r\n And the glass answered:\r\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: \r\nBut over the hills, in the greenwood shade, \r\nWhere the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, \r\nThere Snowdrop is hiding her head;  and she \r\n Is lovelier far, O queen!  than thee.' \r\n Then the queen was very much frightened;  for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.  And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was;  so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt.  Then she knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!'  Snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, 'Good day, good woman!  what have you to sell?'  'Good wares, fine wares,' said she;  'laces and bobbins of all colours.' ' I will let the old lady in;  she seems to be a very good sort of body,' thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.  'Bless me!'  said the old woman, 'how badly your stays are laced!  Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.'  Snowdrop did not dream of any mischief;  so she stood before the old woman;  but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop's breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead.  'There's an end to all thy beauty,' said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\r\n In the evening the seven dwarfs came home;  and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the ground, as if she was quite dead.  However, they lifted her up, and when they found what ailed her, they cut the lace;  and in a little time she began to breathe, and very soon came to life again.  Then they said, 'The old woman was the queen herself;  take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.'\r\n When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before;  but to her great grief it still said:\r\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: \r\nBut over the hills, in the greenwood shade, \r\nWhere the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, \r\nThere Snowdrop is hiding her head;  and she \r\n Is lovelier far, O queen!  than thee.' \r\n Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived;  and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.  When she reached the dwarfs' cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, 'Fine wares to sell!'  But Snowdrop said, 'I dare not let anyone in.'  Then the queen said, 'Only look at my beautiful combs!'  and gave her the poisoned one.  And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it;  but the moment it touched her head, the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.  'There you may lie,' said the queen, and went her way.  But by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening;  and when they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb.  And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that had passed;  and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.\r\n Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before;  and she said, 'Snowdrop shall die, if it cost me my life.'  So she went by herself into her chamber, and got ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whoever tasted it was sure to die.  Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door;  but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, 'I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.'  'Do as you please,' said the old woman, 'but at any rate take this pretty apple;  I will give it you.'  'No,' said Snowdrop, 'I dare not take it.'  'You silly girl!'  answered the other, 'what are you afraid of?  Do you think it is poisoned?  Come!  do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.'  Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned.  Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice;  and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer.  But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground.  'This time nothing will save thee,' said the queen;  and she went home to her glass, and at last it said:\r\n'Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.' \r\n And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.\r\n When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead.  They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water;  but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead.  So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days;  and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy;  and her face looked just as it did while she was alive;  so they said, 'We will never bury her in the cold ground.'  And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name was, and that she was a king's daughter.  And the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched.  And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop;  and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\r\n And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she was asleep;  for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony.  At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house;  and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden letters.  Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away;  but they said, 'We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.'  At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin;  but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop awoke, and said, 'Where am I?'  And the prince said, 'Thou art quite safe with me.'\r\n Then he told her all that had happened, and said, 'I love you far better than all the world;  so come with me to my father's palace, and you shall be my wife.'  And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;  and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.\r\n To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop's old enemy the queen;  and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the glass and said:\r\n'Tell me, glass, tell me true! \r\n Of all the ladies in the land, \r\nWho is fairest, tell me, who?' \r\n And the glass answered:\r\n'Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween; \r\n But lovelier far is the new-made queen.' \r\n When she heard this she started with rage;  but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride.  And when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years;  and sometimes they went up into the mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind to Snowdrop in her time of need."

        "text":"CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX Tinder\r\n The sun was starting to set by the time we found a good place to camp on the second night.  Dedan went foraging for firewood.  Marten began cutting up carrots and potatoes and sent Hespe to fill the cookpot with water.  I used Marten’s small spade to dig a pit for our fire.\r\n Without being asked, Tempi picked up a branch and used his sword to shave thin strips of dry wood to use for tinder.  Unsheathed, his sword still didn’t seem terribly impressive.  But given how easily it was peeling away paper-thin strips of wood, it must have been sharp as a shaving razor.\r\n I finished lining the pit with stones.  Wordlessly, Tempi handed me a handful of tinder.\r\n I nodded.  “Would you like to use my knife?”  I asked, hoping to draw him into a bit of a conversation.  I’d barely shared a dozen words with him in the last two days.\r\n Tempi’s pale grey eyes looked at the knife on my belt, then back at his sword.  He shook his head, fidgeting nervously.\r\n “Isn’t it bad for the edge?”  I asked.\r\n The mercenary shrugged, avoiding my eye.\r\n I began to lay the fire, and that was when I made my first mistake.\r\n As I’ve said, there was a chill in the air, and we were all of us tired.  So rather than spend half an hour slowly nursing a spark into a decent campfire, I arranged twigs around Tempi’s tinder, then stacked progressively bigger sticks around it, making a tightly packed cluster of wood.\r\n Dedan returned with another armload of firewood just as I was finishing.  “Lovely,” he groused, quiet enough he could pretend he was just talking to himself, but loud enough so everyone could hear.  “And you’re in charge.  Wonderful.”\r\n “What’s stuck in your teeth now?”  Marten asked, tiredly.\r\n “Boy’s making a little wooden fort, not a fire.”  Dedan sighed dramatically, then assumed a tone he probably thought was fatherly, but came across as profoundly condescending.  “Here, I’ll help you out.  A spark will never catch on that.  Do you have flint and steel?  I’ll show you how to use them.”\r\n No one enjoys being talked down to, but I have a particular aversion to it.  Dedan had been making it clear for two days that he thought I was an idiot.\r\n I gave a tired sigh.  My oldest, most world-weary sigh.  That was how I needed to play it.  He thought of me as young and useless.  I needed to drive home the point that I was nothing of the sort.  “Dedan,” I asked, “what do you know about me?”\r\n He gave me a blank look.\r\n “You know one thing about me,” I said calmly.  “You know the Maer put me in charge.”  I looked him in the eye.  “Is the Maer an idiot?”\r\n Dedan made a dismissive gesture.  “Of course not, I was just sayin’. .  .”\r\n I stood up and regretted it, as it just brought into sharp contrast how much taller he was.  “Would the Maer have put me in charge if I were an idiot?”\r\n He gave an insincere smile, trying to pass off two days’ worth of derogatory muttering as some sort of misunderstanding.  “Now don’t get all twisted up over — ”\r\n I held up my hand.  “This isn’t your fault.  You just don’t know anything about me.  But let’s not waste time on it tonight.  We’re all tired.  For now, rest assured that I’m not some rich tit’s son, out for a lark.”\r\n I pinched a thin piece of Tempi’s tinder between my fingers and concentrated.  I pulled more heat than I needed and felt my arm go chilly all the way to the shoulder.  “And rest assured I know how to start a fire.”\r\n The shaved pieces of wood caught fire, flaring up hot and sudden, catching the rest of the tinder and making flames leap up almost instantly.\r\n I’d meant it to be a dramatic gesture so Dedan would stop thinking of me as some useless boy.  But the time I spent at the University had made me jaded.  Starting a fire like this was as simple as putting on your boots for a member of the Arcanum.\r\n Dedan, on the other hand, had never met an arcanist, and probably hadn’t ever been within five hundred miles of the University.  Everything he knew about magic was from campfire stories.\r\n So when the fire flared up, he went pale as a sheet and took several sudden steps back.  He looked for all the world as if I’d suddenly called up a roaring sheet of fire like Taborlin the Great.\r\n Then I saw Marten and Hespe wearing the same expression, native Vintish superstition written clearly on their faces.  Their eyes went to the flickering fire, then back to me.  I was one of those.  I meddled with dark powers.  I summoned demons.  I ate the entire little cheese, including the rind.\r\n Looking at their stunned faces, I realized nothing I said would set them at ease.  Not right now.  So instead I sighed and began to set up my sleeping roll for the night.\r\n While there wasn’t much cheerful conversation around the fire that night, there wasn’t any muttering from Dedan either.  I’d like respect, but failing that, a little healthy fear can go a long way to making things run smoothly.\r\n\r\n Two days with no further dramatics on my part helped everyone relax.  Dedan was still all bluff and bravado, but he had quit calling me “boy” and was only complaining about half as much, so I considered it a victory.\r\n Flushed with this lukewarm success, I decided to make an active attempt to draw Tempi into a conversation.  If I was going to be in charge of this little group, I needed to know more about him.  Most importantly, I needed to know if he could speak more than five words in a row.\r\n So I approached the Adem mercenary when we stopped for our midday meal.  He was sitting slightly apart from the rest of us.  He wasn’t standoffish.  It’s just that the rest of us would sit and talk while we ate.  Tempi, on the other hand, simply ate.\r\n But today I made a point of sitting down next to him with my lunch: a chunk of hard sausage and some cold potatoes.  “Hello, Tempi.”\r\n He looked up and nodded.  For a second I caught a glimpse of his pale grey eyes.  Then he looked away, shifting restlessly.  He ran his hand through his hair, and for a second he reminded me of Simmon.  They both had the same slender build and sandy hair.  Simmon wasn’t this quiet though.  Sometimes I could barely get a word in edgewise with Sim.\r\n I’d tried to talk to Tempi before, of course.  Ordinary small talk: the weather, sore feet after a long day’s walk, the food.  These had all come to nothing.  At best a word or two.  More often a nod or a shrug.  But most common was a blank look followed by fidgeting and a stubborn refusal to do so much as look me in the eye.\r\n So today I had a conversational gambit.  “I have heard stories about the Lethani,” I said.  “I would like to know more.  Would you tell me about it?”\r\n Tempi’s pale eyes touched mine briefly, his expression still blank.  Then he looked away again.  He tugged one of the red leather straps that held his shirt close to his body and fidgeted with his sleeve.  “No.  I will not speak on Lethani.  It is not for you.  Do not ask.”\r\n He looked away from me again, down at the ground.\r\n I counted in my head.  Sixteen words.  That answered one of my questions at least.\r\n CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN Pennysworth\r\n Twilight was settling in as we rounded a curve in the road.  I heard clapping and stomping mingled with music, shouting, and roars of laughter.  After ten hours of walking, the sound lifted my spirits to an almost cheerful level.\r\n Located at the last major crossroad south of the Eld, the Pennysworth Inn was enormous.  Built of rough-hewn timber, it had two full stories and a scattering of gables that hinted at a smaller, third floor above that.  Through the windows I caught glimpses of men and women dancing while an unseen fiddler sawed out a mad and breathless tune.\r\n Dedan took a deep breath.  “Can you smell that?  I tell you, there’s a woman in this place could cook a stone and make me beg for more.  Sweet Peg.  By these hands, I hope she’s still around.”  He made a curving gesture, showing the double meaning of his words as he nudged Marten with an elbow.\r\n Hespe’s eyes narrowed as she stared at the back of Dedan’s head.\r\n Oblivious, Dedan continued, “Tonight I’ll sleep with a bellyful of lamb and brandy.  Although a little less sleeping might prove a little more entertaining, if my last trip here was any indication.”\r\n I saw the storm brewing on Hespe’s face and spoke up quickly.  “Whatever’s in the pot and a bunk for each of us,” I said firmly.  “Anything else comes out of your own pocket.”\r\n Dedan looked as if he couldn’t quite believe his ears.  “Come off it.  We’ve been sleeping rough for days.  Besides, ’taint your money, don’t be a stingy shim with it.”\r\n “We haven’t done our job yet,” I said calmly.  “Not even a piece of it.  I don’t know how long we may be out here, but I know I’m not rich.  If we run through the Maer’s purse too quickly we’re going to have to hunt for what we eat.”  I looked around at everyone.  “Unless someone else has enough coin to keep us fed and cares to share?”\r\n Marten smiled ruefully at the suggestion.  Hespe’s eyes were for Dedan, who continued glowering in my direction.\r\n Tempi fidgeted, his expression unreadable as ever.  Avoiding my eyes, he glanced at everyone in turn, his expression blank.  His eyes moved, not from face to face, but at Dedan’s hands, then Dedan’s feet.  Then Marten’s feet, then Hespe’s, then mine.  He shifted his weight and moved a half-step closer to Dedan.\r\n Hoping to dispel the tension, I softened my tone and said, “After everything is done we’ll split what’s left of the purse.  That way each of us will have a little extra in our pocket before we even get back to Severen.  We can each spend our lots as we want to.  Then.”\r\n I could tell Dedan wasn’t pleased and waited to see if he would press the point.\r\n Instead it was Marten who spoke up.  “After a day of long walking,” he said in a musing voice, as if talking to himself.  “A drink would go down nice.”\r\n Dedan looked to his friend, then back to me expectantly.\r\n “I think the purse can stand a round of drinks,” I conceded with a smile.  “I don’t think the Maer is trying to make priests of us, do you?”\r\n This got a throaty laugh from Hespe, while Marten and Dedan cracked smiles.  Tempi glanced at me with his pale eyes, fidgeted, and looked away.\r\n\r\n A few minutes of relaxed haggling got the five of us common bunks, a simple supper, and a round of drinks for a single silver bit.  After that was done, I found a table in a quieter corner of the room and tucked my lute out of harm’s way under my bench.  Then I sat down, bone weary and wondering what I could do to get Dedan to stop acting like such a little swaggercock.\r\n Such was the distracted turning of my thoughts when my dinner thumped onto the table in front of me.  I looked up to see a woman’s face and well-advertised bosom framed by a tumble of bright red curls.  Her skin was white as cream with just the barest hint of freckle.  Her lips a pale, dangerous pink.  Her eyes a bright, dangerous green.\r\n “Thank you,” I said, somewhat belatedly.\r\n “You’re welcome, love.”  She smiled playfully with her eyes and brushed her hair back from her bare shoulder.  “It looked like you were almost a-sleeping in your seat.”\r\n “I nearly was.  A long day and a long road.”\r\n “That’s a shame indeed,” she said with playful regret as she rubbed the back of her neck.  “If I thought you’d still be on your feet in an hour, I’d take you off them.”  She reached out and twined her fingers lightly through the hair on the back of my head.  “The two of us would be enough to start a fire.”\r\n I froze like a startled deer.  I cannot say why, except perhaps that I was tired from several days on the road.  Perhaps it was that I’d never been approached in such a forthright manner before.  Perhaps — \r\n Perhaps I was young and woefully inexperienced.  Let us leave it at that.\r\n I scrambled desperately for something to say, but by the time I found my tongue she’d taken a half step away and given me a shrewd look.  I felt my face grow hot, embarrassing me further.  Without thinking, I looked down at the table and the dinner she’d brought.  Potato soup, I thought numbly.\r\n She gave a small, quiet laugh and touched my shoulder kindly.  “I’m sorry lad.  You looked like you were a little more — ” She broke off, as if reconsidering her words, then started again.  “I liked the fresh look of you, but I didn’t think you were that young.”\r\n Though she spoke gently, I could hear the smile in her voice.  It made my face burn even hotter, all the way to my ears.  Finally, seeming to realize that anything she said would just embarrass me further, she took her hand off my shoulder.  “I’ll be back to see if you need anything later.”\r\n I nodded dumbly and watched her go.  Her retreat was pleasing, but I was distracted by the sounds of scattered laughter.  I looked around to see amusement on the faces of the men sitting at the long tables around me.  One group raised their mugs in a silent, mocking salute.  Another fellow leaned over to pat my back consolingly, saying, “Don’t take it personal, boy, she’s turned all of us away.”\r\n Feeling as if everyone in the room was watching me, I kept my eyes low and began to eat my dinner.  As I tore off pieces of bread and dipped them in my soup, I composed a mental catalog of the extent of my idiocy.  Surreptitiously, I watched the red-haired serving girl entertain and rebuff the ploys of a dozen men as she carried drinks from table to table.\r\n I had regained a bit of my composure by the time Marten slid into a chair next to me.  “You did a good job with Dedan out there,” he said without preamble.\r\n My spirits lifted a bit.  “Did I?”\r\n Marten nodded slightly as his sharp eyes wandered over the crowd that filled the room.  “Most folk try to bully him, make him feel stupid.  He’d have paid you back ten times the trouble if you’d done it that way.”\r\n “He was being stupid,” I pointed out.  “And when you come right down to it, I did bully him.”\r\n It was his turn to shrug.

        "text":"Once upon a time there was a King and a Queen who had all the luxury as that money could buy.  But their most treasure possession of all was their beautiful baby daughter.  In fact they were so proud of her that they invited all the fairies in the kingdom to her christening.  It wasn’t every day that the fairies had a chance to get to such a grand occasion, so they made a most of it and made up the beautiful party dresses especially for it.\r\n The christening was such a happy and colourful occasion.  The little Princess slept quietly in her cradle and didn’t make a sound.\r\n “I’ve never seen such a beautiful little baby,” said the queen of the fairies.\r\n When the Queen and the King heard this, it made their hearts swell with pride.\r\n “Thank you all so much for coming here,” said the King and then he led them all to the great banqueting hall for a fabulous feast in honour of his little Princess.\r\n The fairies have just picked up their nice forks and they were about to start eating when they heard a terrible high pitched wailing sound coming from the end of the hall: “Stop!”\r\n They looked towards the grand staircase and saw an ugly old fairy storming down the stairs.  She had a long pointed nose and was wearing an enormous black satin cloak.\r\n “Stop!”  The old fairy looked straight at the Queen and said: “How can you have a party without inviting me?  I am the oldest and the wisest fairy in the land!”\r\n The poor Queen was rather frightened of her but didn’t know what to say.\r\n “Leave it to me,” the King whispered.\r\n “Oh, look!  I am terribly sorry with offended you but you are welcome to join in this celebrations,” he said in his kindest sweetest voice.\r\n “All right, I’ll stay if you insist, “ said the ugly fairy.  But she still was not happy.  “I’ll get my own back on my pair for forgetting to invite me!”  she muttered to herself.\r\n The wicked old fairy certainly took advantage of the King’s hospitality.  She powered up her plate that they could hardly see her face behind a tall mount of food on it.\r\n The banquet lasted a long time because all the guests had to wait for the old fairy to finish eating.  At last, when she did her final mouthful, everybody left the table and came up to stare gifts for the Princess.\r\n Great beauty, a kind heart and a wonderful singing voice  —  were just a few of the gifts given to the lovely Princess.  When it came the old fairy’s turn, she lent over the cradle and said: “You will prick your hand with a spindle and die of the wound.”\r\n All the other fairies gasped at these terrible words.  Then Christine, who was the youngest fairy, stepped forward:\r\n“I can’t change the awful spell but I can alter it.  You will indeed prick your finger but you will not die.  Instead, you will fall into a deep sleep that will last for a hundred years until a handsome prince awakens you. \r\n That night when all the guests had left, the King ordered that all the spinning wheels with the spindles in his Kingdom should be burnt.  So his servants went on collecting all the spindle wheels in the land and burnt on a big bomb firing in the palace garden.  All his subjects were sad to see spindle wheels going up in smoke but they didn’t complain.  They knew this had to be done for the sake of the little Princess.\r\n “I feel so much happier now when all the spindles left our kingdom,” said the King to his wife.\r\n “You are very wise to be so careful,” said the Queen.  “But what about our poor subjects?  Many of them rely on their spinning means to only living.”\r\n “Don’t worry!  I’ve given a bag of gold to everybody who had burnt his spinning wheel,” said the King.\r\n And these kind words made the Queen very happy. \r\n Many happy years passed.  And the Princess grew up to be all the King and the Queen had hoped for: beautiful, clever and very kind.  But one day the King and the Queen went on a royal tour and left the Princess to look after the palace.  She felt very lonely without her mother and father.  So she wandered around the palace looking for somebody to talk to.  The only person she could find was an old woman who lived at the top of the palace.\r\n The old woman was very glad to see her as she was feeling very lonely too.\r\n “Do come into, here!”  said the old woman.  “I’ve just baked a cake.  Please, take a slice and let me make you a cup of tea to go with it.”\r\n “That will be lonely!”  said the Princess.\r\n And when the old woman within the kitchen making the tea, the Princess noticed a spinning wheel in the corner of the room.\r\n “What a strange machine?”  asked the Princess.\r\n “It’s a spinning wheel,” said the old woman in reply.  “I’ll just put this thread down and now show you how it works.\r\n The old woman hadn’t heard about the King’s ban all these years ago and she didn’t think of making any harm in showing the Princess how to spin.  So the old woman sat down at the wheel and started spinning.  The Princess watched her with eager eyes.\r\n “I’d love to do it myself,” she said.\r\n But no sooner had she started spinning when she pricked her hand on a needle and fainted.\r\n “Help!  Help!  The Princess has fainted!”  cried the old woman.\r\n Servants came running from all corners of the palace.  One servant threw a bucket of water over her while another held a jag of smelling salt under her nose.  But nobody could make the Princess wake up.\r\n “Fetch the royal doctor!”  shouted the head servant.\r\n And one of the young servants ran to tell him about the sleeping Princess.  When the doctor arrived, he tried all sorts of things to wake her up.  He even put an ear trumpet to her ear and shouted into it.  But she still wouldn’t wake up.\r\n Later that day the Queen and the King came back from their royal tour.  They were very shocked when they found their beautiful daughter in the old woman’s room in such a deep sleep that she couldn’t wake up.\r\n “You are a stupid old woman,” cried the King.  “Didn’t you know that all spinning wheels were banned in my kingdom many years ago?  You deserved to go to prison for this.”\r\n The poor old woman couldn’t understand what she had done wrong.\r\n “I’ve lived alone and haven’t seen your servants for many years, Your Majesty.  And no one told me about a wicked spell,” was her reply.\r\n “Don’t be too hard to the old woman,” said the Queen.  “She is not to be blamed for our poor daughter’s fate.”\r\n “Yes, you are right,” said the King.  “It’s not her fault!  Come and let’s take our daughter down and make her as comfortable as we can.”\r\n The good fairy Christine who had been at the christening soon found out about the Princess and she rushed over to the King and Queen’s palace in a golden chariot.  She was a very clever fairy because she realized that if the Princess woke up in a hundred years time and found herself alone she would be very frightened.  So the fairy waved a magic wand and put all the servants in the palace, and the King and the Queen, to sleep as well.\r\n In just a few minutes a large number of thorny bushes and trees within intertwining branches grew up around the palace and it became impossible for anyone to get through.\r\n A hundred years have passed while the ingested castle slept.\r\n Then one day a handsome young Prince rode by.  He noticed the towers of the palace sticking out above the bushes and being a curious lad, he got off his horse and stabbed a better look.\r\n The young Prince saw a man riding by on a horse and shouted out to him:\r\n“Do you know who lives in these towers over there?”\r\n “You’ll find witches and ghosts living there,” replied the man and he rode off.\r\n The Prince didn’t take his answer very seriously, so he decided to ask a farmer who was walking by the same question.  The farmer told him:\r\n“Many years ago a beautiful young princess lived here with the King and Queen, and as it is said that she was put under the spell that would make her sleep for a hundred years.  I was told that she would only wake up when the most handsome prince in the land would kiss her.  When he heard this, the Prince was so fascinated by this story that he rushed straight over through to the tangle woods and tried to cut his way through with his sward as he thought.  But there was no need for him to do this because every time he moved forward, the trees made a pass to let him pass through.  When he entered the palace courtyard, he was amazed by what he saw.  All the servants were asleep, some had even fallen asleep standing up.\r\n The Prince called out: “Hello?  Anybody there?” \r\n But there was no reply.  All the palace was absolutely quiet except for the occasional sound of snoring.\r\n He walked past all the servants thinking he might wake them up, but none of them did.  He even tickled the couple of them but there was no response.\r\n Next he came up to the palace guard: they were all lying up in front of the grand staircase with muskets on their shoulders, but even they were fast asleep.  Even though the Prince was a little nervous if just walking past, so he went very close to the ear of the sergeant in charge and shouted as loud as he could: “Wake up!”  But the sergeant just snored a little louder.  So the Prince carried on up the marble staircase.  He kept on walking until he came to the grandest room in the palace.  In the middle of this room was a magnificent four-poster bed with all the curtains drone back.\r\n Lying on the bed was the most beautiful girl that the Prince had ever seen.  She was dressed in a magnificent gown, but like everyone else in the palace she was fast asleep.\r\n The Prince realized that this must be the Princess and she had been sleeping for a hundred years.\r\n “Hello,” he whispered.  “I am the Prince who has come to break your spell.” \r\n And he kneeled the bed and kissed the Princess very gently.  This was the very\r\n moment at which the wicked fairy spell was broken, and the Princess awoke.  As she saw the Prince nearly at her bedside, she looked straight into his deep blue eyes and said:\r\n“I’ve waited for a long time for you, my Prince.”\r\n The Prince was charmed by these words and he quickly told the Princess that he had loved her as soon as he first saw her.  At the very same moment as the Princess had been woken up, everyone else in the palace had also been woken up from a deep sleep: the King and the Queen, all the servants, the palace guard and courtiers started busily about their business.  They were all delighted because they saw their beautiful young Princess had woken from her hundred years’ sleep.  And it was clear that she was very happy with the handsome Prince.  But those of them who were not in love were very hungry indeed.\r\n So a huge celebration banquet was prepared, and they all sat down in the grand hall to a hearty meal including the happy young Prince and Princess.\r\n While they were eating this grand meal, all the thorny bushes and trees with intertwining branches that had surrounded the palace for a hundred years disappeared.\r\n The Prince took the beautiful Princess home to his palace and introduced her to his parents, the king and the queen.  They were very happy that the two were deeply in love.  And the very next day the handsome Prince and the beautiful Princess were married at a grand ceremony.  After the wedding ceremony everybody waved good-bye to the Prince and Princess as they set off to the far away land for their honeymoon."

        "text":"Once upon a time there was a little boy called Leo who lived in a big farmhouse with his mother and father.  His mother spent all her days baking, and people would come far and wide to buy her delicious bread and cakes.\r\n One morning Leo’s mother made a very special cake.  It was called a Johnny-Cake, and she put it into the oven to bake.\r\n “Now you be a good boy and watch the cake while we work in the garden,” said Leo’s mother.\r\n Leo did what as he was told and sat patiently by the oven.  So Leo’s mother and father went out into the garden.  His father hauled the potatoes and his mother picked them up and put them into a huge basket.  They sang as they worked because they were happy people.  And they were looking forward to eating a delicious cake that was being baked for them also.\r\n But while his father and mother were working, Leo didn’t watch the cake all the time.  In fact, he forgot about the cake for a few minutes and started playing with his pet dog.\r\n “You boy, come here, come here!”\r\n Then all of a sudden he heard a noise.  Little Leo’s bumped round his chair and saw that the outer door was open and Johnny-Cake had jumped out.\r\n “Come back, Johnny-Cake!”  shouted Leo.\r\n But in a flash Johnny-Cake had rolled right across the kitchen floor and then quickly made his way towards the front door and out of the house.  Leo sped to the front door as fast as he could and tried to close it before the Cake could escape, but he wasn't’ quick enough.  Johnny-Cake had already rolled out of the door and down the path.  Leo raced after him with his little pet-dog following behind.\r\n “Come back, you, Cake!”\r\n As he was running, he noticed his mother and father in the garden and shouted out to them: “Johnny-Cake has escaped from the oven!”  Stop him, somebody!”\r\n And when his father and mother saw what was happening, they left the work and joined the chase.  So the great cake chase whizzed on.\r\n “Come back, Johnny-Cake!”  they all cried.\r\n But Johnny-Cake wasn’t let them catch him.  He didn’t want to end up in little slices on the plate.\r\n “If you don’t stop rolling, we won’t have anything to eat for our tea!”  Leo’s father shouted to the Cake.\r\n But, of course, these words made Johnny-Cake roll faster than ever.  And then Mr Cake felt so sure that they wouldn’t catch him that he chuckled as he rolled: “Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n “Stop that cake!”\r\n Past all the houses in the village, they ran but Johnny-Cake rolled too fast for all of them and it soon rolled so far that he was out of sight.\r\n “Let’s stop and catch our breath!”  said Leo’s father.\r\n The all three agreed that they could run no more.  So they gave up the chase and sat down on a village green to rest for a while.\r\n “Oh, I can’t go further!\r\n “Oh, I am too.  I am completely out of breath!”\r\n “Oh, what a funny cake!”\r\n And still Johnny-Cake kept rolling.  Soon he came upon two men who were digging a well.  And when they saw him, one of them said:\r\n“Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?”\r\n “I am not going anywhere in particular.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”  said Johnny-Cake.  “But I am a match for any man who wants to chase me.  I’ve already outran an old man, an old woman and a little boy…” he cried out chickly to the men.  “Come on!  Catch me if you can!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n “Do you think if a dough little cake can outrun us?”  said one of the diggers.\r\n And they both threw down their picks and gave chase.\r\n “Come on!  Come on!  Chase me!”\r\n And the chuckling Cake rolled on the tremendous space.  And after the two well diggers ran about a mile they were both completely out of breath and had to stop at the nearest inn for a jug of ale.\r\n “It’s impossible … well, well, well.  This is a thirsty work.”\r\n On rolled Johnny-Cake, and soon came across two men who were digging a ditch.\r\n “Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?”  said the man.\r\n “I might be going to the end of the earth,” said Johnny-Cake.  “But if you want to find out you can catch me first.  I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy and two well diggers.  Come on!  Catch me of you can!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n So the ditch diggers took up Johnny-Cake’s invitation, put down their spades and gave chase.  But Johnny-Cake soon rolled out far into the distance, and they ran so fast and were so exhausted that they knew that they would never catch up with him.  So pushing and panting they sat down on the nearest tree stump and had a rest.\r\n “Not to catch this one.  It’s too fast for me!”\r\n But Johnny-Cake didn’t need a rest.  On and on he rolled.  He felt that he could roll forever.\r\n “Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n Soon he rolled into the forest and there he met a bear.  The bear was surprised to see a cake travelling at some speed and he called out to him: “Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?”\r\n “I may be travelling to the moon.  But if you want to find out, you’ll have to catch me first.  I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, and two ditch diggers and… I can outrun you, too!  Come on!  Catch me if you can!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”  was Johnny-Cake’s reply.\r\n “You are no match for a bear like me!”  said the bear.\r\n So the bear started running after Johnny-Cake.  But it was a big bear, and he was so fat that he could hardly run, and Johnny-Cake was so far ahead that the bear might just as well of giving up as the men. \r\n The bear wouldn’t give up chasing him because his idea of tasty cake for his tea was too much to resist, so he kept on running.  But Johnny-Cake rolled on such a pace that the bear was soon lagging far behind.\r\n “Oh, no one bear can go more enough!  Poor idea!”\r\n Johnny-Cake kept on to him: “Come on!  You can catch me!”  he said.  “Just run a bit faster!”\r\n But the poor bear was too exhausted to even reply.  The bear ran as far as he possibly could but eventually he had to give up the chase.  So he stretched himself out and went to sleep on the roadside.  He couldn’t run any more.  Johnny-Cake had bitten him.\r\n But Johnny-Cake certainly wasn’t bitten yet.  He rolled through the woods still keeping up the same fast pace which he had when the chase had begun.\r\n Eventually Johnny-Cake came across a fierce-looking wolf.\r\n “Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?”  said the wolf.\r\n “I could be going to the sun,” said Johnny-Cake.  “But if you really want to find out, you’ll have to catch me first!  I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers and a bear.  And I can outrun you, too!  Come on!  Catch me if you can!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n “You think you can outrun me?  You, honestly think a wolf like me won’t be able to catch you?”  said the wolf.  “Well, we’ll soon see about that!”\r\n So the hungry wolf chased after Johnny-Cake who kept rolling so fast that the wolf with his half of hearts knew that he would never overtake him.  In the end the wolf gave up and laid down on the roadside for the rest.\r\n “So, who cares?  I wasn’t hungry at all.”\r\n And still Johnny-Cake got on rolling.  Soon he came across a sneaky-looking fox who was sitting by a fence.  The fox cried out: “Where are you going, Johnny-Cake?”\r\n This was Johnny-Cake’s reply: “My own business.  If you want to find it out you’ll have to catch me first.  I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I can outrun you, too!  Come on!  Catch me if you can!”\r\n The fox was the crafty old fox and he looked at Johnny-Cake and said: I am a little deaf, Johnny-Cake and can’t quite hear you.  Come a little closer and repeat what you’ve just said.”\r\n At last Johnny-Cake stopped rolling and he went a little closer to the fox and shouted out at the top of his voice: \r\n“I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf!  I can outrun you, too!  Come on!  Catch me if you can!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!”\r\n After although the crafty fox had heard Johnny-Cake’s tones perfectly well, he pretended that he hadn’t.\r\n “I still can’t quite hear you,” said the fox to the Cake.  “Can you come just a little closer?”\r\n Johnny-Cake rolled closer and looking straight at the fox he screamed:\r\n“I’ve outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf!  I can outrun you, too!  Come on!  Catch me if you can!”\r\n Just as Johnny-Cake had finished shouting out this, the fox snapped up the Cake in his sharp teeth.  And that was the end of Johnny-Cake."

He had hardly moved in when the wolf came walking by and seeing the new house knocked on the door.  \"Little pig, little pig\" he said \"Open up the door and let me in.\"  Now the little pig's mother had warned him about strangers so he said \"No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in.\"  \"Now I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.\"  Cried the wolf. \r\n But the little pig went on saying \"No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in.\"  So the old wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down and the little pig run fast as he could back to his mother's house.\r\n The second little pig said goodbye to his mother and set out.  Before long he met a man with the bundle of sticks.  \"Please man\" he said, \"Will you let me have that bundle of sticks to build my house.\"  \"Yes, you can have it, here it is.\"  Said the kind man. \r\n So the second little pig was very pleased and used the sticks to build himself the house.  He had hardly moved in when the wolf came walking by and knocked at the door.  \"Little pig, little pig\" he said \"Open up your door and let me in.\"  Now the second little pig remembered what his mother had told him so he too said \"No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in.\"  \"Now I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.\"  Cried the wolf.  But the little pig went on saying \"No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in.\" \r\n So again the old wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed this time it was much harder work but finally down came the house and the second little pig had to run as fast as he could back to his mother's house.\r\n Then last of all the third little pig set out and met a man with load of bricks.  \"Please man\" he said, \"Will you let me have that load of bricks to build my house.\"  \"Yes, here they are, all for you.\"  Said the kind man. \r\n The third little pig was very pleased and built himself the brick house.  Again the wolf came along and again he said.  \"Little pig, little pig open your door and let me in.\"  But like his brothers the third little pig said \"No, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin, I'll not let you in.\"  \"Now I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.\"  Cried the wolf. \r\n And when the third little pig wouldn't open the door he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed then he tried again but the brick house was so strong that he could not blow it down. \r\n This made the wolf so angry that he jumped onto the roof of the little brick house and roared down the chimney.  \"I'm coming down to eat you up.\"  The little pig had put a pot of boiling water on the fire and now he took off the lid, down the chimney tumbled the wolf and splash, he fell right into the pot. \r\n Quickly the little pig bang down the cover and boiled up the old wolf for his dinner.  And so, the clever little pig lived happily ever after."

        "text":" Hespe tapped Dedan on the chest with the back of her hand, her knuckles making a hollow noise on his hard leather vest.\r\n “Do you think you could convince them you were disgruntled caravan guards who had decided to turn bandit?”\r\n Dedan snorted.  “Hell, I’ve thought about it once or twice.”  At a look from Hespe he snorted.  “Don’t tell me you haven’t done the same.  Span after span of walking in the rain, eating beans, sleeping on the ground.  All for penny a day?”  He shrugged.  “God’s teeth.  I’m surprised half of us don’t take to the trees.”\r\n I smiled.  “You’ll do just fine.”\r\n “What about him?”  Hespe jerked her thumb at Tempi.  “Nobody is going to believe he’s gone wild.  Adem make ten times what we do for a day’s work.”\r\n “Twenty times,” Dedan grumbled.\r\n I’d been thinking the same thing.  “Tempi, what will you do if you are found by the bandits?”\r\n Tempi fidgeted a little, but didn’t say anything.  He looked at me briefly, then broke eye contact, glancing down and to the side.  I couldn’t tell if he was thinking, or merely confused.\r\n “If it weren’t for his Adem reds, he wouldn’t look like anything special,” Marten said.  “Even the sword doesn’t look like much.”\r\n “Doesn’t look like twenty times as much as me, that’s for sure,” Dedan’s voice was low, but not so low that everyone couldn’t hear.\r\n I was worried about Tempi’s outfit too.  I’d tried to draw the Adem into a conversation several times with the hope of discussing the problem with him, but it was like trying to have a chat with a cat.\r\n But the fact that he hadn’t known the word “miles” made me realize something I should have thought of long before.  Aturan wasn’t his native language.  Having recently struggled to make myself fluent in Siaru at the University, I could understand the impulse to keep quiet rather than speak and make a fool of myself.\r\n “He could try to play along, same as us,” Hespe said dubiously.\r\n “It’s hard to lie convincingly when you’re not good with the language,” I said.\r\n Tempi’s pale eyes darted to each of us as we spoke, but he didn’t offer any comment.\r\n “Folk underestimate a person who can’t speak well,” Hespe said.  “Maybe he could sort of just . . .  play dumb?  Act confused like he was lost?”\r\n “Wouldn’t have to play dumb,” Dedan continued under his breath.  “Could just be dumb.”\r\n Tempi looked at Dedan, still expressionless, but with more intensity than before.  He drew a slow, deliberate breath before speaking.  “Quiet is not stupid,” he said, his voice flat.  “You?  Always talk.  Chek chek chek chek chek.”  He made a motion with one hand, like a mouth opening and closing.  “Always.  Like dog all night barking at tree.  Try to be big.  No.  Just noise.  Just dog.”\r\n I shouldn’t have laughed, but it caught me completely off guard.  Partly because I thought of Tempi as so quiet and passive, and partly because he was absolutely right.  If Dedan were a dog, he would be a dog that barked endlessly at nothing.  Barking just to hear himself bark.\r\n Still, I shouldn’t have laughed.  But I did.  Hespe laughed too and tried to hide it, which was worse.\r\n Dedan’s face went dark with anger and he got to his feet.  “You come here and say that.”\r\n Still expressionless, Tempi stood and walked around the fire until he stood next to Dedan.  Well . . .  if I say he stood next to him, you will take the wrong impression.  Most people stand two or three feet away when talking to you.  But Tempi walked until he was less than a foot away from Dedan.  To get any closer, he would have had to give him a hug or climb him.\r\n I could lie and say this happened too quickly for me to intervene, but that wouldn’t be true.  The simple truth was that I couldn’t think of an easy way to break up the situation.  But the more complicated truth was that I was pretty fed up with Dedan myself by this point.\r\n What’s more, this was the most I’d ever heard Tempi speak.  For the first time since I’d met him, he was behaving like a person, not just some mute, ambulatory doll.\r\n And I was curious to see him fight.  I’d heard a lot about the legendary Adem prowess, and I was hoping to see it thump some of the sullen mutter out of Dedan’s thick head.\r\n Tempi walked up to Dedan, standing close enough to put his arms around him.  Dedan stood a full head taller, broader across the shoulders, and thicker in the chest.  Tempi looked up at him without a trace of anything you might expect to see on his face.  No bravado.  No mocking smile.  Nothing.\r\n “Just dog,” Tempi said softly, with no particular inflection.  “Big noise dog.”  He lifted up his hand and made a mouth of it again.  “Chek.  Chek.  Chek.”\r\n Dedan lifted a hand and shoved hard against Tempi’s chest.  I’d seen this sort of thing countless times in the taverns near the University.  It was the sort of shove that sends a man staggering backward, off balance and prone to stagger and trip.\r\n Except Tempi didn’t stagger.  He just . . .  stepped away.  Then he reached out casually and cuffed Dedan along one side of his head, the way a parent might swat an unruly child in the market.  It wasn’t even hard enough to move Dedan’s head, but we could all hear a soft paff sound, and Dedan’s hair puffed out like a milkweed pod someone had blown against.\r\n Dedan stood still for a moment, as if he couldn’t quite understand what had happened.  Then he frowned and brought both hands up to give Tempi a more violent shove.  Tempi stepped away from this too, then swatted Dedan on the other side of his head.\r\n Dedan scowled, grunted, and brought his hands up, making fists.  He was a big man, and his mercenary leathers creaked and strained at the shoulders as he lifted his arms.  He waited a moment, obviously hoping Tempi would make the first move, then he stomped forward, drew his arm back, and threw a punch, hard and heavy as a farmhand swinging an axe.\r\n Tempi saw it coming and stepped away a third time.  But halfway through his clumsy swing, everything about Dedan changed.  He raised himself up on the balls of his feet and his ponderous haymaker punch evaporated.  Suddenly, he no longer looked like a lumbering bull, and instead, he darted forward and snapped out three quick punches, fast as a bird’s wing flapping.\r\n Tempi sidestepped one, slapped the other aside, but the third caught him high on the shoulder, spinning him partway around and knocking him backward.  He took two quick steps out of Dedan’s reach, regained his balance, and shook himself slightly.  Then he laughed, high and delighted.\r\n The sound softened the expression on Dedan’s face, and he grinned in return, though he didn’t lower his hands or move off the balls of his feet.  Despite this, Tempi stepped up, avoided another jab, and struck Dedan in the face with the flat of his hand.  Not across the cheek, as if they were squabbling lovers onstage.  Tempi’s hand came down from above and struck Dedan across the front of his face, from his forehead down to his chin.\r\n “Arrhhgh!”  Dedan shouted.  “Black damn!”  He staggered away, clutching at his nose.  “What’s wrong with you?  Did you just slap me?”  He peered out at Tempi from behind his hand.  “You fight like a woman.”\r\n For a moment, Tempi looked as if he might object.  Then he gave the first smile I had ever seen from him and gave a small nod and shrug instead.  “Yes.  I fight like a woman.”\r\n Dedan hesitated, then laughed and clapped Tempi roughly on the shoulder.  I half expected Tempi to dart away from his touch, but instead the Adem returned the gesture, even to the point of gripping Dedan’s shoulder and jostling him around playfully.\r\n The display struck me as odd coming from someone who had been so reserved over the last several days, but I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  Anything other than fidgety silence from the Adem was a blessing.\r\n Even better, I now had a measure of Tempi’s fighting ability.  Whether or not Dedan wanted to admit it, Tempi obviously had the better of him.  I guessed the Adem reputation was more than just empty air.\r\n Marten watched Tempi return to his seat.  “Those clothes are still a problem,” the woodsman said, as if nothing much had happened.  He eyed Tempi’s blood-red shirt and pants.  “Might as well run around waving a flag as wear that in the trees.”\r\n “I’ll talk with him about it,” I told the others.  If Tempi was self-conscious about his Aturan, I guessed our conversation would go more smoothly without an audience.  “And I’ll work out what he’ll do if he runs into them.  You three can go settle in and get dinner started.”\r\n The three of them scattered off, looking to claim the prime places for their bedrolls.  Tempi watched them go, then turned back to look at me.  He glanced down at the ground and took a small, shuffling step away.\r\n “Tempi?”\r\n He cocked his head and looked at me.\r\n “We need to talk about your clothing.”\r\n It happened again as soon as I started to talk.  His attention slowly slid away from me, his eyes drifting down and to the side.  As if he couldn’t be bothered to actually listen.  As if he were a sulky child.\r\n I don’t need to tell you how infuriating it is to try and have a discussion with a person who won’t look you in the eye.  Still, I didn’t have the luxury of taking offense or putting off this talk.  I’d already delayed this conversation too long.\r\n “Tempi.”  I fought the urge to snap my fingers in order to draw his attention back to me.  “Your clothes are red,” I said, trying to keep it as simple as possible.  “Easy to see.  Dangerous.”\r\n He gave no response for a long moment.  Then his pale eyes darted up to mine and he nodded, a simple bob of the head.\r\n I began to have a horrible suspicion that he might not actually understand what it was we were doing out here in the Eld.  “Tempi, you know what we are doing out here, in the forest?”\r\n Tempi’s eyes moved to my rough sketch in the dirt, then back up at me.  He shrugged and made a vague gesture with both hands.  “What is many but not all?”\r\n At first I thought he was asking some strange philosophical question, then I realized he was asking for a word.  I held up my hand and grabbed two of my fingers.  “Some?”  I grabbed three fingers.  “Most?”\r\n Tempi watched my hands intently, nodding.  “Most,” he said, fidgeting.  “I know most.  Talk is fast.”\r\n “We are looking for men.”  His eyes slid away as soon as I started to speak, and I fought the urge to sigh.  “We are trying to find men.”\r\n Nod.  “Yes.  Hunt men.”  He stressed the word.  “Hunt visantha.”\r\n At least he knew why we were here.  “Red?”  I reached out and touched the red leather strap that held the fabric of his shirt tight to his body.  It was surprisingly soft.  “For hunting?  Do you have other clothes?  Not red?”\r\n Tempi looked down at his outfit, fidgeting.  Then he nodded and went over to his pack and drew out a shirt of plain grey homespun.  He held it up for me.  “For hunting.  But not fighting.”\r\n I wasn’t sure what his distinction meant, but I was willing to let it go for now.  “What will you do if visantha find you in the forest?”  I asked.  “Talk or fight?”\r\n He seemed to think about it for a moment.  “Not good at talk,” he admitted.  “Visantha?  Fight.”\r\n I nodded.  “One bandit, fight.  Two, talk.”\r\n He shrugged.  “Can fight two.”\r\n “Fight and win?”\r\n He gave another nonchalant shrug and pointed to where Dedan was carefully picking twigs out of the sod.  “Like him?  Three or four.”  He held out his hand, palm up, as if offering me something.  “If three bandit, I fight.  If four, I try best talk.  I wait until three night.  Then . .  .” he made an odd, elaborate gesture with both hands.  “Fire in tents.”\r\n I relaxed, glad he had followed our earlier discussion.  “Yes.  Good.  Thank you.”\r\n The five of us had a quiet dinner of soup, bread, and a rather unimpressive gummy cheese we’d bought in Crosson.  Dedan and Hespe bickered in a friendly way, and I speculated with Marten about what sort of weather we might expect over the next few days.\r\n Other than that, there wasn’t much chatter.  Two of us had already come to blows.  We’d come a hundred miles since Severen, and we were all aware of the grim work ahead of us.\r\n “Hold on,” Marten said.  “What if they catch you?”  He looked up at me.  “We all have a plan if the bandits find us.  We head back with them and you’ll track us down on the third day.”\r\n I nodded.  “And don’t forget the distraction.”\r\n Marten looked anxious.  “But what if they catch you?  I don’t have any magic.  I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to track them down by that third night.  Probably, sure.  But tracking isn’t a certain thing. . .  .”\r\n “I’m just a harmless musician,” I reassured him.  “I got in some trouble with the Baronet Banbride’s niece and thought it would be best if I legged it into the forest for a while.”  I grinned.  “They might rob me, but as I don’t have much, they’ll probably just let me go.  I’m a persuasive fellow, and I don’t look like much of a threat.”\r\n Dedan muttered something under his breath I was glad I couldn’t hear.\r\n “But what if?”  Hespe pressed.  “Marten’s got a point.  What if they take you back with them?”\r\n That was something I hadn’t figured out yet, but rather than end the evening on a sour note, I smiled my most confident smile.  “If they take me back to their camp, I should be able to kill them off myself without much trouble.”  I shrugged with exaggerated nonchalance.  “I’ll meet you back at camp after the job is done.”  I thumped the ground beside me, grinning.\r\n I had intended it as a joke, sure Marten at least would chuckle at my flippant response.  But I’d underestimated how deep Vintic superstition tends to run, and my comment was met with an uncomfortable silence.\r\n There was little conversation after that.  We drew lots for the watch, doused the fire, and one by one we drifted off to sleep.\r\n CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE Signs\r\n"

        "text":"In the United States, hate speech is widely protected as a civil right (aside from usual exceptions to free speech, such as defamation, incitement to riot, and fighting words).  Laws prohibiting hate speech are unconstitutional in the United States;  the United States federal government and state governments are broadly forbidden by the First Amendment of the Constitution from restricting speech.  The \"reason why ﬁghting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey.\"  Even in cases where speech encourages illegal violence, instances of incitement qualify as criminal only if the threat of violence is imminent.This strict standard prevents prosecution of many cases of incitement, including prosecution of those advocating violent opposition to the government and those exhorting violence against racial, ethnic, or gender minorities.  Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers may sometimes be prosecuted for tolerating \"hate speech\" by their employees, if that speech contributes to a broader pattern of harassment resulting in a \"hostile or offensive working environment\" for other employees.  In the 1980s and 1990s, more than 350 public universities adopted \"speech codes\" regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students.  These codes have not fared well in the courts, where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment.Debate over restriction of \"hate speech\" in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of anti-harassment codes covering discriminatory speech."
