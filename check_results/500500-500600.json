        "text":" It was just after 5 a.m. and the summer sun was rising over the mountains as the Marguerite Explorer sailed out of the loch into the calm waters of the sea.  I was at the wheel – under the watchful eye of the captain.  A few of the other dozen passengers and crew were on deck, clutching mugs of coffee.  Suddenly someone shouted: a splash in the water, half a mile away.  In the morning light, a dozen dolphins, grey and graceful, were swimming straight towards us.\r\n The Hebrides, a group of islands off the Scottish coast, offer tourists a diversity of wildlife and scenery with few equals in the UK.  And in the waters around them you can find not only dolphins but whales and the mighty sea eagle as well.  In places it is possible to see such marine animals from the shore, but to have the best views, you need to be on a boat. \r\n There are now a number of companies offering such trips.  The Marguerite Explorer was the first boat to offer whale-watching holidays throughout the  Hebrides.  Under the command of Christopher Swann, the crew of the Marguerite have worked with some of the world’s leading sea-life scientists.  They are very knowledgeable guides to the islands.\r\n The Hebridan archipelago stretches nearly 250 miles from top to bottom, covers over a hundred miles from side to side, and has about 2,500 miles of coastline.  However, only about 40 out of the hundreds of islands are permanently inhabited.  This relative lack of people, together with freedom from pollution, helps to make the Hebrides a haven for rare flowers and plants.\r\n Despite being relatively unspoilt, the Hebrides are also facing many pressures.  Some of the islands are under threat from mining and throughout the islands, developments such as fish farms, which are vital to the local economy, affect the environment too.\r\n The Hebrides have their share of problems, but they are unbelievably beautiful.  Why, then, aren’t they packed with tourists?  While visitors are an increasingly important part of the island economy, tourism is still low key, compared with some other parts of Britain.  The answer may be that the prevailing Hebridan climate is wet and windy.  This is more than enough to put off the casual guest. \r\n Another discouraging factor is the wildlife the tourists least want to see – the insects, especially the mosquitoes.  Particularly between July and September, visitors can expect to be severely bitten.  Like so many wild places, the Hebrides can be hard on visitors.  But once you’ve watched dolphins leap through the dazzling water around your boat, you’ll think they are paradise.  And you will feel you will want to return to them, as I felt when I approached the end of my journey in the Marguerite Explorer."

        "text":"This is SCIENCE IN THE NEWS in VOA Special English.   I’m Shirley Griffith.  And I’m Bob Doughty.\r\n\r\n Today, we will talk about diet and weight loss.  Exercise is important if you want to get in good shape.  But experts say exercise alone is not enough if your goal is to lose weight.\r\n\r\n It is that time of year again.  Warm weather has returned to earth’s northern hemisphere.  Summer is a time when people of all ages feel like getting their swimwear and going to the nearest swimming pool or seashore.\r\n\r\n But first, there is that troublesome little thing called winter weight gain.  Many of us gain weight because of inactivity during the winter.\r\n\r\n Some people go to extremes to lose that extra weight before going to the beach.  In the weight loss industry, there is never a lack of ideas about how to lose weight.  Consider the \"Sleeping Beauty diet,\" where you sleep your way to weight loss.  You cannot eat if you are sleeping, or so the theory goes.\r\n\r\n Then there is the tapeworm diet.  The tapeworm is said to help people lose weight by eating the food that is stored in their stomach.  But first you have to be willing to swallow the little creature.  This may be more trouble than many people want.\r\n\r\n Strange, new diets, treatments and exercise programs arrive on the market every day.  Each one promises to help people lose weight and get a beach beautiful body.  The weight loss industry takes in billions of dollars each year, and it is growing.\r\n\r\n One research company says the weight loss business will be worth more than five hundred eighty billion dollars worldwide by the year twenty fourteen.  MarketsandMarkets also says the food and drink market represents the largest part of that growth.  It is expected to reach more than three hundred fifty five billion dollars by twenty fourteen.\r\n\r\n There is a seemingly endless supply of ideas about how to lose weight.  There are low-carbohydrate diets and low-fat diets, diets that limit calories and ones that let you eat as much as you want.  And, there are thousands of different kinds of diet pills and programs.  So where does one begin?  Which one is best?\r\n\r\n Experts say there is no single diet plan that works best for everyone.  Many experts agree on one thing: that to lose weight, you must use or burn off more calories than you take in.  When you eat more calories than your body needs, it stores that extra energy as fat.\r\n\r\n Calories are a measure of energy in food.  A pound of fat is equal to about four hundred fifty three grams or three thousand five hundred calories.  To lose that fat in a week, you have to burn off at least that amount in calories or eat that much less.  The best thing to do is to combine both ideas.  Eat fewer calories and increase physical activity so that you burn off more.\r\n\r\n America’s National Institutes of Health has suggested that women limit calories to no less than one thousand two hundred calories a day without medical supervision.  It also says men should have no less than one thousand five hundred calories.  Debate continues about the best way to fill those calorie requirements.\r\n\r\n For years, eating a diet low in fat was said to be the best way to lose weight.  A low-fat diet is one in which less than thirty percent of a person’s daily calorie intake comes from fat.\r\n\r\n Dean Ornish developed one of the most popular low fat diets after years of research on ways to control heart disease.  His dietary ideas were first published in the medical journal The Lancet in nineteen ninety.  The Ornish diet plan became more popular in nineteen ninety-three with the release of his book “Eat More, Weigh Less.”\r\n\r\n Dr. Ornish studied the effects of carbohydrates – one of the most important sources of energy for the body.  He found that carbohydrates were not to blame for making people fat.  Instead, he said, fat makes people fat.  He noted that a baked potato is not high in fat, but it becomes fatty when people add sour cream and butter to it.\r\n\r\n Dr. Ornish’s diet plan limits daily calories from fat to less than ten percent, with little to no saturated fat or cholesterol.  He also suggested that people get seventy to seventy-five percent of their calories from complex carbohydrates, and fifteen to twenty percent from proteins.\r\n\r\n Like other low-fat diets, the Ornish plan suggests that people eat diets high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and other legumes.  The plan advises people to avoid all meat and meat products, and to stay away from oils, nuts and seeds.  It does not limit the number of calories people eat.  But, eating the foods suggested by the diet plan would reduce the number of calories.\r\n\r\n The Ornish diet has proved to be effective for many people.  However, critics say it lets dieters eat too many carbohydrates while setting restrictions on calories from fat.  They also say the changes required in eating habits may be too extreme for many people to follow.\r\n\r\n Unlike the Ornish diet, low carbohydrate diets limit foods that are high in carbohydrates.  These diets advise people to avoid things like white flour, pasta, rice, potatoes and foods high in sugar.  Instead they suggest that people eat foods that are high in proteins and fats.  These include foods like meat, fish, chicken, eggs, cheese and nuts.\r\n\r\n The Atkins diet is one of the most popular of these diets.  It suggests that people eat fewer than twenty grams of carbohydrates a day.  This amount is slowly increased to  between forty and one hundred grams of carbohydrates a day to keep the weight off.\r\n\r\n Both weight loss plans have been carefully studied over the years.  But no one plan has come out as a clear winner.  Three years ago, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found low-carb diets to be the best at providing the most weight loss.  The study was led by researchers at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and Ben Gurion University in Israel.\r\n\r\n The researchers studied more than three hundred obese patients who followed one of three diet plans.  These included a low-fat diet, a low-carb diet and a Mediterranean diet, which is made up of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, olive oil and nuts.\r\n\r\n A similar study published a year later looked at more than eight hundred dieters.  The study found that low fat diets and high fat diets were equally successful at providing and maintaining weight loss over a two year period.\r\n\r\n The researchers concluded that the most important thing for any diet is that people stick with it.  And you must burn more calories than you take in no matter what you eat.\r\n\r\n Some people are unable to lose weight through diet and exercise, no matter how hard they try.  Others are just not willing to put in the effort.  Many of these people choose to have surgical operations to reach their weight loss goals.\r\n\r\n One kind of weight loss surgery reduces the size of the stomach.  This is done by separating the stomach into two parts, including a very small section at the top. "

        "text":"It was the day after Christmas, so everyone was more relaxed, even his mother.  And for once, they didn’t have to go to church.  Everyone played tennis and squash again, which seemed to be a daily ritual when they all got together.  Francesca still couldn’t remember anyone’s name, and she felt like she had dementia.  She was the only “Francesca” in the group.  The men all seemed to be named Chris, Bob, or William, and there were at least five of them with each name.  The women were Elizabeth, Helen, and Brooke.  His mother was Elizabeth with countless offspring of all ages named after her.\r\n The only one who seemed to be having any fun was Ian, who loved his cousins and was unhappy to leave.  Chris had a last breakfast with his mother on the day they left.  His father drove them to the airport and said he had loved meeting Francesca, and she felt like she had been in the twilight zone for three days.  It had been the weirdest Christmas of her life, and in spite of that, she still loved him, but she couldn’t wait to get back to New York and relax.  She wanted to scream with joy the minute they got back to the house.  They had been there for ten minutes when her mother called her from Gstaad.\r\n “I hope you had a nice Christmas,” she said blithely.  “I met the most divine man at dinner on Christmas Eve.  He lives in New York, he’s Swiss, he’s a banker, and he’s\r\n taking me to dinner as soon as I get back.”  Francesca could tell her mother was beaming, and she almost groaned.  It sounded like number six was on the way at last.  Wait till the Harleys heard about that.\r\n “Don’t rush into anything,” Francesca said wanly.  There was no stopping her mother when she had a potential husband in her sights.  And she hadn’t had one in too long, according to her.  And it wasn’t for lack of trying.\r\n “Of course not.  It’s just dinner, for heaven’s sake, not marriage.”  “That’s refreshing,” Francesca said, and her mother laughed.  “You don’t trust me, do you?”  “No, I don’t.  I figure you’re going to find number six one of these days.”  “What’s so wrong with that, if it makes me happy?”  her mother asked her, and for a\r\n long moment Francesca didn’t answer as she thought about it.  “You know, you’re right.  At this point, it doesn’t make much difference.  Five, six,\r\nand if you’re happy, to hell with what everyone else thinks.”  She had just spent three days with the most conservative, boring people on the planet, and they were a lot more obnoxious than her mother.  At least her mother had some style and spirit.  “Go for it, Mom,” she said, laughing.  “Do what makes you happy.  But if you throw me the bouquet at your next wedding, I’ll kill you.”\r\n “All right, dear.  See you when I get back.  I may stop in Paris first.”  When Francesca hung up, Chris was looking at her.  He was grateful she had gone to Boston with him and been a good sport.  His parents even said they liked her.\r\n “My mother is crazy,” she told him matter-of-factly.  “But I think I just figured out that I like her that way.”  It was a whole new way of looking at things, and she realized that it probably meant she had grown up and accepted her mother for who she was.  It was a first for Francesca.\r\n They went upstairs to bed that night, and Francesca had never been happier to be in her own bed, with Chris lying next to her.  She didn’t have to answer anyone’s questions.  He didn’t have to leap out of bed and run down the hall to his own room before seven, and she didn’t have to satisfy anyone’s assessment of what she should look like, wear, or say.  She was her own person even if she didn’t fit in.  She fit in here in her own house and world.  And she was totally happy in her own little universe with Chris next to her in his boxers and T-shirt, and Ian sound asleep downstairs.  And it was a very nice little life they shared.\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 24\r\n\r\n AT THE LAST minute, with nothing else to do, Chris and Francesca decided to go back to Vermont with Ian for the New Year’s weekend and use Marya’s house there.  They had no babysitter for Ian now with Marya gone, and they were happy to have him with them for a family weekend.\r\n They liked being together, and the revelry in the city didn’t appeal to either of them.  He had been invited to a few parties, and so had she.  But being in Vermont seemed like a nicer way to spend it, so they drove to Vermont the day before New Year’s Eve.\r\n Francesca went to the grocery store when they got there and got food for them.  Chris lit a fire in the living room, and Ian had brought DVDs and toys with him to keep busy.  It felt like the perfect way to spend the holiday to all three of them.  And it looked like a Christmas card when they woke up on the morning of New Year’s Eve.  It was snowing.  Francesca only wished that Marya could be there with them.  But she was in Courchevel in the Alps with Charles-Edouard and his friends.  Francesca had had several e-mails from her and she sounded happy.\r\n Francesca and Chris played Monopoly and Clue with Ian that night.  The two of them played Scrabble, and Gin and Go Fish with Ian.  And they slept in in the morning, and then played in the snow.  They made a snowman and had a snowball fight, and went skating at a nearby lake that was frozen, although Francesca was nervous for Ian.  She didn’t want him to fall through the ice, but he didn’t.  They toasted marshmallows and made s’mores.  They did all the things that all three of them liked, especially together.  It was a totally perfect weekend.\r\n Francesca heard her cell phone ring on the day after New Year, and she was almost too lazy to answer.  She finally got up and answered it, annoyed that it wouldn’t stop ringing.  It went to voice-mail twice, and they called again.  Francesca finally picked it up and was glad she did.  It was Marya, calling from Paris.\r\n “Guess where we are?”  Francesca said happily.  “In Vermont.  It’s been snowing for two days and it’s gorgeous.”  They were sleeping in Marya’s room, and Ian was in the four-poster in the guest room, as Marya had suggested the last time they came here with her.  “Happy New Year.”  She assumed that that was why Marya was calling.  “How’s Paris?”\r\n “Beautiful.  It snowed yesterday here too.  I think we found a flat on the rue de Varenne.”  It was exactly where they had wanted to be, in the seventh arrondissement.  “Charles-Edouard has been negotiating for it all week.”  She hesitated for a minute and then went on.  “I have something to tell you.”  Francesca waited, and missed her fiercely.\r\n “We got married yesterday.  Just the two of us and a few friends.  His divorce came through before Christmas.  The papers were here when we got back.  I feel a little crazy, but I’m glad we did it.  And if he ever cheats on me, I’ll kill him.”  They both laughed, and Charles-Edouard got on the phone a minute later, and Francesca congratulated both of them.  It was amazing how destiny intervened and life worked out.  Marya had thought she was going to be alone forever, and then his wife left him and everything changed.  Now five months later they were married.  A year ago she would never have dreamt that this could happen.\r\n “I’m so happy for both of you,” Francesca said.  She meant it, and Chris was beaming too.  They sounded so happy, and they deserved it.\r\n “I wish you’d been here,” Marya said wistfully, and Francesca wished she had been too.  It was one wedding she would have liked to be at, with two people who meant so much to her.  She and Chris were still smiling when they hung up, after talking to them for a few more minutes.\r\n They lay in bed afterward, talking about it, and how happy they were for them.\r\n “So when are we going to do that?”  Chris asked her.  For a long moment, Francesca didn’t answer.\r\n “I don’t know.  What’s the hurry?  Things seem to be working like this.”  They had only been dating for four months.\r\n “I’d like it better if we were married.  You’re not going to turn into your mother if we do,” he said, and she laughed out loud.\r\n “That’s probably true,” she admitted.  “I wouldn’t have the energy for five husbands.  And I sure as hell wouldn’t be looking for a sixth.”\r\n “How about just one?”  That had always seemed like one too many to her before.  “What do you think?”  He rolled over on his side, and looked at her, propped up on one elbow in bed, and he was smiling.  So was she.  For the first time, she wasn’t scared when she thought about it.  She didn’t need to get married, but maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing, and it might even be nice for Ian.\r\n “Maybe,” she said, and grinned.  It was as far as she was willing to go at the moment.  She wasn’t her mother, or Marya.  She had to find her own way with him.\r\n “That’ll do for now,” he said happily.  “I’ll settle for that.”  He kissed her as they lay in bed, just as Ian bounded into the room.  They were going back to New York that afternoon.  It had been a heavenly three days.\r\n “Let’s make another snowman,” he said, looking excited, and Francesca got out of bed.  They made two more snowmen to go with the one they’d done before.  There was a family of them now, right outside Marya’s windows.\r\n Ian waved goodbye to the snowmen when they drove back to New York.  On the drive home, Francesca was relaxed and peaceful.  She had heard recently that Todd was\r\n getting married in the spring, and she wasn’t upset about that anymore either.  She had her own life without him.  And Chris was perfect for her.  The pot had found its lid, and it was a perfect fit.  All she had had to do all along was find the right one.\r\n They got to New York late that night after a long drive, and Francesca helped Chris carry their bags into the house after he carried Ian up to bed, sound asleep.  She looked around as she set down their things in the hall.  The house seemed quiet and empty, and she looked surprised as she turned to Chris.\r\n “I want to sell the house,” she said softly.  He looked stunned.\r\n “Are you serious?  Why?  You love it.”  They both knew how hard she had struggled to keep it, even recently.  And a year before, she had been willing to live with three strangers so as not to lose it.\r\n “I do love it, or I did.  I want a fresh beginning for us, a new start ... a clean slate ...” She was thinking of Todd and Eileen when she said it.  “Too much happened here.  There’s too much baggage.”  She was instantly sure, as sure as she had been when she wanted to keep it a year before.  And Chris didn’t disagree with her.  He just didn’t want her to sell it if she loved it and wanted to stay.\r\n “Why don’t you sleep on it and see how you feel about it in the morning?”  he said, and she nodded, and then they went upstairs to their bedroom.  Ian was sound asleep in his own.\r\n She said the same thing to Chris the next day.  She looked at him over breakfast with a determined look.  “I want to sell it.  I’m sure.”\r\n “Okay.”  He nodded.  “Let’s put it on the market.”\r\n “It could take a while to sell.  It’s an old house,” she said cautiously.  That afternoon, she called the realtor she had used before.  They agreed on a price, and then she raised it a little bit.  They were putting it on the market that weekend.  She called Avery and told her what she was doing.\r\n “I think it’s a good idea.  The market is high right now, and you should get a decent price for it.  I haven’t felt right about that house for you since Eileen was killed there, but I didn’t want to say it.”\r\n “It’s not about her.  It’s about me.  I think I outgrew it.  I kept it when I wanted to.  But I think I want a life with Chris.  I don’t want a house that was part of another life.  Todd has a new life.  I want one too.  I feel like I’m dragging four hundred tin cans tied to my tail.  I want to be free.  And we need something new.”  It all made sense to her.  She told her the price that the realtor had quoted her, and it sounded fair to Avery too.\r\n “You’re not giving up the gallery, are you?”  Avery wondered if she was making a clean sweep, but Francesca was quick to answer.\r\n “Of course not.  I just feel like I outgrew this house.  It’s an albatross around my neck.  It’s too heavy, in too many ways.  Eileen, the cost of running it, the size of the mortgage\r\n payment, the repairs.  It’s too big for us without other people living in it, and I don’t want to do that again.  Maybe an apartment or a smaller house.  We can rent something for a while.”\r\n “See how fast it sells and how much you get for it,” Avery suggested.  Francesca was fully prepared to do that, and Chris was pleased.  He liked the idea of finding something with her.\r\n There was an open house that weekend, and two weeks later she had an offer.  It was for almost the full asking price.  And they had disclosed what had happened to Eileen there.  It made no difference, the people who wanted it loved it.  They had four children, and they could afford it.  Francesca was thrilled, and so was Chris.  He would never have asked her to sell it, and he would have helped her keep it if she wanted to, but he was happy she wanted to move on.  And he loved the idea of a fresh start for them.  She wanted a whole new life that was only theirs, not a hand-me-down from someone else, even if it was now hers.\r\n The house was due to close on the fifteenth of March.  On Valentine’s Day, they found an apartment to rent that they liked and was just the right size, and moved two weeks later.  Things were moving fast, which told her that everything was right.  And the family that was buying the house was thrilled with their new home.  It was a blessing for all concerned, and especially for Ian, Francesca, and Chris.  They had a new home, they were a new family, and they had a new life together.\r\n The day after they moved, Francesca went to the house alone to close it. "

However, a large number of people regain the weight in three to five years.\r\n\r\n A new report suggests similar results for another popular weight loss surgery.  Liposuction has been widely used since the nineteen seventies to improve the body’s appearance.  It improves body shape by removing fat from certain parts of the body.  The most common areas are the stomach, waist, hips, thighs, neck and arms.  The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says liposuction is the most popular form of cosmetic surgery worldwide.\r\n\r\n Recently, researchers at the University of Colorado School of Medicine found that the effects of the surgery may not be long-lasting.  They said people who have liposuction usually experience weight gain within one year after the surgery.  And the fat that comes back reappears in a new area of the body, most noticeably the shoulders, arms and upper abdomen.  The researchers say this is one more reason to try to prevent obesity before it happens."

        "text":"And I'm Steve Ember.  This week on our program, we hear from the author of a book about the makings of innovation.  Then, we learn how a Native American is bringing back the art and culture of his tribe from Alaska.  And later we tell you about an American naturalist and the results of his work in Africa.\r\n\r\n Simply put, innovation is doing something new that works.  Steven Johnson has written a new book called \"The Innovator's Cookbook.\"  Mr. Johnson says all progress depends on innovation and creativity.\r\n\r\n STEVEN JOHNSON: \"There is no kind of occupation that can't be improved with innovative thinking.\"\r\n\r\n Are there secrets to innovation?  Mr. Johnson talked to a group of innovative people.  They included businesspeople, software designers, artists and musicians.  Among them was composer Brian Eno.\r\n\r\n STEVEN JOHNSON: \"One of the great things that he does is that when he sits down in the studio to start working on an album, he often has the band switch up their instruments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n So think of the drummer playing guitar and the keyboardist playing violin.  How does it sound?  Pretty bad at first, Mr. Eno admits.  But he told Mr. Johnson that the process is liberating.\r\n STEVEN JOHNSON: \"They end up generating new sounds, new ways of playing together they wouldn't have gotten to otherwise.  That's a great metaphor for what you want to do in your own life.  Go and try things that you haven't tried before, and don't worry about sounding bad because what may happen is you're taken to some new place.\"\r\n\r\n Being open to new things also helped IDO, a design and innovation company in California, to expand around the world.  Mr. Johnson talked with IDO co-founder Tom Kelley for his book.  Mr. Kelley described a weekly meeting, held every Monday morning, for the company's top managers.\r\n\r\n STEVEN JOHNSON: \"That meeting, for twenty years, has started with show and tell.  People are asked to present interesting things they stumbled across that weekend.  Someone would say, 'Hey, I went to see a movie with my kids last night' or 'You guys seen this new game my kids are playing?'  or 'I went to an art gallery the other day and it's really interesting.'  Tom said it ends up triggering all these new associations and there is something unpredictable about it that leads to new ideas for their actual business.\"\r\n\r\n Steven Johnson shares his interviews in \"The Innovator's Cookbook.\"  It also includes nine essays written by business researchers.  These essays explore the conditions that can either allow creativity to grow, or kill it.\r\n\r\n One of those essays is by Teresa Amabile, a Harvard Business School professor and co-author of the book \"The Progress Principle.\"\r\n\r\n TERESA AMABILE: \"It is absolutely possible to kill creativity.  In fact, it seems to be more common inside most workplaces for the work environment to undermine creativity, to kill it, rather than to stimulate it and keep it alive.\"\r\n\r\n In her essay, Professor Amabile offers guidelines for supporting innovation in the workplace.\r\n\r\n TERESA AMABILE: \"First of all, people need to feel that they have some degree of autonomy in what they are doing.  They also need to feel personally involved in what they are doing, that they find it in some way interesting, satisfying, enjoyable and personally challenging.  When people are in that mindset, they're much more likely to come up with new and useful ideas.  People also need to feel, across the organization, they have encouragement for coming up with new ideas.\"\r\n\r\n Innovator's Cookbook\" author Steven Johnson says creative minds also need to work together, to collaborate.\r\n\r\n STEVEN JOHNSON: \"You think about Apple, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founding that company.  Very different people;  a brilliant engineer and a brilliant visionary and salesman, two totally different kinds of minds, and they needed each other.\"\r\n\r\n True.  But author Susan Cain wrote recently that \"If you look at how Mr. Wozniak got the work done — the sheer hard work of creating something from nothing — he did it alone.  Late at night, all by himself.\"  Ms. Cain, writing in the New York Times, noted Mr. Wozniak's own words to would-be inventors: \"I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take.  That advice is: Work alone.\"\r\n\r\n Susan Cain has just published a book called \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.\"  She wrote in the Times: \"Most of us now work in teams, in offices without walls, for managers who prize people skills above all.  Lone geniuses are out.  Collaboration is in.\r\n\r\n \"But there's a problem with this view.  Research strongly suggests that people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption.\"\r\n\r\n In other words, there can be too many cooks in the innovator's kitchen.\r\n\r\n David Boxley is a member of the Tsimshian tribe.  The tribe's home state is Alaska.  Mr. Boxley is a dancer, songwriter and wood carver.  He is also an ambassador for Tsimshian culture and heritage.\r\n\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"We call it art now, but it was a way for people to say, this is how I am.  This belongs to me, or this is my clan, this is my crest, this is my family history, carved and painted in wood.\"\r\n\r\n Mr. Boxley was raised by his grandparents.  He says the influence of Christian missionaries was strong while he was young, so he learned little about his native culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n After college, he went to work as a teacher.  He also began to research Tsimshian wood carving in museums and other cultural collections.  In nineteen eighty-six, he left teaching to spend his time on wood carving and bringing attention to Tsimshian art and culture.\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"I guess I came along at the right time.  Our people really needed a shot in the arm.  Our culture wasn't very prominent after all that missionary influence, and years and years of not having anybody be in that kind of position to guide.\"\r\n\r\n That was almost thirty years ago.  Since then Mr. Boxley has created seventy totem poles.  Totem poles tell a story.  Several months ago he began carving his most recent totem pole from a seven-meter-long piece of red cedar.\r\n\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"We don't use sandpaper.  We use the knives and the chisels to get it as smooth as possible.  Get the lines clean.\"\r\n\r\n He worked on it at his home near Seattle, in the northwestern state of Washington.  Then the totem pole was shipped by truck across the country to the other Washington.  It will stand in the permanent collection at the National Museum of the American Indian.\r\n\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"The title is Eagle and the Young Chief.\"\r\n\r\n The totem pole tells the story of a young chief who rescued an eagle caught in a fishing net.  Years later, when the chief's village was starving, the eagle repaid the chief for his kindness.\r\n\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"A live salmon fell out of the sky, and he looked up and he saw the eagle flying away.  And every day for days and days, the eagle brought salmon to feed the village.\"\r\n\r\n David Boxley has other wood carvings in the permanent collection at the museum.  His dance group of family and friends performed for a crowd on the day the totem pole was presented to the public.\r\n\r\n Mr. Boxley says a totem pole that he carved in honor of his grandfather is closest to his heart.  But this new one, at the museum, is a close second.\r\n\r\n DAVID BOXLEY: \"This one is going to be seen by millions over the next hundred years.  And it is not just me and my son;  it is all of my people that are proud.  My tribe.\"\r\n\r\n We have a video about David Boxley and his work at voaspecialenglish.com.\r\n\r\n Mike Fay calls himself a \"nature boy.\"  Mr. Fay is a naturalist and explorer.  His work has been supported by organizations like National Geographic and the Wildlife Conservation Society.\r\n\r\n In nineteen ninety-nine, Mr. Fay began a fifteen-month project called the MegaTransect.  He walked more than three thousand kilometers across the Congo basin to study plants and wildlife.  Mr. Fay and a team of Pygmy guides crossed the dense tropical forests of the Congo and Gabon.\r\n\r\n MIKE FAY: \"You know, we were [on] like an epic voyage out there.  Every day you have to find food for thirteen people, you have to keep everyone healthy, you have to be the mother, the father, the coach, everybody, for all these guys.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n Mr. Fay was gathering information about the plants and animals of the last untouched forests in west-central Africa.  He says he wanted to bring international attention to the rich biology that was being threatened by the logging industry.  But he admits that the local guides on his team did not really know what they were getting involved in.\r\n At one point, they stopped at a small village.  Mr. Fay warned his group not to drink the water because of the risk of disease.\r\n\r\n MIKE FAY: \"And sure enough, one of the Pygmies gets hepatitis like probably two or three weeks later.  And the first reaction of those guys to something like that is to scarify them with razor blades and bleed them, you know, to get the bad blood out.  And so here you've got this highly infectious guy, who all of a sudden everybody's touching his blood, and I just had these nightmares of the whole crew getting hepatitis.\"\r\n\r\n He says it took about a week to carry the sick man to a river.  Then they used a dugout canoe to transport him to safety.\r\n\r\n Mr. Fay documented his experiences on the MegaTransect.  He used a satellite-based positioning system, digital cameras and a laptop computer.  He and his guides cut through dense vegetation and crossed rivers and deep, muddy swamps.  Along the way, they saw elephants, aardvarks, gorillas and other wildlife.  They also saw roads and machinery that logging companies were using to remove trees.\r\n\r\n MIKE FAY: \"It was hard.  But we didn't lose a single person, and it was an expedition of a lifetime, for sure.\"\r\n\r\n The knowledge that came out of the trip, and the attention it received, helped lead Gabon to create thirteen national parks.  These placed more than four million hectares of forest under protection.\r\n\r\n Mr. Fay moved to Washington to write his findings after he finished the MegaTransect in two thousand.  But he says he had a difficult time re-entering city life after sleeping outdoors in the forest for so long.\r\n\r\n Mike Fay is now in his fifties.  Since the MegaTransect he has completed other surveys of biodiversity.  His latest trip was in two thousand seven.  He hiked three thousand kilometers through California's redwood forests.  But wherever he is, he says, he still tries to avoid sleeping inside.\r\n\r\n Our program was produced by Brianna Blake, with reporting by Faiza Elmasry, Jeff Swicord and Veronique LaCapra.

        "text":"The processes of globalization are constant and even irreversible today.  We can observe their results in all spheres of people’s life.  If spite of that the questions of globalization invoke more and more discussions.\r\n\r\n So how can we explain what globalization is?  There are lots of its definitions.  For some people globalization is associated with erasing of broads between countries, simplifying and speedup of making bargains.  For others it’s creating, development and spreading of unified culture and values.  Generalizing different opinions we can note that globalization is a condition when the entire world functions as a single system and each country makes own and special contribution into its work.\r\n\r\n Of course it’s impossible to define uniquely whether globalization is good or bad.  It has lots of supporters and opponents.  Let’s have a look at the influence of this process on different aspects of modern life and try to note c0its positive and negative sides.\r\n\r\n First globalization has a great influence on state economics.  The appearance of multinationals is one of its consequences.  Today all the world knows lots of different brands.  Wherever you are, you’ll more likely have an opportunity to eat at a fast-food restaurant MacDonald’s.  You can wash down your dinner with Coca Cola or Lipton tea.  As you see products of multinationals is offered in every country practically.  These firms offer a great amount of working places.  Corporations are engaged in charity sometimes.\r\n\r\n But at the time the multinationals prosper little firms often incur losses.  Actually it’s sometimes very difficult to resist in competition with worldly recognized companies.  As a result there is some aggregation and concentration of capitals in the hands of multinationals’ leaders.  Though there is a question if it’s that bad?  The business of such companies is quiet stable;  therefore it promotes in some ways the installation of stable economical relationships and economical growth.\r\n\r\n Another one peculiarity of globalization is speedup of life rhythm.  There is an impression that distances among countries shorten.  Today the trips for a couple of days on hundreds of kilometers have become a norm.  And if it was considered to be a great distance then now it’s not a problem.  From the other side such things condition increases the opportunities of emigrants wishing to leave their country to live in another one.  There is a new problem with this moment.  It’s a “brain drain” problem.  Some countries loose their highly specialized specialists in the end, and the costs for their education become ineffective for the state.  Though for the side accepting professionals it’s quiet favorably.\r\n\r\n Cultural peculiarities change with globalization too.  They unify in some ways.  Besides the mutual penetration of cultures and their exchange take place.  For example being in Russia you can find Chinese, Japanese, Georgian, French and many other restaurants.  With such means the inhabitants of one country get an opportunity to get acquainted with national peculiarities of other states.  At the same time young generation is under big influence of American culture which appears in modern cinema, music etc.\r\n\r\n But there is a negative side here.  Unfortunately preferring unified world culture we sometimes forget about our own one.  Traditions and customs are being lost.  The youth stops to be interested in them.  Besides less attention is paid to the development of the country culture in its own unique destination.\r\n\r\n Also there are lots of discussions if it worth regulating the business of multinationals and in what degree the state has a right to interfere with it.  Big companies open subsidiaries and representations all over the world.  But ever country has its own laws which often differ from those working abroad.  That is why it’s important for company subsidiaries to function in coordination with those normative acts which are installed in this state.\r\n\r\n The world economics theory proves that the most effective condition is achieved on an open market.  But unfortunately the total world effectiveness is estimated here.  Speaking of one country the conclusions can be quiet the opposite.  Sometimes there is a decrease of profits when branches which are not so well developed as in other countries come to an open market.  These branches incur losses and even stop functioning in the end.  And for the whole state that means a partly loss of independence from foreign suppliers.  Though developed countries win here of course.  They increase the sphere of their influence and enlarge the areas of their markets.\r\n\r\n The consequence of globalization is appearance of a flock of different international organizations which try to collaterally solve economical, political, and ethical and many other problems.  Though here the extent of countries’ influence on making decisions often differ.\r\n\r\n And the governments must carry on competent international politics.  Each state needs in interaction with other countries.  But they should open the broads and merge with the world in the degree when the state can worthy compete with other participants of the world market."

        "text":"The capital of Russia is Moscow.  Moscow was first mentioned in annals in 1147.  The city was founded by Yuri Dolgorukiy.\r\n\r\n There are lots of stories explaining the origin of its name.  Some scientists consider that the word “Moskva” goes back to the Sarmatian language and is translated “bend”.  There is also a legend that the founder of the city was not Yuri Dolgorukiy, but prince Mos who was a grandson of biblical Noy, and his wife Kva.  But of course this is far from the truth.\r\n\r\n Nowadays nearly thirteen million people live in Moscow including the suburbs.  Lots of people come here yearly to stay and live with the aim of earning money.  And that’s understanable because Moscow opens different perspectives which often can’t be compared with those offered in other country cities.\r\n\r\n Lots of people come here to get education.  There are a large amount of prestigious high schools which provide students with a high level of knowledge.  No doubt that the main university in the city and in the country is Moscow State University named Lomonosov.  It offers a wide range of specialities.  Thousands of entrants dream to go here.\r\n\r\n Muscovites quite often react negatively to the popularity of their city.  Really, sometimes it seems that Moscow is overfilled.  That is why traffic jams arise on the roads, prices on living places become higher etc.  In addition, those people who come to Moscow create competition for city inhabitants, for example, jobs.\r\n\r\n Most large cities in the world are situated near water.  And the Russian capital is no an exception, because there is the river Moscow (Moskva).  Actually in Russia it’s common for cities and the rivers running through to have the same name.  The river Moscow plays quite an important role as a shipping canal.  It connects the city with the Baltic, the Barentsev, the Azov, the Black and the Caspian seas.  That is why Moscow is sometimes called the port of 5 seas.\r\n\r\n And now let’s remember local tourist attractions.  It’s likely that the first place you visit coming to Moscow will be the Red Square.  Frankly speaking, only tourists usually walk on it.  Muscovites are seen here much less often.  The square has important historical meaning.  Right here there is the frontal place where tsar decrees were read from.  Also, pay attention to the amount of sightseeing situated near the square.\r\n\r\n Red Square is near the Kremlin.  The first Kremlin was built in 1368.  It was made of white stone.  And that is why Moscow was called 'white-stoned' in the past.  The modern Kremlin was built of red bricks.  Today the president and the government of Russian Federation work here.  The clocks of the Spasskaya Tower can be called the clocks which drive Russia.\r\n\r\n Also there is Vasiliy Blagenniy cathedral (St.  Basil's) near the Red Square.  It was built in the middle of the XVI century.  Lots of arguments arise during discussions of the exterior of the cathedral.  Some people even think that it doesn’t have any style.  Others on the contrary see something unique in it.\r\n\r\n There is a monument of Minin and Pogarskiy near the cathedral.  This is the oldest Moscow monument.  It was installed in honor of national home guard leaders releasing Moscow from Polish and Lithuanians in 1612.\r\n\r\n Tourists have a big interest in Vladimir Lenin Mausoleum.  To get there you’ll have to stay in a line even today.\r\n\r\n The historical museum is situated not far from the Red Square.  Here you can see a large number of interesting exhibits.  No doubt art lovers should also visit the Tretyakovskaya Gallery. "

        "text":" For the first time in his life, he is tempted to lie outright, because, in this case, the truth is not something of which he is proud.  He has no desire to admit to Nyota that he spent sixteen hours in bed doing nothing productive at all  —  doing nothing but having sexual intercourse with Kirk in every possible position.\r\n\r\n Even thinking about sex with Kirk makes Spock uncomfortable in his trousers and causes a warm sensation in his stomach, which consequently makes him appalled with himself for his utter lack of self-control.\r\n\r\n Before this madness began, he had never thought about sexual intercourse as something other than a physical necessity one had to indulge in on occasion in order to function at the highest efficiency.  Spock has always been quite proficient at sex   —   one should not do anything if one cannot excel in it   —   but with Kirk, sex is a different matter entirely.  Never had he wanted a coupling to be anything beyond a means to achieve sexual gratification.  Spock does not recognize himself with Kirk at all.  There are no precise, calculated touches  —  he touches because he wishes to, because he can’t not touch.  He constantly wishes to kiss and bite Kirk's skin, Kirk's mouth, Kirk's backside, his strong thighs, his oddly delicate knees.\r\n\r\n Nyota snorts.  \"You don't need to answer: it's in your eyes.\"  She raises her eyebrows, looking highly amused.  \"But didn't you say something about detesting him?  Something about that kiss being a mistake?\"\r\n\r\n Spock feels his blood rush to his cheeks and has to make a considerable effort to push it back.  The question makes him uncomfortable;  he simply does not know how to respond to it.\r\n\r\n \"I feel like I'm talking to myself, you know,\" Nyota murmurs, sipping her coffee.  \"But I guess it's a good thing that you guys are getting along.  The crew's noticed that you two had breakfast together the other day.  It's done wonders for your reputation.\"\r\n\r\n Spock stares at her in bewilderment.  Getting along?  Even the mere concept is ludicrous.  He and Kirk do not get along at all.  Kirk is still his obnoxious, arrogant, immature, infuriating self, and they argue approximately seventy-two percent of the time they spend in bed.  In many ways, having sex with Kirk is very much like attempting to ride a wild sehlat: there is scratching, growling, fighting, blood-spilling – and yet the experience is highly exhilarating.  \"You are incorrect, Nyota.  Our… interactions… have not improved.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh.\"  Nyota has a very odd expression on her face.  She shakes her head slowly.  \"I don't get it.\"\r\n\r\n \"You don't get what?\"  Kirk says, taking the seat he had vacated seven minutes ago to go resolve some matter between Lieutenant Robinson and Ensign Parker.\r\n\r\n \"I don't get how can you sleep together when you don't like each other even a bit.  It's bizarre.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk's hand freezes in the air for a fraction of a second before he picks up his huge mug of coffee.  \"Spock, didn't anyone teach you that gentlemen don't kiss and tell?\"  he mutters before looking at Nyota.  \"Well, I do like one thing about him.\"  He waggles his eyebrows at her.\r\n\r\n She snorts, then smiles slyly.  \"I was quite fond of that part of his anatomy myself.\"\r\n\r\n They laugh.  Spock acquires a strong urge to kill them both.  \"Would you mind not discussing my penis while I am present and attempting to eat?\"  he says evenly, focusing his attention on his salad.\r\n\r\n The topic does not embarrass him;  it is not something to be embarrassed about, not to mention that feeling embarrassment is illogical.  He simply finds it increasingly irritating when Kirk speaks with fondness about his penis, as if Spock the person is something insignificant attached to it.\r\n\r\n \"Stop pouting,\" Nyota says with a chuckle.  \"It was a compliment, Spock.\"\r\n\r\n \"I find such  —  \" Spock starts, but is interrupted when Doctor McCoy flops down on the seat next to Nyota with a yawn.\r\n\r\n Kirk looks at him with in surprise.  \"Did you seriously just get up, Bones?\"\r\n\r\n \"Rough night.  Olsen got worse again,\" McCoy says with another yawn, grabbing a mug with coffee.\r\n\r\n Spock frowns and notices Kirk stiffen beside him.  \"Is he all right?  Why didn't you tell me, Bones?\"\r\n\r\n McCoy scowls.  \"I would have, if I could find you.  He's better now, but…\" His face darkens.\r\n\r\n \"But you think he will never be fit for duty again,\" Spock says quietly, feeling a pang of regret.  Lieutenant Olsen is a fine engineer, devoted to his Starfleet career.  The news will no doubt crush him.\r\n\r\n McCoy blinks blearily a few times before his gaze fixes on Spock.  \"Yes,\" he says, looking at Spock with something akin to confusion.  \"His injuries won't allow him to perform his duties.  Honorable discharge.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk swears under his breath.\r\n\r\n \"I did everything I could, kid,\" McCoy says, rubbing his face wearily.  Nyota gives him a sympathetic look and puts a hand on his arm.  McCoy looks down at her hand and blushes slightly, appearing quite flustered.  His lips twist into something resembling a smile and a scowl at once.\r\n\r\n \"I know,\" Kirk says, sighing, but he looks stricken.  Spock stares at him.  It is a rare occurrence for him to witness Kirk express other emotions besides anger or amusement  —  or rather, Kirk rarely expresses such emotions where other people can witness them.\r\n\r\n Averting his gaze from Kirk, Spock finds McCoy staring at him with a rather bewildered look.  McCoy scowls.  \"Did I miss something?  Why are you eating with us again?  Jim, tell me we aren't suddenly friends with him, please.\"\r\n\r\n \"We aren't, Bones,\" Kirk says, looking at his mug.  \"You're free to keep hating him;  he still hates us back, don't worry.\"\r\n\r\n McCoy looks relieved.  \"Thank god.\"\r\n\r\n \"Spock is sitting right here, you know,\" Nyota says to him reproachfully.\r\n\r\n McCoy scowls again.  \"Unfortunately.\"\r\n\r\n Nyota rolls her eyes and says something, but Spock is not paying attention any longer.  His attention is diverted again to Kirk, who still appears to be far away.\r\n\r\n It makes Spock somewhat uncomfortable.  Kirk is not… He is not supposed to look like that.  When he pictures Kirk in his mind, he is always smiling  —  smugly, sheepishly, amusedly, arrogantly, but smiling.  This expression of misery does not belong to Kirk's face.  It is simply… wrong.\r\n\r\n \"I need to speak to Atenians about the second task,\" Spock says, causing the evident flirting between McCoy and Nyota stop and Kirk turn his head to him.\r\n\r\n \"Why?\"  Nyota says.\r\n\r\n \"Now that the clue to the second task has been solved, I need to ascertain how, exactly, another individual can assist me during the task and what preparations we should make.  Minister Santon said that we could come to him for further clarification as soon as we solved the clue,\" Spock says, addressing Kirk.  He hesitates before adding, \"Do you wish to accompany me?\"\r\n\r\n \"Me?  Really?”  Kirk's mouth falls open.  “Um, I – sure.\"\r\n\r\n \"Very well,\" Spock says, ignoring the narrow-eyed look Nyota is giving him.  McCoy looks like he has been just told that Earth's sky is green.  Spock stands.  \"If you are finished, I would like to leave now.\"\r\n\r\n \"Sure,\" Kirk says and follows him out of the room.\r\n\r\n They walk in silence that it not quite comfortable, but not strained, either.  The Enterprise crewmembers they meet along the way give them curious looks and start whispering as soon as Spock and Kirk are out of earshot (or so they believe).\r\n\r\n When they are on the third floor of the castle, where the offices of the tournament authorities are located, Kirk stops him by grabbing his wrist.  He clears his throat, looking rather confused.  \"Look, not that I don't appreciate it, but why are you being so… nice to me all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n Spock's gaze flickers to Kirk's hand circling his bare wrist before flickering back to his face.  \" 'Nice,' Captain?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, not nice exactly, but nicer.\"\r\n\r\n \"I was not aware that it was a crime.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk scowls.  \"Oh  —  you know what I mean.  You aren't acting like I killed your puppy, like you usually do, and it's weirding me out.\"  He smirks smugly.  \"Or was I that awesome in bed?\"\r\n\r\n Arrogant child, Spock thinks, but this time he does not feel even a twinge of annoyance.  He finds that he much prefers Kirk's arrogant childishness to the stricken look he wore at the meal.\r\n\r\n \"Certainly,\" Spock replies curtly.  \"What else could it be?\"\r\n\r\n Kirk glowers at him, but then grins, and, glancing around, pushes him into the nearest alcove.  Spock allows himself to be pushed against the wall, watching in fascination as Kirk presses his body against him.  \"If I knew that keeping your dick happy would make you nicer to me, I would've fucked you the very first day,\" he murmurs and kisses Spock lightly.\r\n\r\n Kirk pulls away, but Spock pulls him back and kisses him greedily, his arms coming up to wrap around him.  Kirk makes a soft noise and practically melts against his chest.  He feels so good  —  perfect  —  in Spock's embrace.  Spock knows it is illogical and unnatural to enjoy embracing someone so much, especially if this person is someone one dislikes, but he cannot deny himself the pleasure.\r\n\r\n He does not know how long they kiss, completely lost in the sensations caused by Kirk's mouth and body.  So it might have been seconds or hours later when Spock hears an audible gasp and Kirk stiffens against him.\r\n\r\n Spock's eyes fly open and he finds himself looking at Ensign Fadmani's wide brown eyes before she flushes and flees, her high heels sounding very loud against the stone floor.\r\n\r\n If he were not Vulcan, Spock would have cursed aloud.  Ensign Anne Fadmani is probably the biggest gossiper on the Enterprise.\r\n\r\n Groaning, Kirk presses his forehead against Spock's shoulder.  \"Who was that?\"\r\n\r\n \"Ensign Fadmani.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk groans again.  \"Oh, for fuck's sake.  Just our luck, I guess.\"  He sighs, pulling away from Spock.  \"What do you think are the odds of her not telling anyone?\"\r\n\r\n \"Zero,\" Spock says, straightening his clothes.  \"I calculate that there is a ninety-nine point six percent probability that the entire crew will know within an hour.\"\r\n\r\n \"I hate you.\"\r\n\r\n \"I am aware.  Shall we now proceed to the reason we are on this floor?\"\r\n\r\n Kirk blinks, as if he has completely forgotten it.  \"Right.  Minister of Sports.  Let's go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n Mr. Santon welcomes them with a smile, looking curiously from one to the other.  Spock wonders if the gossip already has reached his ears, but he doubts it;  too little time has passed.  \"Mr.  Spock, Mr. Kirk – please, have a seat.  How can I help you?\"\r\n\r\n \"We are here about the second task,\" Spock says, pulling out the parchment from his pocket. "

        "text":"Founded by Pavel Tretyakov it totals 100 thousand works of Russian painters and sculptors today.\r\n\r\n The Moscow metro deserves a word.  Some people consider it the most beautiful one in the world.  Each station has its peculiarities and doesn’t look like others.  The first line of underground started working here in 1935.  Nowadays the entire length of the underground lines is about 200 kilometers.  You’ll meet a lot of people with books in their hands in the underground.  This is so because they spend quite a big part of their day on transport and spend their free time here this way.\r\n\r\n A walk on the Arbat will be memorable for tourists.  Arbat is the main pedestrian street of the city.  Perhaps that is the best place in Moscow where you can buy souvenirs from Russia.  There are so many things you can find here!  Nested dolls, wooden spoons, caps with earlaps, copies of World War II signs, all these are sold here.  There is a great choice of places to eat on the Arbat.  And those who have some free time even can ask local painters to make their portraits.\r\n\r\n Of course there are lots of places which are worth visiting.  Theatres of the capital deserve attention.  The Bolshoy theatre is probably the most famous in Russia.  Not far from it there is the Maliy theatre and others.  In total 72 theatres operate in Moscow.  Furthermore in Russian capital you’ll find lots of cathedrals, museums, monuments.  It’s not likely that one visit to Moscow is enough to see even a half of its sights."

        "text":"Sport in Russia has always been popular.  Perhaps more then a half of Russians have tried some kind of sport in their childhood.  Some of them even in several types.\r\n\r\n So which sports are better developed in Russia?  Here can be seen the following pattern.  Russia, as a rule, has good results in classical kinds of sport.  This is in some ways connected with the period of Soviet Union when big attention was paid to physical education of the youth.  But the lessons of Soviet school didn’t go without any influence.\r\n\r\n Quite often foreign sportsmen, lead by Russian trainers, appear on world level competitions.  Also often you can see Russian sportsmen fighting of medals for other countries.  That of course upsets Russian supporters.  But they have already learnt to treat this with humour.  There are many jokes about it.  For example when you watch international competitions you hear that the trainers and the sportsmen easily understand each other because they all speak Russian.\r\n\r\n In modern kinds of sport Russians lag behind their contenders a little.  We can refer here curling, springboard jumping etc.  Frankly speaking some Russians still can't see these activities as a serious kinds of sport.  But the situation has been changing nowadays.\r\n\r\n Actually, a healthy way of life is again coming into fashion in Russia today.  That is why people have started to take an interest in sport.  Even those who perceived it only as something that they could watch on TV, now come to gyms and swimming pools.  That is why Russians are beginning to open to new kinds of sport.  Let’s hope that this will reflect in results of different level competitions.\r\n\r\n Tennis has a large popularity.  Some people connect that with the fact that this sport was a hobby of Russian ex-president Boris Yeltsin.  Today Russian tennis players are famous all over the world.  Sharapova, Kurnikova, Kafelnikov, Miskina are only the best known Russian tennis players.  They play wonderfully at Wimbledon and other competitions.\r\n\r\n Ice-hockey is another one successful sport in the country.  The Russian team takes worthy places in competitions.  The traditions of Soviet school are kept here too.  Though unfortunately it isn’t as strong as in the past.  In USSR there was a period when hockey team won 9 world championships in a row.  Furthermore, there are only 2 hockey players which became championship winners 10 times.  These are Russian sportsmen Alexander Rogulin and of course Vladislav Tretyak.  Nowadays there are also good players in Russian hockey.  Many of them train in NHL.\r\n\r\n Another sport which is widespread in the country is football.  It’s strange but in Russia there are still many amateurs of this game.  But unfortunately there are only few professionals.  Russians have already thought up a lot of jokes about their football team.  The fact is that Russia hasn’t got any prizes in this kind of sport for a long time.  Some people even think it is remediless.  Although football matches are always broadcasted on central TV and find their spectators.\r\n\r\n An interesting peculiarity of Russian football is its multinational compound.  Spartak, TsSKA, Zenit, Locomotive are names of best known football clubs.  But if you listen to the information about the team compound in the start of the match it’s not very likely that there will be a half of Russian players there.  Maybe that is one of the problems of Russian football.  Perhaps it’s difficult for players just to understand each other.  And football needs playing in a command.\r\n\r\n And of course the favorite sport of many women is figure skating.  This is a very beautiful show.  And here Russia is still the leader.  Though it has had very worthy rivals in the last years.  For example Chinese sportsmen who to my mind have good perspective.  But don’t forget about Russian figure skaters.  Today they are favorites at any competition.  Besides figure skating is quickly getting popularity in the country.  New ice rinks are opened, parents take their children to sport schools.\r\n\r\n Actually many kinds of sport are popular in Russia.  Both on a professional level and on an amateur one.  Ski sport and volleyball are good examples here.\r\n\r\n We should say some words about Russian supporters.  Here we can call it a kind of sport too.  The sense of empathy is inherent to Russians.  The team spirit lives in them.  That is why they are always ready to root with pleasure for their compatriots.  Russians prepare for going and supporting their favorite team in advance.  They buy flags which sometimes achieve great sizes.  On the scarves, caps and even on paces – everywhere it’ll be possible to see the colours of Russian flag.\r\n\r\n When you watch the competitions of the international level on TV then you’ll here through the voice of commentator the tribunes scanning “Rossya!  Rossya!” .  And no matter where the match takes places in Russia or in 1000 km from it you’ll anyway hear this.  Russians are ready to overcome big distance to see the performance of their sportsmen.\r\n\r\n Maybe that is strange but cheerleading in Russia is absent.  Only for last years under the influence of American films this idea has started to get into the youth’s heads.  So I think this kind of sport will soon develop here too."

        "text":"Like in many other countries there is obligatory military service in Russia.  The term has been changed lately.  For example it lasted 2 years in the past then now it’s only a year and a half.  Besides the government is considering the possibility decreasing this term.\r\n\r\n In Russia men are called to the army when they are 18 years old.  The age when they stop doing it is 27 years.  There are some reasons which can prevent a guy from getting into the army.  First this is health condition.  Before getting to the army each potential recruit passes medical commission which confirms his readiness to serve the country.  Furthermore, right here a young man is directed to this or that army structure.\r\n\r\n Another reason is completing higher education.  But it just affords a delay from army for the time of studying.  Though some universities have so called military faculties.  And if a student passes it then it’s equivalent to going to the army.  Also if a young man finishes postgraduate study then he is not called to the army.  Besides men who have children who are younger than 3 years old are free from the service.\r\n\r\n If a guy gets to the army then he serves at one of its divisions.  In Russia there is the Military Air fleet, the Air Crew army, the Military Marine fleet, the Overland army, and the Building battalion.  Service at any of these divisions has its won specifics.\r\n\r\n Each recruit takes the oath in the army.  By that he promises to protect the Native land, to keep the Constitution and its other laws and also the charter of military service.\r\n\r\n Everyone in the army has its identification signs.  They give to others some information.  Shoulder straps, loop emblems and chevrons are main signs of distinction of military people in the Russian Army.  It’s easy to define military rank with an amount of stars on a shoulder strap and with their size.  On the right shoulder of the servant there must be a chevron with the image of Russian flag and the inscription “Russia – the Armed Forces” or “Russia – the Military Marine fleet” – if a man serves in fleet.  There are special breast signs situated on the right.  And on the left there is a stripe messaging the blood group and the Rhesus factor.\r\n\r\n Soldiers live in barracks.  The order of their maintenance is strictly described in the Oath of Inside Service.  Actually all main moments connected to army service are in this oath.\r\n\r\n What is a usual soldier’s day in the army like?  The day regime is defined by special order.  The company gets up with a command “Uprise!”  Then morning gymnastics is lead.  After cleaning of the rooms the company is marshaled for the morning inspection.  The presence of servants and their uniform is checked at inspection.\r\n\r\n The main occupation of soldiers in the peace time is training actions.  Sport trainings are lead here.  Also military servants are taught to deal with weapon.  They are given different tasks which they must carry out.  Sometimes military teachings are held at night.  This helps to keep battle readiness for the army at any time of the day.\r\n\r\n By the way if a commander gave an order to a subordinate then that must obligatorily carry it out.  It’s strictly forbidden to discuss orders in the army.\r\n\r\n They feed 3 times a day in the army.  It must be some time for rest after each meal.  For example after dinner it is not less than 30 minutes.  At this time it’s forbidden to hold any training actions.\r\n\r\n At the end of the day there is an evening walk.  At the time of evening walk servants perform front songs.  After that they check the staff of the company.  The military goes to bed with the command “Release”.\r\n\r\n Also there is a combat maintenance standby.  At the time of the maintenance standby the military men are forbidden to leave the combat post and to distract at other things.  Besides they can’t pass their duties even temporarily anyone else without the commander’s order.  At the time of day maintenance standby military men are allowed to sleep for some hours.  In turn of course.\r\n\r\n On holidays military servants are allowed to go to bed an hour later than usual.  They can use this time like they want.  Some people watch cinema, some people just relax, and some proplr write letters.  Actually soldiers always look forward to letters from home.  They are practically not let off from the service that is why they miss their city, nearest and dearest alot.  Besides letters is the only way for them to get news from relatives and friends.\r\n\r\n Once a week they have a right for dismissal.  But they must be back to service in the evening.  The military must report about their coming to people on duty.  Usually they are allowed for dismissal due to a special schedule.\r\n\r\n It’s strictly forbidden to drink alcohol in the army.  If a military man is under alcohol or drug intoxication it’s considered that he doesn’t carry the service.  Besides he’ll get a punishment.  Often they use an extra order without turn as a punishment.\r\n\r\n Sometimes women also carry military service.  But they are not obligated to do it.  Such decisions they take themselves.\r\n\r\n After the army servants go back home.  Here they can enter university on benefit conditions.  Some people continue military service by their wish.  Anyway the army changes people and their views on life greatly.  Often it makes them more mature.  That is why some people think that every man must serve in the army."

        "text":"During the times of the Soviet Union, space exploration was one of the main priorities.  And a rocket undertaking the first flight into space departed from the USSR.  That happened on the 12th of April, 1961.  This day became an important part of history.  The cosmonaut on board was pilot Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin.  Let’s find out something about the life of this truly heroic person.\r\n\r\n Yuri Gagarin was born on the 9th of March in 1934 in Clushino village, Smolensk area.  He was a native from simple country family.  Later he finished Lubertsy School in Moscow, then Saratov Technikum School.  By the way, in Saratov he studied in the aero club.\r\n\r\n He married Valentina Goriacheva.  Soon he had two wonderful daughters, Lena and Galia.  So what kind of person was Gagarin?  It’s really hard to find the answer to this question.  This is in some ways connected with attempts of the Soviet authorities to keep the typical image of a hero which must be an example for young generation.  And he rally became it.  Practically every schoolboy when asked the question about the job of dreams, answered that he’d like to be a cosmonaut.\r\n\r\n No doubt that the main event in the life of Yuri Gagarin became his flight into space (cosmos) which he made on the craft “West”.  This flight lasted 108 minutes.  The rocket flew around the Earth and then came back to the orbit.\r\n\r\n 108 minutes now seems not a long time spent in space.  But just think what that meant for a person who knew that he was the first one to do it.  No doubt the flight was connected with tremendous risk.  And Yuri Gagarin understood that clearly.\r\n\r\n The testimony on it is his farewell letter which he has written to his wife.  Gagarin asks her not to experience much if he perishes during the flight.  Also the cosmonaut speaks there about his children, that he loves them very much and hopes that they will get good education.  But Gagarin hadn’t given the letter to the wife.  Instead of that, the cosmonaut hid it at home.  Valentina Goriacheva found it after the death of her husband.  So why hadn’t he given her a letter at once?  Maybe he didn’t want to scare her.\r\n\r\n Before the flight Yuri Gagarin was given an envelope where the secret cipher was – the figure “25”, as it was found out later.  This cipher allowed going from planned automatic to manual operation of the spacecraft in case of malfunctions.  Why wasn't the message cipher given to the cosmonaut in advance?  The reason is that psychologists proved that a person having seen his planet from the space is more likely to go mad.  That is why the cipher wasn’t messaged at once so that the cosmonaut wouldn’t start running the craft in madness.\r\n\r\n Before the flight informational agency had prepared 3 variants of messages reporting how it goes.  In the first one it was told that all went successfully.  The second one reported that the craft couldn’t leave the orbit and its wreck took place on the Earth.  This variant also addressed to governments of other countries and asked for help in searching of the cosmonaut.  And the third one declared that the first cosmonaut tragically perished.\r\n\r\n Fortunately the flight went successfully.  Yury Gagarin became the first person in space.  Right after landing the cosmonaut was driven to the meeting with Nikita Khrushchev.  And the next day Yuri Gagarin was standing in front of the Red Square with the most high-ranking capital inhabitants.  Here he was greeting a crowd of people who came with posters and pictures of the cosmonaut.  Still not understanding that he had already become a national hero.  When the cosmonaut met his wife he said that he hadn’t expected it to be that way.  He had thought that he would do the task, come back and his usual life would continue.\r\n\r\n But all appeared absolutely different.  After the flight into space, Yuri Gagarin became a person representing the USSR.  He was given the rank of Soviet Union hero.  Also from a lieutenant he was at once raised to a major.  Soon they found out about his glory abroad.  The awards just fell down on the cosmonaut.  He had become a Work Hero of Bulgaria, Czechia, Vietnam.  Many cities recognized him their honorable citizen.  Smolensk, Saratov, Sevastopol, Sophia, Plovdiv, Athens, Limasol, Saint-Denis are among them.  And it’s hard to remember all the orders, signs and medals.\r\n\r\n Everyone dreamed to shake his hand, to speak with a hero.  His smile had become one of the symbols of Soviet Union.  He wasn’t allowed to go on space flights anymore.  They said that he had already carried out his duty to the Native land.  Though Yuri Gagarin was directed to solemn meetings all over the world.\r\n\r\n Unfortunately in 1968 Yuri Gagarin tragically during a training mission.  An accident with the engine took place.  Though lots circumstances of the accident look quiet mysterious.  There are even versions that when a plane started falling the pilots weren’t alive already.  Or that the official place of the crash is situated on 30 kilometers from the real one.  But we’ll hardly ever know how truthful these versions are.  Yuri Gagarin was buried near the Kremlin wall on the Red Square.\r\n\r\n Today the Gjatsk city where the first cosmonaut spent many years has been renamed to Gagarin.  Also the crater on a backward side of the Moon and the asteroid №1772 carries his name.  Lots of streets, squares and prospects were named after him.  And the 12th of April – the day when the first man flew to space - is a holiday.  This is the day of Cosmonautics."

        "text":"Remnants of socialism in Russia\r\n\r\n For lots of foreigners Russia is still associated with the period of USSR.  Although there have been many changes since the times of socialism, some things have been kept today.  If you come to Russia then you’ll notice these things.\r\n\r\n No matter which city you are in, you will more than likely see a Lenin’s square.  Actually the Lenin’s squares are main squares of most of Russian cities and towns.  They are still called so and are usually situated in front of administration buildings.  Each square is decorated with a monument of Lenin.  No, the monuments look different everywhere.  Anyway if you are lost in the city ask someone where the Lenin’s square is and you will likely be guided to the city centre.\r\n\r\n Of course, that’s not all that remained of the exterior appearance of the city from the times of socialism.  Lots of streets, prospects and lanes still carry the names given to them soon after the finish of revolution.  For example the Prospect Revolution, Karl Marks’ Street, Plekhanov’s street and many others.  City architecture also reminds of the USSR period.  On the face sides of buildings social slogans and images of the hammer and sickle can be seen quiet often.  These symbols always remind inhabitants and tourists of the history of the city and the country.\r\n\r\n Also a lot of buildings of that period have been kept.  Living houses are among them.  In Russia there are flats usually called 'stalinkas' and 'khruschevkas'.  Stalinkas were built at the times of Stalin and khruschevkas at the times of Khruschev.  But these words speak not only about the periods in which they were built.  You have to look once at a flat to define what of those types it is.  You will see spacious rooms, long corridors, and high ceilings in stalinkas.  Khruschevkas are on the contrary very small in size.  Only necessary minimum of space is given here.  Of course that is connected with history.  In Khruschev’s times there were problems of providing the population with flats.  And lots of flats were built but of a smaller size to help as many people as possible to get a place for living.  And in the period of Stalin the accent was made for quality and durability.\r\n\r\n Furthermore, houses were often built by plan and in big amounts.  That is why nowadays you can see several blocks of flats looking absolutely the same on one street.\r\n\r\n During the time of socialism lots of names appeared.  All of them helped the ideology in the country.  Let’s look at it on the example.  Vladlena is a female name arisen in the socialism period.  Do you have any guesses?  And if to rewrite it this way - VladLena?  As you see it is created with cutting-down and integration of Vladimir Lenin’s name and surname.  The same story is with a male name Vilen, but now it’s originates from Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.  Female name Dazdraperma is often taken as an example.  That means “Da zdravstvuet pervoe maya!”  – “Glory to the 1st May!”  Actually the 1st may was a Holiday of Spring and Work in USSR.  But I’m not sure that somebody really called their daughters this way.  Also Industrya (Industry) and Olympyada (the Olympics) were includes into the list of names.  Of course such names are already not used today.\r\n\r\n An important role was played by science achievements of the socialism period.  Many scientists of world importance worked during that time!  Actually a big emphasis was made on science in Soviet Union.  And the results amaze of course.  As an example the work made for space research can be taken.\r\n\r\n There is no doubt that such an attitude to science required highly qualified specialists.  The Soviet Union had a big advantage due to the level of education it offered.  Big attention was paid to education of the future generation.  Each pupil had deep knowledge of history, literature, mathematics and many other disciplines.  And this knowledge was not limited at the school level.  Children were stimulated to getting extra knowledge and self-education.  The only minus here was weak teaching of foreign languages.  Fortunately, today a quiet good level of education is still given in Russia.\r\n\r\n Russia is also in debt to the Soviet Union for its sport results.  Free sport schools have still been kept here for children.  Different competitions are always held.  Lots of stadiums, swimming pools and so called sport palaces were built in the time of USSR.  That gave many kinds of sports an opportunity to develop.  Nowadays our trainers and sportsmen are demanded abroad.  The results of the Olympics please Russians today.  For example on the Olympics in Turin Russian figure skaters got 3 golden medals of 4 possible.  Also the (ice) hockey team performs quiet well.  Although it’s not as strong as it was in the times of USSR when it could just be called a legendary team.\r\n\r\n Many holidays have been kept in Russia from the socialism period.  On the 1st of May they celebrate The Holiday of Spring and Work.  And on the 9th of May a famous Victory Parade devoted to the end of World War II is held.

Most of countries – ex-Soviet Republics are now in Commonwealth of Independent States.  The closest relationships are of course kept with Byelorussia and Ukraine.\r\n\r\n But of course the most important thing remained after socialism is the mind of adult population.

He receives a sheepish smile in return.  \"I wish to ascertain how exactly another individual's voice is supposed to help me to defeat the creature if I cannot hear.  Can I choose any individual, or are there some requirements I do not know of?\"\r\n\r\n Mr. Santon glances at the parchment handed to him by Spock before looking back at him.  \"I see you have solved the clue,\" he says, righting his glasses.  \"Excellent.  Well, while you certainly have the right to know, is there a reason why Mr. Kirk is present, as well?\"\r\n\r\n Spock feels Kirk's gaze on his face but doesn't look at him.  \"Perhaps there would be,\" he says simply.  \"I assure you that the Captain would not share anything he learns here with the other champions.  It would be illogical for him to do so.\"\r\n\r\n Mr. Santon nods.  \"Your point is sound.  Very well.  Regarding your first question, the answer is quite simple: we will use a spell to connect your mind with a mind of the person you choose.  However, that spell has certain limitations and it can be sufficiently strong only if there is certain trust between two people.\r\n\r\n \"I believe that also answers your second question: you can pick any individual, but you should choose wisely.  If you choose the wrong person, and it turns out during the task that the link between you isn't strong enough, we might not be able to stop the task and retrieve you immediately.\r\n\r\n The minister grimaces.  “I'll be honest : the creature you'll face during the second task is far more dangerous than the one you faced in the first task.  You will face a demon we call Belshazzar.  He cannot be killed through usual means or even through magic – only by using a special dagger.  You will receive one, but even with the dagger, you will be helpless if the person you choose will fail you.  So again, you should choose carefully, Spock.  Your life might depend on it, and unfortunately, I'm not exaggerating.  Admiral Nogura had his doubts about allowing his officers to participate in such a dangerous task, for good reason.\"\r\n\r\n Spock nods, having received the answer he expected.  \"Thank you, Minister.  I will inform you of the individual of my choice by tonight.  Is that sufficient?\"\r\n\r\n Minister Santon inclines his head.  \"If I am not here, I will be in my quarters next door.  If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask me.”  He stands.  “Gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n As soon as they leave the office, Kirk grabs his arm again.  \"So why did you want me to come with you?\"\r\n\r\n \"I wished for you to hear for yourself what he has to say before making any decision.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk freezes and turns to him slowly, his eyes impossibly wide.  \"You mean…\"\r\n\r\n Clasping his hands behind his back, Spock inclines his head slightly.\r\n\r\n Kirk flushes.  \"Really?\"  he says, almost breathlessly, then chuckles.  \"Damn, I knew I was good in bed, but I didn't know I was that good.\"\r\n\r\n Spock gives him an unimpressed look.  \"This has nothing to do with those particular talents of yours.\"\r\n\r\n Tilting his head, Kirk examines him, his eyes going hard.  \"Then what does it have to do with?  Because I don't understand you, Spock.  We're a shitty command team, we argue about everything, you humiliate me at least three times a day in front of the bridge crew, and now you're telling me that you trust me?  That I'm the person you trust the most?  Are you kidding me?\"\r\n\r\n Spock questions the wisdom of his decision again, but comes to the same unsatisfying conclusion: Kirk is the best option. "

        "text":"Basketball is an extremely popular all around the world.  The object is to put a ball through a hoop, or basket, and thus score more points than the opposing team.  Teams comprise of ten players, with a maximum of five on court at any one time.  Substitutions are unlimited during the course of the game.  Although basketball can be played outdoors, it was invented to serve as an exciting indoor exercise for the winter months in a northern climate.  It quickly became a spectator sport, however, and now attracts large audiences to gymnasiums and arenas, especially in the United States, South America, and Europe.  The sport is played on the amateur level by schools, colleges, other groups, and, since 1936 by national teams in the Olympic Games.  It also is played by professional athletes, notably in the United States and Europe.  The foremost American championships contended for are those of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for professionals, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for colleges.  Britain has National Associations for each country and the English Basketball Association (EBBA) runs amateur national competitions, the National Basketball League (NBL) is run by Basketball League Ltd for professionals.  International competion is organised by the Federation of International Basketball (FIBA).  It all started with two peach baskets in a YMCA in Massachusetts.  In 1891 James A Naismith (1861-1939), a leader of the Springfield YMCA, was thinking about ways of providing exercise for the young men in his care.  As a physical education instructor he taught gymnastics, however he was looking for something new.  He had the idea of nailing peach baskets onto the balconies as goals, at either end of the gymnasium and throwing a soccer ball into it from below.  So a National and International game was born.  In 1892 he published the first booklet containing the basic rules, almost unchanged today (although expanded upon considerably!) .  These rules were adopted by the YMCA and the Amateur Athletic Union.  Word spread quickly amongst YMCA's in the Eastern United States about this new game.  It took off so rapidly that the first intercollegiate game was played in 1897, and the first professional league in the following year.  The Eastern Intercollegiate League was formed shortly afterwards, in 1902.  Women also took up the game before 1900.  The growing popularity of basketball resulted in improvements in equipment and skills.  The metal hoop was introduced in 1893, and backboards in 1895.  The soccer ball was replaced by the first basketball.  As playing skills also became more sophisticated, the game attracted more and more spectators.  Until the late 1930s, scores were low, sometimes in single digits.  After each score, opposing centers (one of the five positions, the others being two guards and two forwards) lined up in the middle of the court and jumped for the ball.  Then the team that got the ball would pass or dribble until a player was about 3 m (10 ft) from the basket before trying a shot.  The slow pace did not inhibit the growth of the game, however.  By the 1920s, basketball was being played all over the United States, and tournaments were being conducted in high school and college gymnasiums.  Most states held high school championships for boys.  Several events in the 1930s spurred the growth of the game as a spectator sport and at the same time made basketball more exciting for the players.  The first of these came in the 1932-33 season (basketball seasons tend to run from Autumn through to Spring) rules designed to speed up play were adopted.  It became mandatory, under penalty of losing possession, to move the ball past midcourt in less than ten seconds.  In addition, no player was permitted to remain within the foul lanes for more than three seconds.  Then in 1934 a New York sportswriter, Ned Irish, persuaded the promoters at New York's Madison Square Garden, a large arena, to schedule doubleheaders between college teams.  These events proved successful, and similar promotions followed in other cities.  Before long, colleges began building their own arenas for basketball.  Another significant advance occurred in 1936, when a Stanford University team traveled from California to a Madison Square Garden promotion to challenge the eastern powers in the \"cradle of basketball.\"  Opponents and fans were stunned by the Stanford style of shooting—one-handed while jumping, which contrasted to the prevalent method of taking two-handed shots while standing still.  One Stanford player, Hank Luisetti, was so adept at the \"jump shot\" that he could outscore an entire opposing team.  The new style gained universal acceptance, and basketball scores rose remarkably.  In the 1937-38 season the center jump following each field goal was eliminated.  At the end of the next season, Madison Square Garden brought in college teams from around the nation for the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a postseason playoff that was adopted (1939) on a wider scale by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).  Although the NIT is still held annually, the NCAA tournament serves as the official intercollegiate championship.  The University of Kentucky (coached, 1930-72, by Adolph Rupp), St. John's (in New York), the University of North Carolina, Western Kentucky, Kansas University, and Indiana University have been among the leading college basketball teams for years.  From 1964 to 1975 the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), coached by John Wooden and led by the centers Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton, dominated the intercollegiate play-offs, winning the title an unprecedented 10 times in 12 years.  The 1,250 college teams in the United States now draw about 30 million spectators per season.  Although women have played the game since the 1890s, and even though a few states (Iowa, for instance) have shown great participatory and spectator interest in secondary-school women's basketball for some decades, significant growth and serious recognition of women's basketball in the United States and elsewhere did not occur until the 1970s.  Almost all U.S. states now hold girls' high school tournaments, and basketball is the fastest-growing women's intercollegiate sport.  From 1898 on, many attempts were made to establish professional basketball as a spectator sport-but success did not come until 1946.  The best of the early efforts was made by the Harlem Globetrotters, an all-black team that toured first only the United States and then internationally to play local professional or semi-professional teams.  The Globetrotters, founded in 1926, were not affiliated with a league.  Their style was and is often showy because, at least into the early 1950s, they could dominate all opponents.  In 1946 serious professional basketball had acquired a following among American sports fans, who wanted to see the former collegians in action.  That year the Basketball Association of America, with teams from the United States and one from Toronto, began competing in large arenas in the major cities.  Another professional league, the National Basketball League, was already in existence, with many franchises in medium-sized midwestern cities.  The two leagues merged in 1949 as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and pared away the weaker franchises.  With the signing of the country's best collegians through what was called a player draft, the NBA could display both talent and balance.  The NBA's greatest spurt of growth occurred in the 1960s and '70s.  Although the Boston Celtics, led by Bill Russel, Bob Cousy, and John Havlicek and coached by Red Auerbach, won 11 of 13 NBA titles beginning in 1957, fans also closely followed such stars as Philadelphia's Wilt Chamberlain, Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson, and Los Angeles's Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.  The NBA of the 1970s and 1980s exhibited a welcome balance of power: from 1970 until 1988 no team won consecutive NBA titles, though the New York Knicks (with Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, and Bill Bradley) won twice;  the Boston Celtics, 5 times (3 with Larry Bird);  and the Los Angeles Lakers, 6 times (5 with Magic Johnson).  In the 1970s the NBA expanded from 9 teams to 22.  Some of the new franchises were acquired when the American Basketball Association (1968-76) merged with the NBA.  Also, a Dallas franchise was added in 1980;  Charlotte, Carolina, and Miami, in 1988;  and Minnesota and Orlando, in 1989.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s several women's professional leagues were begun;  all of them failed financially.  Women in the USA are currently under the WNBA.  The NBA today enjoys a massive worldwide following, and European basketball is fast emerging.  to challenge the domination of the Americans.  Watch this space...!"

        "text":"Hi, I'm Peter and welcome to TransLegal's lesson of the week.\r\n\r\n Today I'm going to be talking about infer versus imply.\r\n\r\n The verbs infer and imply are often confused.  The important distinction is when a writer or a speaker implies something it means that it's indicated or suggested without being explicitly, expressly or clearly stated.  In other words, it's indirect.\r\n\r\n For example,\r\n\r\n\"Are you implying that my client is dishonest?\"  or\r\n \"The text implies that each house must take its decisions by majority vote\".\r\n\r\n Conversely, a reader or listener infers or you can also say draws an inference, by drawing conclusions based on evidence or logical reasoning rather than from express statements or explicit statements.  So some examples of the use of infer are:\r\n\r\n\"What did the question infer?\"  and\r\n \"One cannot directly infer one from the other\".\r\n\r\n A synonym that you can use or a synonymous phrase which you can use when referring to infer is to “read between the lines”.\r\n\r\n You can learn more about both of these terms in TransLegal's dictionary.  There you will find other sample sentences and common mistakes as well. \r\n\r\n That's it for today though.  If you have any questions or comments, as usual, please leave them in the comment box below and myself or one of my colleagues will get back to you as soon as we can.  Thanks."

        "text":"I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder: schizophrenia.  And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand, why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true?  What is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion?\r\n\r\n So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses.  And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.  And in the lab, we were asking the question, \"What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?\"\r\n\r\n So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities of those chemicals?  So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day.  But then in the evenings and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness.  But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.  A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain.  And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information.  On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read, write or recall any of my life.  I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.\r\n\r\n If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.  And I have brought for you a real human brain.  So this is a real human brain.\r\n\r\n This is the front of the brain, the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.  And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another.  For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor.  The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus collosum, which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.  But other than that, the two hemispheres are completely separate.  Because they process information differently, each of our hemispheres think about different things, they care about different things, and, dare I say, they have very different personalities.\r\n\r\n Excuse me.  Thank you.  It's been a joy.  Assistant: It has been.\r\n\r\n Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.  It's all about \"right here, right now.\"  Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.  Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like.  I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere.  We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family.  And right here, right now, we are brothers and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place.  And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.\r\n\r\n My left hemisphere — our left hemisphere — is a very different place.  Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.  Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future.  Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, details and more details about those details.  It then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities.  And our left hemisphere thinks in language.  It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world.  It's that little voice that says to me, \"Hey, you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home.  I need them in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry.  But perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me, \"I am.  I am.\"  And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me \"I am,\" I become separate.  I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you.  And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.\r\n\r\n On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.  And it was the kind of pain — caustic pain — that you get when you bite into ice cream.  And it just gripped me — and then it released me.  And then it just gripped me — and then it released me.  And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, \"OK, I'll just start my normal routine.\"\r\n\r\n So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body, full-exercise machine.  And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar.  And I thought, \"That's very peculiar.\"  And I looked down at my body and I thought, \"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing.\"  And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience.\r\n\r\n And it was all very peculiar, and my headache was just getting worse.  So I get off the machine, and I'm walking across my living room floor, and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down.  And every step is very rigid and very deliberate.  There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction in my area of perceptions, so I'm just focused on internal systems.  And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body.  I heard a little voice saying, \"OK.  You muscles, you gotta contract.  You muscles, you relax.\"\r\n\r\n And then I lost my balance, and I'm propped up against the wall.  And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body.  I can't define where I begin and where I end, because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.  And all I could detect was this energy — energy.\r\n\r\n And I'm asking myself, \"What is wrong with me?  What is going on?\"  And in that moment, my brain chatter — my left hemisphere brain chatter — went totally silent.  Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button.  Total silence.  And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind.  But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me.  And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive.  I felt at one with all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there.\r\n\r\n Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online, and it says to me, \"Hey!  We got a problem!  We got a problem!  We gotta get some help.\"  And I'm going, \"Ahh!  I got a problem.  I got a problem.\"  So it's like, \"OK.  OK.  I got a problem.\"\r\n\r\n But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness — and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land.  But it was beautiful there.  Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world.\r\n\r\n So here I am in this space, and my job — and any stress related to my job — it was gone.  And I felt lighter in my body.  And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those — they were gone.  And I felt this sense of peacefulness.  And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage!  (Laughter) Oh!  I felt euphoria — euphoria.  It was beautiful.\r\n\r\n And then, again, my left hemisphere comes online and it says, \"Hey!  You've got to pay attention.  We've got to get help.\"  And I'm thinking, \"I got to get help.  I gotta focus.\"  So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking, \"I gotta get to work.  I gotta get to work.  Can I drive?  Can I drive?\"\r\n\r\n And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.  Then I realized, \"Oh my gosh!  I'm having a stroke!  I'm having a stroke!\"\r\n\r\n And the next thing my brain says to me is, \"Wow!  This is so cool.\"  (Laughter) \"This is so cool!  How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out?\"  (Laughter)\r\n\r\n And then it crosses my mind, \"But I'm a very busy woman!\"  (Laughter) \"I don't have time for a stroke!\"\r\n\r\n So I'm like, \"OK, I can't stop the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two, and then I'll get back to my routine.  OK.  So I gotta call help.  I gotta call work.\"  I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office I had a business card with my number on it.  So I go into my business room, I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards.  And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels.  And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols, and I just couldn't tell.  And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.  And in that moment, I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card ... that's not the card ... that's not the card.  It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.  In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.  I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have.  So I take the phone pad and I put it right here.  I take the business card, I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.  But then I would drift back out into La La Land, and not remember when I came back if I'd already dialed those numbers.  So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, \"Yes, I've already dialed that number.\"\r\n\r\n Eventually, the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me, \"Woo woo woo woo.\"  (Laughter) And I think to myself, \"Oh my gosh, he sounds like a Golden Retriever!\"\r\n\r\n And so I say to him — clear in my mind, I say to him: \"This is Jill!  I need help!\"  And what comes out of my voice is, \"Woo woo woo woo woo.\"  I'm thinking, \"Oh my gosh, I sound like a Golden Retriever.\"  So I couldn't know — I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.  So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help.\r\n\r\n And a little while later, I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.  And I curl up into a little fetal ball.  And just like a balloon with the last bit of air, just, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift and just — I felt my spirit surrender.\r\n\r\n And in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life.  And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition.\r\n\r\n When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover that I was still alive.  When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life.  And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality.  Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain.  Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape.  Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle.  And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.  Nirvana.  I found Nirvana.  And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body.\r\n\r\n But then I realized, \"But I'm still alive!  I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.  And if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana.\"  And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time.  And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace.  And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives.  And it motivated me to recover.\r\n\r\n Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage, the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers.  Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life.  It took me eight years to completely recover.\r\n\r\n So who are we?  We are the life-force power of the universe, with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds.  And we have the power to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. "

        "text":"He will not show any embarrassment, even though he is acutely aware that this will definitely fuel the ridiculous rumors of the \"romance\" between him and Kirk.  Being creatures driven by their emotions, the humans are no doubt taking this as yet another sign of his nonexistent \"affections\" for Kirk.\r\n\r\n Perhaps he should have chosen Nyota, Spock thinks, coming to a halt before the entrance to the tent.  He stares at it resolutely as Mr. Santon continues, \"…Captain Kirk, please take your place.  The moment Commander Spock steps inside, the spell connecting you with him will activate.  I must warn you that it will most likely take some effort to keep the link stable and communicate through it, so it will require a great concentration from you, since your champion will be rather preoccupied.\"\r\n\r\n Spock doesn't look at Kirk, or to the stands, simply waiting for the signal to enter the tent.  When he finally receives it, he is relieved to leave the looks and whispers behind.\r\n\r\n The moment he steps inside, the world goes completely black, the noise of the crowd cutting off abruptly.\r\n\r\n While Spock cannot say that he has not expected this, what he did not expect is how completely quiet it would be.  He cannot hear even his own breathing  —  he cannot hear anything at all, and for his sensitive ears, it is something of a shock.  He is used to hearing things he does not wish to hear, and not being able to hear even the faintest whisper is far more disconcerting than the lack of vision.  He has received extensive training in a Vulcan martial art shivaksu  —  the art of fighting with closed eyes  —  but it heavily relies on one's hearing and is almost useless now.\r\n\r\n Gripping the dagger hard, Spock thinks of the creature in the tent with him.  For all he knows, it might be only a few feet away.\r\n\r\n He will not see it attack.  He will not hear its footsteps or noise.\r\n\r\n He cannot do anything.\r\n\r\n With a sinking feeling, he realizes that he is completely in Kirk's mercy  —  Kirk, who is supposed to assist him, but is conspicuously silent.\r\n\r\n Suddenly, there is a subtle movement of the air next to his face.  On pure instinct, Spock rolls aside and waits, breathing hard.  Waits, straining his ears, despite knowing that it's futile.\r\n\r\n Another movement of the air, and then a sharp pain explodes in his wrist, making him drop the dagger, and a smell of burnt flesh touches his nostrils.  Hissing in pain, Spock throws his left fist toward where he thinks his attacker is, but it meets only air.  Leaning down, he frantically attempts to find the dropped dagger, but is interrupted as another fireball hits arm, forcing him to abandon the task to get his burning shirt off.  When he does, he leans down again and returns to blindly searching for the dagger  —  without it, he know he is utterly helpless.\r\n\r\n He exhales in relief as his hand closes around the hilt.  Straightening, Spock grips the dagger in his hand, feeling the levels of adrenaline in his blood increase drastically as he waits for the creature's next move.  He has no other option: attempting to run and evade would be pointless because he does not know where the creature is and has no means of learning its location.\r\n\r\n Spock thinks of Kirk and clenches his jaw.  It would not be logical to put a blinded and deafened champion in a room with a dangerous creature without any assistance.  There are only two options: either something went wrong with the spell, or…\r\n\r\n Or Kirk simply does not wish to assist him.\r\n\r\n 'Don't be silly, sweetheart,' his mother's soft voice suddenly sounds in his head as a memory flashes though his mind: of Amanda chiding his three-year-old self for not informing her that he had hurt his knee.\r\n\r\n Bewildered, Spock ponders why he recalled that old memory when it is neither the time nor the place, when another memory flashes through his mind: 'Move, move, move!'  Kirk is shouting, urging the away team to run from the huge reptiles that appeared unexpectedly when they beamed down on Zixu II.\r\n\r\n That memory makes Spock even more confused.  Before he can think of what it might mean, a sharp pain hits his left shoulder.  Touching the injured flesh, he quickly examines the damage manually and concludes that he has received another burn.  Without waiting to be hit again, Spock moves to the left and rolls aside, hissing through his gritted teeth as his injured shoulder makes itself known.\r\n\r\n 'Excuse me, could you tell me where Astrophysics labs are?'  a female cadet asks him.\r\n 'To your right, Cadet,' Spock replies.  This is how he meets Nyota.\r\n\r\n Understanding dawning upon him, Spock swings his fist to his right side.  He hits something, but, because he cannot see or hear, he cannot tell how much damage he caused.\r\n\r\n 'So good,' Kirk pants out under him, mouth slack with pleasure.  'More.'\r\n\r\n Ignoring the spike of arousal, Spock hits the same spot again, so hard that it makes his hand ache  —  something that, due to his Vulcan physiology, does not occur easily  —  but, before he can use the dagger, the creature is not there any longer.\r\n\r\n How badly is it hurt?  he thinks intently, hoping that Kirk can hear him  —  that is, if he is correct and it's indeed Kirk who is attempting to guide him using his memories.  It makes him more than a little uncomfortable that Kirk might have access to his memories, but since there is nothing he can do about it at the moment, he does his best to ignore his discomfort, focusing on the task at hand.\r\n\r\n 'Nothing life-threatening,' McCoy says, scowling at his tricorder.  'Just a few bad bruises here and there.  You'll live.'\r\n\r\n Somewhat disappointed but not at all surprised, Spock tentatively steps ahead.  Where is the creature, Kirk?\r\n\r\n He is aware that the question is not easy to answer using such an inadequate method of communication, but he trusts Kirk to find the way to tell him, even though Spock does not know the extent of Kirk's access to his memories and prefers not to think of how far it might stretch.\r\n\r\n But when another memory flashes through his mind, Spock’s eyes widen.  No.  Kirk cannot see that memory.\r\n\r\n '  —  look at his Human eyes.  I think he is going to cry.'  Skonn’s face stays mostly blank, his sneer barely noticeable.\r\n\r\n 'I believe you are correct,' Sereek says, lifting the hand with Spock's PADD  —  the PADD that was specially-made for Spock by his mother.  'Do you think he has tear ducts?  I hope he does.  I have never seen anyone cry.  It should be interesting.'\r\n\r\n 'Return my property immediately,' Spock says evenly, clenching his small fists behind his back.  He becomes aware that his lower lip is trembling and clenches his jaw shut.  The other boys are much bigger and older than him  —  Spock is six  —  and he calculates that the odds of him overpowering them and getting his PADD back are approximately 0.7 percent.\r\n\r\n He does not know how to proceed.\r\n\r\n 'Of course,' Sereek says and puts the PADD on the floor.  He exchanges a look with Skonn before looking back at Spock.  'You may take it back – Human.'\r\n\r\n Spock looks at him suspiciously, then looks at the PADD lying on the floor.  He does not trust the boy, but if he returns home without it, his mother will ask uncomfortable questions that Spock has no desire to answer.\r\n\r\n Slowly, he approaches the bigger boy, but Sereek makes no threatening move.  Somewhat relaxing, Spock bends down to pick up the PADD and cries out as Sereek lifts his leg and smashes the PADD and the tips of Spock's fingers, causing a sharp pain explode through his sensitive hand.\r\n\r\n 'Is he crying?'  Skonn inquires.\r\n\r\n His face burns with humiliation, but Spock forces himself to move;  he has no time to dwell on the matter.  He knows where the creature is, and right now, it is the only thing that matters.\r\n\r\n He moves toward the creature  —  toward his PADD  —  and there it is.  Grunting as they collide, Spock sinks the dagger into its flesh.  He cannot hear the sound the creature makes, but he can feel it shudder and convulse.\r\n\r\n The next moment, overwhelming noise and light hits his senses, and he finds himself standing in the tent with a corpse lying at his feet.  He stares at the creature, at its dark-red skin and dead black eyes, its mouth twisted in a snarl and the dagger lodged into its chest and  —  \r\n\r\n \"Commander Spock has successfully completed the second task,\" the commentator is saying, and the crowd's noises increase.  Spock stands there for a few moments, having no desire to leave the tent and face Kirk.  His stomach twists as he thinks of the shameful memory.\r\n\r\n However, he knows he cannot stay here forever.  He exits the tent, holding his head high.\r\n\r\n Those in the stands are cheering, but he ignores them and walks to the stand where the judges are seated, and after receiving his points  —  only 47 out of the 60, which is probably due to the numerous burns he received before killing the creature  —  and allowing the Atenian healer to attend to him, he leaves for the castle, not interested in other champions' results.\r\n\r\n He pretends that he cannot see Kirk's stare.\r\n\r\n ~*~\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Spock!  Dammit, Spock, wait up!\"\r\n\r\n Spock does not slow his stride to his quarters.  He can hear Kirk jogging behind him and can see people in the corridor turning their heads.  It takes considerable effort to keep his face blank and ignore the blatant staring.\r\n\r\n Kirk grabs his arm, but Spock does not look at him.  \"Dammit, have you gone deaf permanently or something?\"\r\n\r\n \"What do you wish, Captain?  And please remove your hand from my arm,\" Spock says, not slowing his steps.\r\n\r\n Tightening his hold, Kirk practically jumps before him, blocking his way.  Spock looks at him coolly.  \"What do you wish?\"\r\n\r\n For a few moments, Kirk eyes him intently before something resembling understanding crosses his expressive face.  He sighs.  \"Is that about what I saw?\"  Before Spock can reply, Kirk says with another sigh, \"Look, it's not like I was trying to pry or anything.  It's not my fault that Atenians' idea of communicating involved me using your memories.  I didn't even try to be nosy, okay?  I just thought of what I wanted to say to you, and the memories turned up.  It's not like I intentionally looked for them or anything.\"\r\n\r\n Spock forces himself to relax his jaw.  \"Move away.  Captain.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk crosses his arms over his chest and cocks his head arrogantly.  \"No.\"\r\n\r\n Looking at him, Spock experiences oddest sensation;  he believes humans call it déjà-vu.  This is exactly how Kirk looked when he argued Spock's decision to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet instead of chasing the Narada to Earth. "

On sports days at school boys and girls run races, and even train for them.  There is usually a mile race for older boys, and one who wins it is certainly a good runner.  Usually those who run a race go as fast as possible, but there are some races in which everybody has to go very carefully in order to avoid falling.  The most famous boat-race in England is between Oxford and Cambridge.  It is rowed over a course on the River Thames, and thousands of people go to watch it.  The eight rowers in each boat have great struggle, and at the end there is usually only a short distance between the winners and the losers.  The University boat-race started in 1820 and has been rowed on the Thames almost every spring since 1836."

        "text":"Transcript\r\n Hello, welcome to TransLegal's lesson of the week.\r\n\r\n My name is Robin and today we're going to talk about the soundalike words accede and exceed.\r\n\r\n As you hear, these two words should not really be pronounced exactly the same, you must very carefully emphasise the vowel in the first syllable accede and exceed but when we speak quickly and when we are not so careful they sound alike so it's quite important to recognise the various contexts which make clear the distinctions between these words.\r\n\r\n Now accede means to adhere to an agreement or to become party to a treaty or a contract.  Whereas exceed means to go beyond or surpass.\r\n\r\n The meanings have no correlation, they are completely different.  So that makes it particularly easy to understand which one we're looking for.\r\n\r\n For instance, this first one, accede, we would hear it in a sentence like\r\n\r\n \"The European Union supported Russia's application to accede to the World Trade Organisation.\" ;  or\r\n\r\n \"They were able to settle the case when the defendant acceded to the plaintiff's demand\".\r\n\r\n Then we have the word exceed.  This we maybe hear more often in a non-legal context.  For instance:\r\n\r\n\"I got a speeding ticket when I was exceeding the speed limit while driving.\" ;  or\r\n\r\n a company might say “Spending far exceeded their revenues and that caused a deficit.”\r\n\r\n We can also use exceed in a positive way.  For instance, you can say:\r\n\r\n“Her performance exceeded their expectations.”\r\n\r\n Now both of these words have related nouns.  For instance, for accede, we have accession.  For instance you would say:\r\n\r\n“The senate recommended accession to the treaty.”\r\n\r\n And for excess, we would always say in excess of.  So you could say:\r\n\r\n\"The company recommended that her bonus be in excess of one million dollars.”\r\n\r\n And now I'm afraid that I might have exceeded my time limit.  So I'm going to accede to my director's suggestion and finish right now. \r\n\r\n Thank you for listening and we look forward to seeing your comments.  Bye for now."

It is most… unsettling.\r\n\r\n \"Move away,\" Spock repeats, very evenly.  \"We are attracting attention.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk lets out a chuckle, but there is no humor in his eyes.  \"Like that's something new.\"  He brushes a hand through his hair exasperatedly.  \"For fuck's sake, Spock  —   What exactly has got you so worked up?  So I saw some Vulcan bullies taking your things from you and refusing to give them back, so what?  Is it the pride thing or something?  If it is, you're being ridiculous, because shit like that happens to every other kid out there.  Kids are cruel  —  and apparently Vulcans kids are just as cruel as humans.  The fact that you were bullied when you a kid by older kids doesn't make you weak or something.  It's nothing to be ashamed of.\"\r\n\r\n Spock knows Kirk is correct.\r\n\r\n He is perfectly aware of that.\r\n\r\n However, it does not change the fact that he cannot stand the mere thought of appearing weak  —  anything less than perfect  —  before Kirk.  It is highly illogical, but it is true nevertheless.\r\n\r\n \"Unhand me,\" he tells Kirk.  \"I do not wish to continue this conver  —  \"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, for  —  \" Kirk lets out with a sigh before pulling him closer by the shirt and kissing him.\r\n\r\n Spock freezes for a second, but the next moment, he finds himself wrapping his arms around Kirk's waist and kissing him back.  The lips against his own are very soft and plush, and Spock cannot stop kissing them, inhaling Kirk's scent.  He is dimly aware that people must still be watching, but Kirk feels so good in his arms that he cannot make himself pull away, feeling the stress, the humiliation, the confusion fade away and a warm, tingling pleasure flow through his body instead.\r\n\r\n It is the oddest kiss they have shared, and part of him is greatly disturbed by its gentleness and by how little he cares that they are in public.  Mmm.  Spock pulls Kirk tighter to himself and deepens the kiss, unable to get enough.  Burying his fingers in Spock's hair, Kirk sighs softly into his mouth and sucks on his tongue, causing his arousal to heighten.\r\n\r\n Someone giggles loudly, and Kirk breaks the kiss, breathing hard.  He is flushed, his blue eyes are glazed, and his swollen lips are very… pleasing.  Unable to help himself, Spock leans in for another kiss, but Kirk puts a finger against Spock's lips and shakes his head.  \"Not here,\" he says quietly, voice hoarse, and, glancing around, blushes even harder.  He smiles crookedly.  \"Shit, the crew is gawking at us.  We're on a shore-leave, and it isn't exactly against the rules, but still.\"\r\n\r\n Taking a deep breath, Spock looks around, and there are indeed quite a large number of the Enterprise crewmembers 'happening' to be passing through this particular corridor.  He becomes rather disconcerted when he realizes that the crewmembers are not averting their gazes the moment his eyes meet theirs, as they used to;  they do not appear to be scared of him  —  there are only elements of confusion, sharp curiosity, and varied degrees of shock on their faces.  Some of them are smiling.\r\n\r\n Unsettled, Spock looks back to Kirk's flushed face and feels… something.\r\n\r\n \"You are correct,\" Spock says, stroking his fingers through Kirk's short hair.  His hand freezes when he realizes what he is doing.  Quickly clasping his hands behind his back, Spock clears his throat slightly.  \"I am retiring to my quarters.\"\r\n\r\n Kirk's smile fades, his expression becoming speculative and serious as he regards Spock.  \"Is that an invitation?\"\r\n\r\n \"No. "

There are many, many different accounting conventions so I will just highlight a few.\r\n\r\n For example, the historic cost convention, which means that the value of an item is determined based on the cost of acquisition at the time of acquisition.  Another convention is the going concern convention, which assumes that at the time of preparing the accounts the company intends to continue in business.  A third example is the prudence convention, which means that you try to take as fair or as accurate a sum or an estimate of the cost of various assets.  In other words, you err on the side of caution.  Fourth, is the money measurement convention – the money measurement convention is concerned with only using those items which can be quantified so, for example, employee morale is not shown on the accounts, nor is the value of the location of the plant shown in the accounts.  However, it should be noted that accounting is a living science so to say, so what can and cannot be measured according to the money measurement convention can change over time.\r\n\r\n Thank you very much.

His first experiments Involved standing on his surfboard holding out a piece of sail cloth in his hands.  Gradually he and Drake refined this idea into a basic design for a sailboard, similar to a surfboard, but holding a mast and a triangular sail which could be tilted and turned in any direction.  The windsurfer operates a boom which controls the amount of wind in the sail, for speed and change of direction.  Schweitzer immediately went into business designing and making the new sailboards and taking the idea abroad.  By mid-seventies, the sport had spread to Holland, Germany and France."
