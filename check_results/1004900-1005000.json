He is showing mercy to Society.  Go, now;  I will not hear you.\"\r\n\r\n In vain Margaret knocked, begged, pleaded, and sobbed.\r\n\r\n At last, in a fit of desperation, as she saw the sun sinking lower and the precious minutes flying, she hurled her magnificent figure against the door and smashed the cheap lock which held it.\r\n\r\n The old man sat at the other side of the room, looking out of the window, with his massive jaws locked in rage.  The girl staggered to his side, knelt by his chair, placed her trembling hand on his arm, and begged:\r\n\r\n    \"For the love of Jesus, have mercy!  Come with me quickly!\"\r\n\r\n With a growl of anger, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"No!\"\r\n\r\n Page 367\r\n \"It was a mad impulse, in my defense as well as his own.\"\r\n\r\n \"Impulse, yes!  But back of it lay banked the fires of cruelty and race hatred!  The Nation can not live with such barbarism rotting its heart out.\"\r\n\r\n \"But this is war, sir, —  a war of races, and this an accident of war —  besides, his life had been attempted by them twice before.\"\r\n\r\n \"So I've heard, and yet the Negro always happens to be the victim — \"\r\n\r\n Margaret leaped to her feet and glared at the old man for a moment in uncontrollable anger.\r\n\r\n \"Are you a fiend?\"  she fairly shrieked.\r\n\r\n Old Stoneman merely pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n The girl came a step closer, and extended her hand again in mute appeal.\r\n\r\n \"No, I was foolish.  You are not cruel.  I have heard of a hundred acts of charity you have done among our poor.  Come, this is horrible!  It is impossible!  You can not consent to the death of your son — \"\r\n\r\n Stoneman looked up sharply:\r\n\r\n    \"Thank God, he hasn't married my daughter yet — \"\r\n\r\n \"Your daughter!\"  gasped Margaret.  \"I've told you it was Phil who killed the negro!  He took Ben's place just before the guards were exchanged — \"\r\n\r\n \"Phil!  — Phil?\"  shrieked the old man, staggering to his club foot and stumbling toward Margaret with dilated eyes and whitening face;  \"My boy — Phil?  — why — why, are you crazy?  — Phil?  Did you say — Phil?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.  Ben persuaded him to go to Charlotte until\r\n\r\n Page 368\r\n the excitement passed to avoid trouble.  — Come, come, sir, we must be quick!  We may be too late!\"\r\n\r\n She seized and pulled him toward the door.\r\n\r\n \"Yes.  Yes, we must hurry,\" he said in a laboured whisper, looking around dazed.  \"You will show me the way, my child — you love him — yes, we will go quickly —  quickly!  my boy — my boy!\"\r\n\r\n Margaret called the landlord, and while they hitched Queen to the buggy, the old man stood helplessly wringing and fumbling his big ugly hands, muttering incoherently, and tugging at his collar as though about to suffocate.\r\n\r\n As they dashed away, old Stoneman laid a trembling hand on Margaret's arm.\r\n\r\n \"Your horse is a good one, my child?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  the one Marion saved-the finest in the county.\"\r\n\r\n \"And you know the way?\"\r\n\r\n \"Every foot of it.  Phil and I have driven it often.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, yes — you love him,\" he sighed, pressing her hand.\r\n\r\n Through the long reckless drive, as the mare flew over the rough hills, every nerve and muscle of her fine body at its utmost tension, the father sat silent.  He braced his club foot against the iron bar of the dashboard and gripped the sides of the buggy to steady his feeble body.  Margaret leaned forward intently watching the road to avoid an accident.  The old man's strange colourless eyes stared straight in front, wide open, and seeing nothing, as if the soul had already fled through them into eternity.\r\n\r\n Page 369\r\n CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n 'VENGEANCE IS MINE'\r\n\r\n IT was dark long before Margaret and Stoneman reached Piedmont.  A mile out of town a horse neighed in the woods, and, tired as she was, Queen threw her head high and answered the call.\r\n\r\n The old man did not notice it, but Margaret knew a squadron of white-and-scarlet horsemen stood in those woods, and her heart gave a bound of Joy.\r\n\r\n As they passed the Presbyterian church, she saw through the open window her father standing at his Elder's seat leading in prayer.  They were holding a watch service, asking God for victory in the eventful struggle of the day.\r\n\r\n Margaret attempted to drive straight to the jail, and a sentinel stopped them.\r\n\r\n \"I am Stoneman, sir — the real commander of these troops,\" said the old man, with authority.\r\n\r\n \"Orders is orders, and I don't take 'em from you,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n \"Then tell your commander that Mr. Stoneman has just arrived from Spartanburg and asks to see him at the hotel immediately.\"\r\n\r\n He hobbled into the parlour and waited in agony while\r\n\r\n Page 370\r\n Margaret tied the mare.  Ben, her mother and father, and every servant were gone.\r\n\r\n In a few moments the second officer hurried to Stoneman, saluted, and said:\r\n\r\n    \"We've pulled it off in good shape, sir.  They've tried to fool us with a dozen tricks, and a whole regiment has been lying in wait for us all day.  But at dark the Captain outwitted them, took his prisoner with a squad of picked cavalry, and escaped their pickets.  They've been gone an hour, and ought to be back with the body — \"\r\n\r\n Old Stoneman sprang on him with the sudden fury of a madman, clutching at his throat.\r\n\r\n \"If you've killed my son,\" he gasped — \"go — go!  Follow them with a swift messenger and stop them!  It's a mistake — you're killing the wrong man — you're killing my boy — quick — my God, quick — don't stand there staring at me!\"\r\n\r\n The officer rushed to obey his order, as Margaret entered.\r\n\r\n The old man seized her arm, and said with laboured breath:\r\n\r\n    \"Your father, my child, ask him to come to me quickly.\"  Margaret hurried to the church, and an usher called the doctor to the door.\r\n\r\n He read the question trembling on the girl's lips.\r\n\r\n \"Nothing has happened yet, my daughter.  Your brother has held a regiment of his men in readiness every moment of the day.\"\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Stoneman is at the hotel and asks to see you immediately,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n Page 371\r\n \"God grant he may prevent bloodshed,\" said the father.  \"Go inside and stay with your mother.\"\r\n\r\n When Doctor Cameron entered the parlour, Stoneman hobbled painfully to meet him, his face ashen, and his breath rattling in his throat as if his soul were being strangled.\r\n\r\n \"You are my enemy, Doctor,\" he said, taking his hand, \"but you are a pious man.  I have been called an infidel- I am only a wilful sinner-I have slain my own son, unless God Almighty, who can raise the dead, shall save him!  You are the man at whom I aimed the blow that has fallen on my head.  I wish to confess to you and set myself right before God.  He may hear my cry, and have mercy on me.\"\r\n\r\n He gasped for breath, sank into his seat, looked around, and said:\r\n\r\n    \"Will you close the door?\"\r\n\r\n The doctor complied with his request and returned.\r\n\r\n \"We all wear masks, Doctor,\" began the trembling voice.  \"Beneath lie the secrets of love and hate from which actions move.  My will alone forged the chains of Negro rule.  Three forces moved me — party success, a vicious woman, and the quenchless desire for personal vengeance.  When I first fell a victim to the wiles of the yellow vampire who kept my house, I dreamed of lifting her to my level.  And when I felt myself sinking into the black abyss of animalism, I, whose soul had learned the pathway of the stars and held high converse with the great spirits of the ages — \"\r\n\r\n He paused, looked up in terror, and whispered:\r\n\r\nPage 372\r\n \"What's that noise?  Isn't it the distant beat of horses?\"\r\n\r\n \"No,\" said the doctor, listening;  \"it's the roar of the falls we hear, from a sudden change of the wind.\"\r\n\r\n I'm done now,\" Stoneman went on, slowly, fumbling his hands.  \"My life has been a failure.  The dice of God are always loaded.\"\r\n\r\n His great head drooped lower, and he continued:\r\n\r\n    Mightiest of all was my motive of revenge.  Fierce business and political feuds wrecked my iron-mills I shouldered their vast debts, and paid the last mortgage of a hundred thousand dollars the week before Lee invaded my state.  I stood on the hill in the darkness, cried, raved cursed, while I watched his troops lay those mills in ashes.  Then and there I swore that I'd live until I ground the South beneath my heel!  When I got back to my house, they had buried a Confederate soldier in the field.  I dug his body up, carted it to the woods, and threw it into a ditch — \"\r\n\r\n The hand of the white-haired Southerner suddenly gripped old Stoneman's throat-and then relaxed.  His head sank on his breast, and he cried in anguish:\r\n\r\n    \"God be merciful to me a sinner!  Would I, too, seek revenge!\"\r\n\r\n Stoneman looked at the doctor, dazed by his sudden onslaught and collapse.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, he was somebody's boy down here,\" he went on, who was loved perhaps even as I love — I don't blame you.  See, in the inside pocket next to my heart I carry the pictures of Phil and Elsie taken from babyhood up,\r\n\r\nPage 373\r\n all set in a little book.  They don't know this-nor does the world dream I've been so soft-hearted —  \"\r\n\r\n He drew a miniature album from his pocket and fumbled it aimlessly:\r\n\r\n    \"You know Phil was my first-born — \"\r\n\r\n His voice broke, and he looked at the doctor helplessly.\r\n\r\n The Southerner slipped his arm around the old man' s shoulders and began a tender and reverent prayer.\r\n\r\n The sudden thunder of a squad of cavalry with clanking sabres swept by the hotel toward the jail.\r\n\r\n Stoneman scrambled to his feet, staggered, and caught a chair.\r\n\r\n \"It's no use,\" he groaned, \" — they've come with his body — I'm skipping down — the lights are going out — I haven't a friend!  It's dark and cold — I'm alone, and lost — God — has — hidden — His — face — from — me!\"\r\n\r\n Voices were heard without, and the tramp of heavy feet on the steps.\r\n\r\n Stoneman clutched the doctor's arm in agony:\r\n\r\n    \"Stop them!  — Stop them!  Don't let them bring him in here!\"\r\n\r\n He sank limp into the chair and stared at the door as it swung open and Phil walked in, with Ben and Elsie by his side in full clansman disguise.\r\n\r\n The old man leaped to his feet and gasped:\r\n\r\n    \"The Klan!  — The Klan!  No?  Yes!  It's true — glory to God, they've saved my boy!  — Phil — Phil!\"\r\n\r\n \"How did you rescue him?\"  Doctor Cameron asked Ben.\r\n\r\n \"Had a squadron lying in wait on every road that led\r\n\r\n Page 374\r\n from town.  The Captain thought a thousand men were on him, and surrendered without a shot.\"\r\n\r\n At twelve o'clock, Ben stood at the gate with Elsie.\r\n\r\n \"Your fate hangs in the balance of this election tonight,\" she said.  \"I'll share it with you, success or failure, life or death.\"\r\n\r\n \"Success, not failure,\" he answered, firmly.  \"The Grand Dragons of six states have already wired victory.  Look at our lights on the mountains!  They are ablaze  — range on range our signals gleam until the Fiery Cross is lost among the stars!\"\r\n\r\n \"What does it mean?\"  she whispered.\r\n\r\n \"That I am a successful revolutionist — that Civilisation has been saved, and the South redeemed from shame.\"\r\n\r\n THE END"

        "text":"Since launching in the US last year, the campaign with the catchy whistling jingle has been identifi ed as the reason for Coke’s best performance since 1998.  Sales and public awareness are up due to the spot’s popularity on online peer-to-peer content sharing websites.  In Singapore, the brand grew 6% on its Coke and Coke Lite brands and 4% on Coke Lite alone, its strongest performance in the last eight years.  Such has been the popularity of the campaign that the Coca-Cola team has made it a point to drive all business points back to the campaign – even on their business cards.\r\n\r\n “We did the roll-out of the Coke side of life with our employees – they all got to blog a week before the ad was fi nally revealed to them.  All our business cards have been modifi ed to have ‘Coke side of life’ visuals so everything would be centered around it,” Shakir Moin, regional manager of Singapore and Malaysia for F&N Coca-Cola Far East said.\r\n\r\n “We have POS materials which leverage all the characters of ‘Happiness factory’, and 10 million Coca-Cola products will carry these visuals in their packaging which are being distributed out into the market.  We have rebranded our website so the internet messages are going to be around the same theme,” Moin said.\r\n\r\n Coke’s US creative agency Wieden + Kennedy worked with production house Psyop to create the computer-generated graphics ad, which features a view inside a Coca-Cola vending machine and details the process through which a bottle of Coke is manufactured right up to the point it is delivered to the exit door of the vending machine.\r\n\r\n The local launch of the campaign saw elements unique to Singapore being implemented – the Coke brand team worked with media agency Mediaedge:cia to create a teaser print ad which hinted that the brand would soon reveal the carbonated drink’s secret ingredient – this was then revealed to be ‘happiness’.\r\n\r\n While there were other spots within the campaign released in the US, the local Coca-Cola team decided it would be strategic to only release ‘Happiness factory’ in Singapore as it carried more relevance.  “The strategy is that when you focus your communication on one singular idea, messages become a lot more powerful and the message works much better versus multiple executions,” Moin said.\r\n\r\n There are plans however, to launch the other spots here in the future – one of which may be ‘Ringtone’, which has performed well in initial market tests with consumers.\r\n\r\n The ‘Happiness factory’ spot is supported by an integrated campaign which includes digital components such as an online campaign and promotions, as well as OOH and print executions – the campaign has launched in 65 countries, with Coca-Cola hoping to add over 100 countries more.\r\n\r\n – Clairice Chiam\r\n\r\n Out Box:\r\n\r\nTHINGS YOU PROBABLY DIDN’T KNOW\r\n\r\n 1 In and of itself the word ‘Happiness factory’ is an oxymoron as factories, by deﬁ nition, are boring things.\r\n\r\n 2 The creators of the campaign learned from comic books which sort of characters work and which do not, and realised that the simpler the character, the more impactful they are and the more people will connect to them.  As such, many characters do not have or have undeﬁ ned eyes.\r\n\r\n 3 The original idea for the campaign was to set up a real factory with real people working in it.  But the idea of dramatising and bringing each and every element of how a bottle of Coke is produced in a fantasy world to life was a challenge.\r\n\r\n 4 Some characters of the spot include: the Chinoinks - A cross between a Chinook helicopter and a pig, these nipple-ringed characters carry bottles of Coke with their nipples.  The Love Puppies - these are the white fur balls that attach to the bottle of Coke, kissing it.  They don’t have eyes, only large, huge lips.  The Mortar Man – a ﬂ ying worker that looks like a huge plane.\r\n\r\n 5 Up to 17 people worked on the spot – ﬁ ve animators, three technical directors, a texture/lighting specialist, two ﬂ ame artists, two after effects artists, a matte painter, and two to three modelers."

        "text":"Life is supposed to make you happy.  You’re not supposed to wake up every day dreading the hours ahead and dreaming of another life.\r\n\r\n Happiness – in both your personal and professional life – comes down to one thing: YOU.  You’re the common denominator here, so in 2014 perhaps it’s time to start doing things that can make you a happier person, and stop doing the things that are bringing you down.\r\n\r\n Imagine what next year might bring if you…\r\n\r\n START doing these things\r\n\r\n 1.  Forget the drama\r\n\r\n It is so easy to get caught up in the details of all the little things that you forget to see the bigger picture, so don’t make everything such a drama.\r\n\r\n By creating drama we attract attention to ourselves that is negative and all wrong.  This is not a recipe for happiness, only doubt and self-pity.\r\n\r\n 2.  Look only to yourself for approval\r\n\r\n This can be difficult in certain workplace scenarios, but at the end of the day you decide what you’re going to do and how you’re going to do it.  And even when it feels like you don’t have a choice, you do!\r\n\r\n Happiness isn’t something you can achieve by getting approval from other people – it only comes from within.  So think about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, and if you’re not doing it for the right reasons, then stop.\r\n\r\n 3.  Get out of your own way\r\n\r\n Taking control of everything in our lives and maximising what power we do have – that’s what we all want, right?  Well, you need to get out of your own way.\r\n\r\n Self-control is a tricky thing, and whether it’s to do with wanting to drop a few kilos or give up a bad habit at work you’ve got to be able to allow yourself to de-stress and unwind in order to keep things on track.  When it comes to willpower, you’ve got to give yourself breaks in order to achieve your goal.\r\n\r\n I liken it to a diet – when you give yourself ‘cheat days’ you tend to be more successful in sticking to a healthier eating plan for longer.  It’s the same at work – more breaks equals higher productivity.\r\n\r\n STOP doing these things\r\n\r\n 1.  Blaming other people\r\n\r\n We know, we know – your employees aren’t living up to your expectations, right?  Your supplier didn’t deliver the product on time?  You just got so busy doing all this work for other people that you didn’t have time to meet that deadline?\r\n\r\n It’s much easier to blame others for your problems, but it achieves nothing.  Ask yourself why you feel the need to shift the blame elsewhere.  Did you fail in telling your employee how to finish the task properly?  Did you give your supplier a ridiculous and unrealistic deadline to meet?\r\n\r\n True, sometimes other people are to blame – but the happiest people in the world know that the solution to their problems starts with themselves, not others.\r\n\r\n 2.  Feeling sorry for yourself\r\n\r\n Woe is you.  Life is so hard.  There’s never enough money, there’s always too much work to do and everyone is always on your case about everything.\r\n\r\n Well, guess what?  Every single other person, in some way, shape or form, is going through the exact same things as you.  I’m not saying it doesn’t suck sometimes (I know it does) but moaning about it doesn’t help anything at all.\r\n\r\n Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, take responsibility for your actions and outcomes and come to terms with the fact that life is not fair.  It doesn’t owe you anything.  Emerge from this with a more positive attitude and get on with things.\r\n\r\n 3.  Worry about things you have no control over\r\n\r\n I’ll admit I struggle with this a lot, but there really is nothing you can do about bumper-to-bumper traffic, the internet deciding to crap out on you in the middle of doing your work, or lost airport luggage.  It has happened already – move on!\r\n\r\n Happy people know that next time any of the above happen they’ll be prepared by leaving earlier to miss traffic, saving their work elsewhere periodically and packing a few essentials in their carry-on."

        "text":"A lot of people think being happy comes from having more – a bigger house, a nicer car or a new handbag.\r\n\r\n But the happiest people I know aren’t focused on what they don’t have, they’re focused on what they do already have.  They understand work – and life – is a journey and a goal, and because of this they have a unique perspective on everything life throws at them.\r\n\r\n This is what I’ve learned about being happy at work, from the happiest people I know.\r\n\r\n 1.  Try not to take the advice of “follow your passion” too literally\r\n\r\n It’s not that it’s bad advice, it’s just that it’s not that great either.  “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life” is the mentality this well-meaning instruction pushes, but tell me – when has chasing your passion been a simple quick fix to a happy work life?\r\n\r\n Of course, you should forge a career in something that makes you happy, but passions change – they are not sustainable.  Concentrate on building a sustainable career, rather than one that makes you happy right this second.\r\n\r\n 2.  Work for a company that supports your priorities outside of work\r\n\r\n I can’t recommend this enough, because it’s near impossible to be happy at work if you’re not given the freedom and flexibility to enjoy everything else about life outside the office.\r\n\r\n Yes, everyone talks about work-life balance, but it’s for a good reason.  Too many people feel overwhelmed by work, and too many people lead unhealthy, unfulfilled lives because of it.  Don’t be one of those people.  Work towards finding an employer who understands the importance of your life outside the office.\r\n\r\n 3.  Challenge yourself because it gives you an excellent perspective\r\n\r\n Let’s be honest, doing the same thing day in and day out is tedious and boring.  But a challenge, when it comes your way, is new and exciting – even if at first it appears a little bit scary.\r\n\r\n I have found out a lot about myself through the various challenges I’ve faced in life, whether at work or in my broader life.  The way we deal with challenges can dictate how happy we will be, and those who recognise this are more enabled to find meaning in what they do.\r\n\r\n Don’t ever turn down a challenge because it seems daunting.  Accept it, try your hardest, take note of how you are coping.  You might fail, but you’ll learn something and you’ll never regret trying.\r\n\r\n 4.  Ask yourself why\r\n\r\n More often than not we find ourselves seeking meaning in our lives and jobs, without really knowing what it is that gives us meaning.\r\n\r\n Being self-reflective and asking yourself the big questions about why something makes you happy, or why it makes you sad, is critically important to becoming a happier person at work.\r\n\r\n I do this all the time.  Being observant about the reasons I react with certain emotions isn’t easy – and it certainly takes time – but it absolutely makes you look at the bigger picture to understand yourself better (as fluffy as that may sound).\r\n\r\n 5.  Care about making friends at work\r\n\r\n Research has found employees who have close friends in the office are more likely to be productive, be happy about their work and feel connected to their employer (making it less likely they will quit).\r\n\r\n A sense of camaraderie is more than just about having ‘fun’ at work – it’s about surrounding yourself with like-minded people so you all feel like you’re in the same thing together.\r\n\r\n This allows employees to share the good and bad things as a team.

        "text":" There's the sort of sincere compassion about fucking up that empathy makes possible, although some of the AAs will nod smugly when they find out the slippee didn't take some of the basic suggestions.  Even newcomers who can't even start to quit yet and show up with suspicious flask-sized bulges in their coat pockets and list progressively to starboard as the meeting progresses are urged to keep coming, Hang In, stay, as long as they're not too disruptive.  Inebriates are discouraged from driving themselves home after the Lord's Prayer, but nobody's going to wrestle your keys away.  Boston AA stresses the utter autonomy of the individual member.  Please say and do whatever you wish.  Of course there are about a dozen basic suggestions, (138) and of course people who cockily decide they don't wish to abide by the basic suggestions are constantly going back Out There and then wobbling back in with their faces around their knees and confessing from the podium that they didn't take the suggestions and have paid full price for their willful arrogance and have learned the hard way and but now they're back, by God, and this time they're going to follow the suggestions to the bloody letter just see if they don't.  Gately's sponsor Francis ('Ferocious Francis') G., the Crocodile that Gately finally got up the juice to ask to be his sponsor, compares the totally optional basic suggestions in Boston AA to, say for instance if you're going to jump out of an airplane, they 'suggest' you wear a parachute.  But of course you do what you want.  Then he starts laughing until he's coughing so bad he has to sit down.\r\n The bitch of the thing is you have to want to.  If you don't want to do as you're told  —  I mean as it's suggested you do  —  it means that your own personal will is still in control, and Eugenio Martinez over at Ennet House never tires of pointing out that your personal will is the web your Disease sits and spins in, still.  The will you call your own ceased to be yours as of who knows how many Substance-drenched years ago.  It's now shot through with the spidered fibrosis of your Disease.  His own experience's term for the Disease is: The Spider.  (139) You have to Starve The Spider: you have to surrender your will.  This is why most people will Come In and Hang In only after their own entangled will has just about killed them.\r\n You have to want to surrender your will to people who know how to Starve The Spider.  You have to want to take the suggestions, want to abide by the traditions of anonymity, humility, surrender to the Group conscience.  If you don't obey, nobody will kick you out.  They won't have to.  You'll end up kicking yourself out, if you steer by your own sick will.  This is maybe why just about everybody in the White Flag Group tries so hard to be so disgustingly humble, kind, helpful, tactful, cheerful, nonjudgmental, tidy, energetic, sanguine, modest, generous, fair, orderly, patient, tolerant, attentive, truthful.  It isn't like the Group makes them do it.  It's more like that the only people who end up able to hang for serious time in AA are the ones who willingly try to be these things.  This is why, to the cynical newcomer or fresh Ennet House resident, serious AAs look like these weird combinations of Gandhi and Mr. Rogers with tattoos and enlarged livers and no teeth who used to beat wives and diddle daughters and now rhapsodize about their bowel movements.  It's all optional;  do it or die.\r\n So but like e.g.  Gately puzzled for quite some time about why these AA meetings where nobody kept order seemed so orderly.  No interrupting, fist-icuffery, no heckled invectives, no poisonous gossip or beefs over the tray's last Oreo.  Where was the hard-ass Sergeant at Arms who enforced these principles they guaranteed would save your ass?  Pat Montesian and Eugenio Martinez and Ferocious Francis the Crocodile wouldn't answer Gately's questions about where's the enforcement.  They just all smiled coy smiles and said to Keep Coming, an apothegm Gately found just as trite as 'Easy Does It!'  'Live and Let Live!’\r\n How do trite things get to be trite?  Why is the truth usually not just un-but anti-interesting?  Because every one of the seminal little mini-epiphanies you have in early AA is always polyesterishly banal, Gately admits to residents.  He'll tell how, as a resident, right after that one Harvard Square industrialgrunge post-punk, this guy whose name was Bernard but insisted on being called Plasmatron-7, right after old Plasmatron-7 drank nine bottles of NyQuil in the men's upstairs head and pitched forward face-first into his instant spuds at supper and got discharged on the spot, and got fireman-carried by Calvin Thrust right out to Comm.  Ave.'s Green Line T-stop, and Gately got moved up from the newest guys' 5-Man room to take Plas-matron-7's old bunk in the less-new guys' 3-Man room, Gately had an epi-phanic AA-related nocturnal dream he'll be the first to admit was banally trite.  (140) In the dream Gately and row after row of totally average and non-unique U.S. citizens were kneeling on their knees on polyester cushions in a crummy low-rent church basement.  The basement was your average low-rent church basement except for this dream-church's basement walls were of like this weird thin clean clear glass.  Everybody was kneeling on these cheap but comfortable cushions, and it was weird because nobody seemed to have any clear idea why they were all on their knees, and there was like no tier-boss or sergeant-at-arms-type figure around coercing them into kneeling, and yet there was this sense of some compelling unspoken reason why they were all kneeling.  It was one of those dream things where it didn't make sense but did.\r\n And but then some lady over to Gately's left got off her knees and all of a sudden stood up, just like to stretch, and the minute she stood up she was all of a sudden yanked backward with terrible force and sucked out through one of the clear glass walls of the basement, and Gately had winced to get ready for the sound of serious glass, but the glass wall didn't shatter so much as just let the cartwheeling lady sort of melt right through, and healed back over where she'd melted through, and she was gone.  Her cushion and then Gately notices a couple other polyester cushions in some of the rows here and there were empty.  And it was then, as he was looking around, that Gately in his dream looked slowly up overhead at the ceiling's exposed pipes and could now all of a sudden see, rotating slow and silent through the basement a meter above the different-shaped and -colored heads of the kneeling assembly, he could see a long plain hooked stick, like the crook of a giant shepherd, like the hook that appears from stage-left and drags bad acts out of tomato-range, moving slowly above them in French-curled circles, almost demurely, as if quietly scanning; "

        "text":"To be effective as cross-cultural communicators, one requires knowledge of other cultures and should communicate not only on a business level, but on a human level as well.\r\n Many business people seem to forget that when dealing with suppliers, vendors and their counterparts, they are dealing with human beings.  Whatever culture these people have been raised and reside in, they still display human characteristics such as happiness, sadness, confidence, insecurities, desire for acknowledgement and acceptance of others.  They experience anger and frustration, jealousy, fear of rejection, laziness and much more.\r\n\r\n We are predominantly driven by our emotions when making decisions;  whether to buy a product or service or to accept what other people say.  When dealing with others, people will allow their emotions, rather than logic, to influence them.\r\n\r\n Communicate on a human and business level\r\n\r\n When you work with suppliers, vendors, staff and customers, communication happens on two levels - the human level and the business level.\r\n\r\n The business level is about work related issues.  It is always better to open any interaction, be it written or verbal, on the human level before doing any business.  This satisfies the individual's need for acknowledgement, courteous treatment and acceptance of their viewpoints.\r\n\r\n When other people are angry or upset, they will demonstrate strong feelings.  It is important to address these feeling on a human level or the business aspect may be disrupted and conflict will be created.  You need to deal with the other person's feelings, and then deal with their problem.  When the business part of the interaction is completed, it is important to end on the human level.\r\n\r\n Get people to like you\r\n\r\n Much of our success in cross-cultural communication will be determined by our ability to sell ourselves to others.\r\n\r\n Whether in our personal or working lives;  people will judge us by what we say and what we do.  More importantly, this will be influenced by how likeable we are.  Likeability is about being human;  it's about displaying warmth.\r\n\r\n Likeability in people will also be measured by their ability to really listen and be interested in others.  Likeable people use your name and look as if they care.  Likeable people empathise with our problems and accept that we may have a different view of the world from them.  Likeability is demonstrated by a genuine smile, good eye contact, a sense of humour and relaxed open body language.\r\n\r\n Be a credible communicator\r\n\r\n When communicating with other people and particularly when you're trying to persuade them, the key ingredients are credibility and believability.  Your credibility will be determined by the verbal, vocal and visual elements of your message.  The words you say must be confirmed by your tone of voice and how you look.\r\n\r\n People will evaluate you based primarily on non-verbal information.  We all tend to make snap judgements about other people, and often make mistakes - we stereotype.\r\n\r\n So don't fall into this trap when you meet other people, or speak to them on the phone.  Also, be very aware, they will make decisions about you based on your tone of voice and body language.\r\n\r\n Low self-esteem and self-image affect body language and tone of voice.  People tend to make movements and display posture which indicates a lack of confidence.  The people you communicate with, will sense from your tone of voice whether you are confident and believe in what you say.\r\n\r\n If you don't feel confident in a particular situation, act or pretend to be confident.  Walk into a room as if you own the place.  Pick up the phone and speak in a clear, confident and distinct manner.\r\n\r\n You confidence and credibility will be determined by the self-talk that goes on inside your head.  By talking to yourself in a positive manner, you'll start to feel physically better;  you'll look better, sound more confident and credible.  Words have an enormous power to create change in the chemistry of your body.  Your heart rate, blood pressure, muscles, nerves and breathing will all react to the words you say to yourself and this will be evident to other people.\r\n\r\n Make no mistake about it, if you build your knowledge of other cultures and couple that with these three tips, you will become an even more effective cross-cultural communicator."

        "text":" and AMNAT's president LaMont Chu has used the excuse of Gopnik's emotional strikes against the U.S. South, plus Penn's arational lobbing at an Israel that at the summit was explicitly placed under AMNAT's mutual-defense umbrella, has used these as golden tactical geese, racking up serious INDDIR-points against a SOUTHAF and INDPAK whose hasty defensive alliance and shaky aim produce nothing more than a lot of irradiated cod off Gloucester.  Whenever there's a direct hit, Troeltsch sits up straight and gets to use the exclamation he's hit on for a kind of announcerial trademark:\r\n'Ho-/y CROW!'  But SOVWAR, beset from two vectors by AMNAT and IRLIBSYR (whose occasional lob Israel's way AMNAT, drawing a storm of diplomatic protest from SOUTHAF and INDPAK, keeps instructing Lord to log as 'regrettable mistargetings'), even with cutting-edge civil defense and EMPresistant communications, poor old SOVWAR is absorbing such serious collateral SUFDDIR that it's being inexorably impelled by game-theoretic logic to a position where it's going to pretty much have no choice but to go SACPOP against AMNAT.\r\n Now SOVWAR premier Timmy ('Sleepy T.P.') Peterson petitions O. P. Lord for capacity/authorization to place a scrambled call to Air Force One.  'Scrambled call' means they don't yell at each other publicly across the courts' map;  Lord has to ferry messages from one side the other, complete with inclined heads and hushed tones etc.  Premier and president exchange standard formalities.  Premier apologizes for the Prince Albert crack.  Hal, who's declining all public chemicals, he's decided, has a gander at Pemulis's rough tallies of Combatants' INDDIR/SUFDDIR ratios so far and agrees to bet Axford a U.S. finski no way AMNAT accepts SOVWAR's invitation to possible terms.  During actionless diplomatic intervals like this, Troeltsch is reduced to saying 'What a beautiful day for an Eschaton' over and over and asking people for their thoughts on the game until Pemulis tells him he's cruising to get dope-slapped.  There's pretty much nobody around: Tavis and Schtitt are off giving what are essentially recruiting-talks at indoor clubs in the west suburbs;  Pemulis'd let Tall Paul Shaw take the multi-emblazoned tow truck to take Mario down to the Public Gardens to watch the public I.-Day festivities with the Bolex H64;  the local kids often go home for the day;  a lot of the rest like to lie in the Viewing Rooms barely moving all I. Day until the dinner gala.  Lord tear-asses back and forth between Courts 6 ana 8, food cart clattering (the food cart, which Pemulis and Axford picked up from a kind of a seedy-looking orderly at SJOG hospital that Pemulis knew from Allston, has one of those crazy left front wheels that e.g.  seems always to afflict only your particular grocery cart in supermarkets, and makes a hell of a clattering racket when rushed), ferrying messages which the 18-and-Under guys can tell AMNAT and SOVWAR are making deliberately oblique and obtuse so Lord has to do that much more running: God is never a particularly popular role to have to play, and Lord this fall has already been the victim of several boarding-school-type pranks too puerile even to detail.  J. A. L. Struck Jr., who as usual has made a swine of himself with the suspiciously bracing cups of Gatorade, is abruptly ill all over his own lap and then sort of slumps to one side in his patio-chair with his face slack and white and doesn't hear Pemulis's quick analysis that Hal might as well give Axhandle the $ right now, because LaMont Chu can parse a Decision Tree with the best of them, and the D. Tree's now indicating peace terms in whatever a D. Tree's version of neon letters is, because the biggest priority for AMNAT right at 1515h.  is to avoid having to SACPOP with SOVWAR, since if the game stops right now AMNAT's probably won, whereas if they SACPOP with SOVWAR, trading massive infliction of INDDIR for massive body-shots of SUFDDIR, staying more or less even with each other, AM-NAT'll still be the same number of points ahead of SOVWAR overall, but it'll have taken such heavy SUFDDIR debits that IRLIBSYR  —  never forget IRLIBSYR, brilliantly if obnoxiously Imam'd today by eleven-year-old eye-browless Evan Ingersoll of Binghamton NNY  —  by staying out of the SACPOP-fest and lobbing sporadically at SOVWAR just often enough to rack up serious INDDIR but not quite enough to piss SOVWAR off enough to provoke the retaliatory SSlO-wave that would mean significant SUFDDIR, could well have a serious shot at overtaking AMNAT for the overall Eschaton, especially when you factored in the f(x) advantages for bellicosity and nonexistent civil defense.  At some point Axford has passed the remainder of the cigarette back over toward Struck without looking to see that Struck is no longer in his chair, and Hal finds himself taking the proffered duBois and smoking dope in public without even thinking about it or having consciously decided to go ahead.  Sure enough, poor red-faced runny-nosed Lord is making way too many clattering trips between Courts 6 and 8 for it to mean anything but peace terms.  Evan Ingersoll is positively strip-mining his right nostril.  Finally Lord stops with the running back and forth and positions himself in the ad service box of Court 7 and loads a new diskette into the Yushityu.  Struck moans something in a possibly foreign tongue.  All the other upperclass spectators have scooted their chairs well away from Struck.  Troeltsch extends a blood-blistered palm and rubs the tips of the hand's fingers together at Hal, and Hal forks over the fin without handing the thin cigarette back over to Axford, somehow.  Pemulis has leaned forward intently with his pointy chin in his hands;  he seems completely absorbed.\r\n Interdependence Day Y.D.A.U.'s Eschaton enters probably its most crucial phase.  Lord, at his cart and portable TP, puts on the white beanie (n.b.: not the black or the red beanie) that signals a temporary cessation of SPASEX between two Combatants but allows all other Combatants to go on pursuing their strategic interests as they see fit.  SOVWAR and AMNAT are thus pretty vulnerable right now.\r\n SOVWAR's Premier Peterson and Air Marshal Kittenplan, carrying their white janitorial stockpile-bucket between them, walk across Europe and the Atlantic to parley with AMNAT President Chu and Supreme Commander Possalthwaite in what looks to be roughly Sierra Leone.  Various territories smolder quietly.\r\n The other players are mostly standing around beating their arms against their chests to stay warm.  A few hesitant white flakes appear and swirl around and melt into dark stars the moment they hit court.  A couple ostensible world leaders run here and there in a rather unstatesmanlike fashion with their open mouths directed at the sky, trying to catch bits of the fall's first snow.  Yesterday it had been warmer and rained.\r\n Axford speculates about whether snow will mean Schtitt might consent to inflate the Lung even before the Fundraiser two weeks hence.  Struck is threatening to fall out of his chair.  Pemulis, leaning forward intently, wearing his Mr. Howell yachting cap, ignores everyone.  He hates to type and keeps his tallies via pencil and clipboard a la deLint.  The idling Ford sedan is conspicuous for the excruciated full-color old Nunhagen Aspirin ad on the green of its right rear door.  Hal and Axford are passing what looks to the Combatants like a suckerless Tootsie-Roll stick back and forth between them, and occasionally to Troeltsch.  Trevor ('The Axhandle') Axford has a total of only three-and-a-half digits on his right hand.\r\n From West House you can hear Mrs. Clarke and the time-and-a-half holiday kitchen staff preparing the Interdependence Day gala dinner, which always includes dessert.\r\n Now REDCHI, itself quietly trying to rack up some unanswered INDDIR, sends a towering topspin Job into INDPAK's quadrant, scoring what REDCHI claims is a direct hit on Karachi and what warheadless INDPAK claims is only an indirect hit on Karachi.  It's an uneasy moment: a dispute such as this would never occur in the real God's real world, since the truth would be manifest in the actual size of the actual wienie roast in the actual Karachi.  But God here is played by Otis P. Lord, and Lord is number-crunching so fiendishly at the cart's Yushityu, trying to confirm the verisimilitude of the peace terms AMNAT and SOVWAR are hashing out, that he can't even pretend to have seen where REDCHI's strike against INDPAK landed w/ respect to Karachi's T-shirt  —  which is admittedly kind of mashed and woppsed up, though this could be primarily from breezes and feet  —  and in his lapse of omniscience cannot see how he's supposed to allocate the relevant INDDIR- and SUFDDIR-points.  Troeltsch doesn't know whether to say 'Holy CROW!'  or not.  Lord, vexed by a lapse it's tough to see how any mortal could have avoided, appeals over to Michael Pemulis for an independent ruling;  and when Pemulis gravely shakes his whitehatted head, pointing out that Lord is God and either sees or doesn't, in Eschaton, Lord has an intense little crying fit that's made abruptly worse when now J. J. Penn of INDPAK all of a sudden gets the idea to start claiming that now that it's snowing the snow totally affects blast area and fire area and pulse-intensity and maybe also has fallout implications, and he says Lord has to now completely redo everybody's damage parameters before anybody can form realistic strategies from here on out.\r\n Pemulis's chairlegs shriek and make red-skin peanuts spill out in a kind of cornucopic cone-shape and he's up in his capacity as sort of eminence grise of Eschaton and ranging up and down just outside the theater's chain-link fencing, giving J. J. Penn the very roughest imaginable side of his tongue. "

        "text":"and when a mild-faced guy in a cardigan happened to stand up and was hooked by the hooked stick and pulled ass-over-teakettle out through the soundless glass membrane Gately turned his big head as far as he could without leaving the cushion and could see, now, just outside the wall's clean pane, trolling with the big stick, an extraordinarily snappily dressed and authoritative figure manipulating the giant shepherd's crook with one hand and coolly examining the nails of his other hand from behind a mask that was simply the plain yellow smily-face circle that accompanied invitations to have a nice day.  The figure was so impressive and trustworthy and casually self-assured as to be both soothing and compelling.\r\n The authoritative figure radiated good cheer and abundant charm and limitless patience.  It manipulated the big stick in the coolly purposeful way of the sort of angler who you know isn't going to throw back anything he catches.  The slow silent stick with the hook he held was what kept them all kneeling below the baroque little circumferences of its movement overhead.\r\n One of Ennet House's live-in Staffers' rotating P.M. jobs is to be awake and on-call in the front office all night for Dream Duty  —  people in early recovery from Substances often get hit with real horror-show dreams, or else traumatically seductive Substance-dreams, and sometimes trite but important epiphanic dreams, and the Staffer on Dream Duty is required to be up doing paperwork or sit-ups or staring out the broad bay window in the front office downstairs, ready to make coffee and listen to the residents' dreams and offer the odd practical upbeat Boston-AA-type insight into possible implications for the dreamer's progress in recovery  —  but Gately had no need to clomp downstairs for a Staffer's feedback on this one, since it was so powerfully, tritely obvious.  It had come clear to Gately that Boston AA had the planet's most remorselessly hard-ass and efficient sergeant at arms.  Gately lay there, overhanging all four sides of his bunk, his broad square forehead beaded with revelation: Boston AA's Sergeant at Arms stood outside the orderly meeting halls, in that much-invoked Out There where exciting clubs full of good cheer throbbed gaily below lit signs with neon bottles endlessly pouring.  AA's patient enforcer was always and everywhere Out There: it stood casually checking its cuticles in the astringent fluorescence of pharmacies that took forged Talwin scrips for a hefty surcharge, in the onionlight through paper shades in the furnished rooms of strung-out nurses who financed their own cages' maintenance with stolen pharmaceutical samples, in the isopropyl reek of the storefront offices of stooped old chain-smoking MD's whose scrip-pads were always out and who needed only to hear 'pain' and see cash.  In the home of a snot-strangled Canadian VIP and the office of an implacable Revere A.D.A. whose wife has opted for dentures at thirty-five.  AA's disciplinarian looked damn good and smelled even better and dressed to impress and his blank black-on-yellow smile never faltered as he sincerely urged you to have a nice day.\r\n Just one more last nice day.  Just one.\r\n And that was the first night that cynical Gately willingly took the basic suggestion to get down on his big knees by his undersized spring-shot Ennet House bunk and Ask For Help from something he still didn't believe in, ask for his own sick Spider-bit will to be taken from him and fumigated and squished.\r\n But and plus in Boston AA there is, unfortunately, dogma, too, it turns out;  and some of it is both dated and smug.  And there's an off-putting jargon in the Fellowship, a psychobabbly dialect that's damn near impossible to follow at first, says Ken Erdedy, the college-boy ad exec semi-new at Ennet House, complaining to Gately at the White Flag meeting's raffle-break, Boston AA meetings are unusually long, an hour and a half instead of the national hour, but here they also have this formal break at about 45 minutes where everybody can grab a sandwich or Oreo and a sixth cup of coffee and stand around and chat, and bond, where people can pull their sponsors aside and confide some trite insight or emotional snafu that the sponsor can swiftly, privately validate but also place in the larger imperative context of the primary need not to absorb a Substance today, just today, no matter what happens.  While everybody's bonding and interfacing in a bizarre system of catchphrases, there's also the raffle, another Boston idiosyncrasy: the newest of the White Flag newcomers trying to Get Active In Group Service wobble around with rattan baskets and packs of tickets, one for a buck and three for a fin, and the winner eventually gets announced from the podium and everyone hisses and shouts 'Fix!'  and laughs, and the winner wins a Big Book or an As Bill Sees It or a Came To Believe, which if he's got some sober time in and already owns all the AA literature from winning previous raffles he'll stand up and publicly offer it to any newcomer who wants it, which means any newcomer with enough humble desperation to come up to him and ask for it and risk being given a phone number to carry around in his wallet.\r\n At the White Flag raffle-break Gately usually stands around chainsmoking with the Ennet House residents, so that he's casually available to answer questions and empathize with complaints.  He usually waits til after the meeting to do his own complaining to Ferocious Francis, with whom Gately now shares the important duty of 'breaking down the hall,' sweeping floors and emptying ashtrays and wiping down the long cafeteria tables, which F.F.G.'s function is limited because he's on oxygen and his function consists mostly of standing there sucking oxygen and holding an unlit cigar while Gately breaks down the hall.  Gately rather likes Ken Erdedy, who came into the House about a month ago from some cushy Belmont rehab.  Erdedy's an upscale guy, what Gately's mother would have called a yuppie, an account executive at Viney and Veals Advertising downtown his Intake form said, and though he's about Gately's age he's so softly good-looking in that soft mannequinish way Harvard and Tufts schoolboys have, and looks so smooth and groomed all the time even in jeans and a plain cotton sweater, that Gately thinks of him as much younger, totally ungrizzled, and refers to him mentally as 'kid.'  Erdedy's in the House mainly for 'marijuana addiction,' which Gately has a hard time Identifying with anybody getting in enough trouble with weed to leave his job and condo to bunk in a room full of tattooed guys who smoke in their sleep, and to work like pumping gas (Erdedy just started his nine-month humility job at the Merit station down by North Harvard St. in Allston) for 32 minimum-wage hours a week.  Or to have his leg be joggling like that all the time from tensions of Withdrawal: from fucking grass?  But it's not Gately's place to say what's bad enough to make somebody Come In and what isn't, not for anybody else but himself, and the shapely but big-time-troubled new girl Kate Gompert  —  who mostly just stays in her bed in the new women's 5- Woman room when she isn't at meetings, and is on a Suicidality Contract with Pat, and isn't getting the usual pressure to get a humility job, and gets to get some sort of scrip-meds out of the meds locker every morning  —  Kate Gompert's counselor Danielle S. reported at the last Staff Meeting that Kate had finally opened up and told her she'd mostly Come In for weed, too, and not the lightweight prescription tranqs she'd listed on her Intake form.  Gately used to treat weed like tobacco.  He wasn't like some other narcotics addicts who smoked weed when they couldn't get anything else;  he always smoked weed and could always get something else and simply smoked weed while he did whatever else he could get.\r\n Gately doesn't miss weed much.  The shocker-type AA Miracle is he doesn't much miss the Demerol,  either, today.\r\n A hard November wind is spattering goopy sleet against the broad windows all around the hall.  The Provident Nursing Home cafeteria is lit by a checkerboard array of oversized institutional bulbs overhead, a few of which are always low and give off fluttery strobes.  The fluttering bulbs are why Pat Montesian and all the other photic-seizure-prone area AAs never go to White Flag, opting for the Freeway Group over in Brookline or the candyass Lake Street meeting up in West Newton on Sunday nights, which Pat M. bizarrely drives all the way up from her home down on the South Shore in Milton to get to, to hear people talk about their analysts and Saabs.  There is no way to account for people's taste in AA.  The White Flag hall is so brightly lit up all Gately can see out any of the windows is a kind of shiny drooling black against everybody's pale reflection.\r\n Miracle's one of the Boston AA terms Erdedy and the brand-new and very shaky veiled girl resident standing over him complain they find hard to stomach, as in 'We're All Miracles Here' and 'Don't Leave Five Minutes Before The Miracle Happens' and 'To Stay Sober For 24 Hours Is A Miracle.’\r\n Except the brand-new girl, either Joelle V. or Joelle D., who said she'd hit the occasional meeting in the past before her Bottom and had been roundly repelled, and is still pretty much cynical and repelled, she said on the way down to Provident under Gately's direct new-resident supervision, says she finds even the word Miracle preferable to the constant AA talk about 'the Grace of God,' which reminds her of wherever she grew up, where she's indicated places of worship were often aluminum trailers or fiberboard shacks and church-goers played with copperheads in the services to honor something about serpents and tongues.\r\n Gately's also observed how Erdedy's also got that Tufts-Harvard way of speaking without seeming to move his lower jaw.\r\n 'It's as if it's its own country or something,' Erdedy complains, legs crossed in maybe a bit of a faggy schoolboy way, looking around at the raffle-break, sitting in Gately's generous shadow.  'The first time I ever talked, over at the St. E's meeting on Wednesday, somebody comes up after the Lord's Prayer and says \"Good to hear you, I could really I.D. with that bottom you were sharing about, the isolating, the can't-and-can't, it's the greenest I've felt in months, hearing you.\"  And then gives me this raffle ticket with his phone number that I didn't ask for and says I'm right where I'm supposed to be, which I have to say I found a bit patronizing.’\r\n The best noise Gately produces is his laugh, which booms and reassures, and a certain haunted hardness goes out of his face when he laughs.  Like most huge men, Gately has kind of a high hoarse speaking voice;  his larynx sounds compressed.  ' I still hate that right-where-you're-supposed-to-be thing,' he says, laughing.  He likes that Erdedy, sitting, looks right up at him and cocks his head slightly to let Gately know he's got his full attention.  Gately doesn't know that this is a requisite for a white-collar job where you have to show you're attending fully to clients who are paying major sums and get to expect an overt display of full attention.  Gately is still not yet a good judge of anything about upscale people except\r\n where they tend to hide their valuables.\r\n Boston AA, with its emphasis on the Group, is intensely social.  The raffle-break goes on and on.  An intoxicated street-guy with a venulated nose and missing incisors and electrician's tape wrapped around his shoes is trying to sing 'Volare' up at the empty podium microphone.  He is gently, cheerfully induced offstage by a Crocodile with a sandwich and an arm around the shoulders.  There's a certain pathos to the Crocodile's kindness, his clean flannel arm around the weatherstained shoulders, which pathos Gately feels and likes being able to feel it, while he says 'But at least the \"Good to hear you\" I quit minding.  It's just what they say when somebody's got done speaking.  They can't say like \"Good job\" or \"You spoke well,\" cause it can't be anybody's place here to judge if anybody else did good or bad or whatnot.  You know what I'm saying, Tiny, there?’\r\n Tiny Ewell, in a blue suit and laser chronometer and tiny shoes whose shine you could read by, is sharing a dirty aluminum ashtray with Nell Gunther, who has a glass eye which she amuses herself by usually wearing so the pupil and iris face in and the dead white and tiny manufacturer's specifications on the back of the eye face out.  Both of them are pretending to study the blond false wood of the tabletop, and Ewell makes a bit of a hostile show of not looking up or responding to Gately or entering into the conversation in any way, which is his choice and on him alone, so Gately lets it go.  Wade McDade has a Walkman going, which is technically OK at the raffle-break although it's not a real good idea.  Chandler Foss is flossing his teeth and pretending to throw the used floss at Jennifer Belbin.  Most of the Ennet House residents are mingling satisfactorily.  The couple of residents that are black are mingling with other blacks.  (141) The Diehl kid and Doony Glynn are amusing themselves telling homosexuality jokes to Morris Hanley, who sits smoothing his hair with his fingertips, pretending to not even acknowledge, his left hand still bandaged.  Alfonso Parias-Carbo is standing with three Allston Group guys, smiling broadly and nodding, not understanding a word anybody says.  Bruce Green has gone downstairs to the men's head and amused Gately by asking his permission first.  Gately told him to go knock himself out.  Green has good big arms and no gut, even after all the Substances, and Gately suspects he might have played some ball at some point. "
