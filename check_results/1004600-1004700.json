        "text":" cartwheels could be heard grinding on the road far beneath;  and the suck and sighing of the waves sounded gently, persistently, for ever.\r\n Shading her eyes with her hand Mrs. Pascoe stood in her cabbage-garden looking out to sea.  Two steamers and a sailing-ship crossed each other;  passed each other;  and in the bay the gulls kept alighting on a log, rising high, returning again to the log, while some rode in upon the waves and stood on the rim of the water until the moon blanched all to whiteness.\r\n Mrs. Pascoe had gone indoors long ago.\r\n But the red light was on the columns of the Parthenon, and the Greek women who were knitting their stockings and sometimes crying to a child to come and have the insects picked from its head were as jolly as sand-martins in the heat, quarrelling, scolding, suckling their babies, until the ships in the Piraeus fired their guns.\r\n The sound spread itself flat, and then went tunnelling its way with fitful explosions among the channels of the islands.\r\n Darkness drops like a knife over Greece.\r\n \"The guns?\"  said Betty Flanders, half asleep, getting out of bed and going to the window, which was decorated with a fringe of dark leaves.\r\n \"Not at this distance,\" she thought.  \"It is the sea.\"\r\n Again, far away, she heard the dull sound, as if nocturnal women were beating great carpets.  There was Morty lost, and Seabrook dead;  her sons fighting for their country.  But were the chickens safe?  Was that some one moving downstairs?  Rebecca with the toothache?  No.  The nocturnal women were beating great carpets.  Her hens shifted slightly on their perches.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER FOURTEEN \r\n \"He left everything just as it was,\" Bonamy marvelled.  \"Nothing arranged.  All his letters strewn about for any one to read.  What did he expect?  Did he think he would come back?\"  he mused, standing in the middle of Jacob's room.\r\n The eighteenth century has its distinction.  These houses were built, say, a hundred and fifty years ago.  The rooms are shapely, the ceilings high;  over the doorways a rose or a ram's skull is carved in the wood.  Even the panels, painted in raspberry-coloured paint, have their distinction.\r\n Bonamy took up a bill for a hunting-crop.\r\n \"That seems to be paid,\" he said.\r\n There were Sandra's letters.\r\n Mrs. Durrant was taking a party to Greenwich.\r\n Lady Rocksbier hoped for the pleasure...\r\n Listless is the air in an empty room, just swelling the curtain;  the flowers in the jar shift.  One fibre in the wicker arm-chair creaks, though no one sits there.\r\n Bonamy crossed to the window.  Pickford's van swung down the street.  The omnibuses were locked together at Mudie's corner.  Engines throbbed, and carters, jamming the brakes down, pulled their horses sharp up.  A harsh and unhappy voice cried something unintelligible.  And then suddenly all the leaves seemed to raise themselves.\r\n \"Jacob!  Jacob!\"  cried Bonamy, standing by the window.  The leaves sank down again.\r\n \"Such confusion everywhere!\"  exclaimed Betty Flanders, bursting open the bedroom door.\r\n Bonamy turned away from the window.\r\n \"What am I to do with these, Mr. Bonamy?\"\r\n She held out a pair of Jacob's old shoes."

Not proper sobbing, just silent tears that ran down her face and which she wiped away with the palm of her hand.  I couldn’t think what to say to her.\r\n\r\n Which was fine.  I had plenty to say to everyone else.\r\n\r\n All but one of the reporters cleared off by half past seven.  I didn’t know if they had given up, or if Thomas’s habit of posting bits of Lego out of the letter box every time they passed another note through had become boring.  I told Louisa to bath Thomas for me, mainly because I wanted her to get out of the kitchen, but also because that way I could go through all the messages on our answerphone and delete the newspaper ones while she couldn’t hear me.  Twenty-six.  Twenty-six of the buggers.  And all sounding so nice, so understanding.  Some of them even offered her money.\r\n\r\n I pressed delete on every one.  Even those offering money, although I admit I was a teeny bit tempted to see how much they were offering.  All the while, I heard Lou talking to Thomas in the bathroom, the whine and splash of him dive-bombing his six inches of soapsuds with the Batmobile.  That’s the thing you don’t know about children unless you have them – bath time, Lego and fish fingers don’t allow you to dwell on tragedy for too long.  And then I hit the last message.\r\n\r\n ‘Louisa?  It’s Camilla Traynor.  Will you call me?  As soon as possible?’\r\n\r\n I stared at the answerphone.  I rewound and replayed it.  Then I ran upstairs and whipped Thomas out of the bath so fast my boy didn’t even know what hit him.  He was standing there, the towel wrapped tightly around him like a compression bandage, and Lou, stumbling and confused, was already halfway down the stairs, me pushing her by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n ‘What if she hates me?’\r\n\r\n ‘She didn’t sound like she hated you.’\r\n\r\n ‘But what if the press are surrounding them there?  What if they think it’s all my fault?’  Her eyes were wide and terrified.  ‘What if she’s ringing to tell me he’s done it?’\r\n\r\n ‘Oh, for Christ’s sake, Lou.  For once in your life, just get a grip.  You won’t know anything unless you call.  Call her.  Just call.  You don’t have a bloody choice.’\r\n\r\n I ran back into the bathroom, to set Thomas free.  I shoved him into his pyjamas, told him that Granny had a biscuit for him if he ran to the kitchen super fast.  And then I peered out of the bathroom door, to peek at my sister on the phone down in the hallway.\r\n\r\n She was turned away from me, one hand smoothing the hair at the back of her head.  She reached out a hand to steady herself.\r\n\r\n ‘Yes,’ she was saying.  ‘I see.’  And then, ‘Okay.’\r\n\r\n And after a pause, ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n She looked down at her feet for a good minute after she’d put the phone down.\r\n\r\n ‘Well?’  I said.\r\n\r\n She looked up as if she’d only just seen me there, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n ‘It was nothing about the newspapers,’ she said, her voice still numb with shock.  ‘She asked me – begged me – to come to Switzerland.  And she’s booked me on to the last flight out this evening.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 26\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In other circumstances I suppose it might have seemed strange that I, Lou Clark, a girl who had rarely been more than a bus ride from her home town in twenty years, was now flying to her third country in less than a week.  But I packed an overnight case with the swift efficiency of an air stewardess, rejecting all but the barest necessities.  Treena ran around silently fetching any other things she thought I might need, and then we headed downstairs.  We stopped halfway down.  Mum and Dad were already in the hall, standing side by side in the ominous way they used to do when we sneaked back late from a night out.\r\n\r\n ‘What’s going on?’  Mum was staring at my case.\r\n\r\n Treena had stopped in front of me.\r\n\r\n ‘Lou’s going to Switzerland,’ she said.  ‘And she needs to leave now.  There’s only one flight left today.’\r\n\r\n We were about to move when Mum stepped forward.\r\n\r\n ‘No.’  Her mouth was set into an unfamiliar line, her arms folded awkwardly in front of her.  ‘Really.  I don’t want you involved.  If this is what I think it is, then no.’\r\n\r\n ‘But –’ Treena began, glancing behind at me.\r\n\r\n ‘No,’ said Mum, and her voice held an unusually steely quality.  ‘No buts.  I’ve been thinking about this, about everything you told us.  It’s wrong.  Morally wrong.  And if you get embroiled in it and you’re seen to be helping a man kill himself, then you could end up in all sorts of trouble.’\r\n\r\n ‘Your mum’s right,’ Dad said.\r\n\r\n ‘We’ve seen it in the news.  This could affect your whole life, Lou.  This college interview, everything.  If you get a criminal record, you will never get a college degree or a good job or anything –’\r\n\r\n ‘He’s asked for her to come.  She can’t just ignore him,’ Treena interrupted.\r\n\r\n ‘Yes.  Yes, she can.  She’s given six months of her life to this family.  And a fat lot of good it’s brought her, judging by the state of things.  A fat lot of good it’s brought this family, with people banging on the door and all the neighbours thinking we’ve been done for benefit fraud or some such.  No, she’s finally got the chance to make something of herself, and now they want her to go to that dreadful place in Switzerland and get involved in God knows what.  Well, I say no.  No, Louisa.’\r\n\r\n ‘But she has to go,’ Treena said.\r\n\r\n ‘No, she doesn’t.  She’s done enough.  She said herself last night, she’s done everything she could.’  Mum shook her head.  ‘Whatever mess the Traynors are going to make of their lives going to this … this … whatever they’re going to do to their own son, I don’t want Louisa involved.  I don’t want her ruining her whole life.’\r\n\r\n ‘I think I can make my own mind up,’ I said.\r\n\r\n ‘I’m not sure you can.  This is your friend, Louisa.  This is a young man with his whole life ahead of him.  You cannot be part of this.  I’m … I’m shocked that you could even consider it.’  Mum’s voice had a new, hard edge.  ‘I didn’t bring you up to help someone end his life!  Would you end Granddad’s life?  Do you think we should shove him off to Dignitas too?’\r\n\r\n ‘Granddad is different.’\r\n\r\n ‘No, he isn’t.  He can’t do what he used to.  But his life is precious.  Just as Will’s is precious.’\r\n\r\n ‘It’s not my decision, Mum.  It’s Will’s.  The whole point of this is to support Will.’\r\n\r\n ‘Support Will?  I’ve never heard such rubbish.  You are a child, Louisa.  You’ve seen nothing, done nothing.  And you have no idea what this is going to do to you. "

He was very successfull in his job and there was always a full house at all his performances.  Life was sweet.  The money was rolling in, he had one of the best cabins, ate the best food, mixed with the best people.  All was fine until one day the captain bought a parrot.\r\n\r\n The highlight of the parrot's day was going along to see the magician in action in the evening.  During the magician's performances, the parrot would watch him very carefully during each trick, and immediately after the magician had completed the trick the parrot would call out in a loud squawk, \"It's up his sleeve, it's up his sleeve,\" or, \"It's down his trousers, it's down his trousers,\" each time ruining the magician's trick.\r\n\r\n Well life was no longer as sweet and the magician started to struggle to satisfy the passengers.  The magician naturally got very tired of the parrot and longed to kill it.\r\n\r\n Then one night in the middle of the magician's performances, the ship hit an iceberg and sank.  Everyone was killed except for the magician and the parrot.  The magician managed to swim to a piece of wreckage, climbed aboard and collapsed.  The parrot flew towards the magician and perched on the edge of the raft and stared at the magician.\r\n\r\n For a whole day the magician was unconscious, and all this time the parrot did not take his eyes off him.  Eventually the magician started to stir, and looked up not really knowing where he was or what had happened.  He eventually found enough energy to sit up.  He then noticed the parrot, who had not stopped focusing his eyes on him all this time.\r\n\r\n \"Alright, I give up ...\" chirped the parrot, \"... what have you done with the ship?\""
