        "text":" It was more agreeable than having dinner alone with her, which was always like the Spanish Inquisition.  Francesca was tired when she went upstairs.  It had been a long evening.\r\n She spent the weekend in Connecticut with her father and Avery after that.  He was working on a new painting and in his studio most of the time, which gave her a chance to go for long walks with Avery and relax.\r\n “How are you all doing after Eileen?”  Avery asked her gently, and Francesca sighed as she answered.  She was still sad about it.\r\n “We all miss her.  She put a little extra youth in the group, despite her boy-craziness.  She was more like a college kid than a grownup.  I still haven’t told my mom, and I won’t.  She doesn’t need to know.  She’d just give me a headache about it, and it was bad enough.  She was a real example of the kind of dating risks not to take.  She would go out with anything that moved.  She always thought it was safe, even when you could see it wasn’t.  She had miserable judgment.”\r\n “What about you?  How’s your dating life these days?”  Avery was worried about her.  Todd had moved out more than eight months before, and Francesca had made no real effort to meet someone else.  She didn’t seem to care.\r\n “I don’t have one.  I’m not even sure if I want one.  I never meet anyone I’m interested in through my work.  The artists I meet are all flakes, or pompous, or narcissistic.  It just seems like too much work, and the clients who hit on me are always jerks.  The nice ones are married.”\r\n “You’re too young to give up,” Avery said firmly.\r\n “I don’t know.  Maybe I’m not.  I miss having someone in my life, but I don’t want a mismatch like I had with Todd, and figure it out five years later.  You invest four years,\r\nfigure out he’s the wrong guy, and then have a year of grief, and break up, and it breaks your heart.  And five years go down the drain.  I’m finding it a little hard to reenlist.”\r\n “I hear Todd’s engaged,” Avery said cautiously.\r\n “Yes, he is.  Brave guy.  He was suddenly in a big hurry to get married and have kids.  God knows if he’s marrying the right woman.  All he wants is a brood mare and someone to take to the Christmas party at his law firm.  I’m not the type for either.”\r\n “That’s a little harsh on both of you,” Avery said gently.  She liked Todd.  Just not for Francesca.  She had never thought it was right, even in the beginning when they did.  Avery had never thought he was interesting enough for her.\r\n “Maybe it isn’t,” Francesca answered.  “I don’t know what I want anymore.  Arty, conservative, married, not married, living together, not.  It’s all so goddamn complicated, and at this age everyone is damaged.  They’ve all been screwed over by someone else, and so have I.”  She was thinking of Chris when she said it.  He readily admitted to being relationship-phobic, and she was beginning to feel that way too.  “Maybe I’m too comfortable by myself now.”  She’d been desperately lonely at first without Todd, but she wasn’t anymore.  She liked doing what she wanted without having to consult anyone.  “My roommates keep me company.  I have Ian as the token child in my life, my artists to drive me nuts, they’re kind of like having permanent adolescents in your life.  Why do I need a man?”\r\n “When was the last time you had sex?”  Avery asked her bluntly.  “You might not want to give that up quite yet at thirty-five.  It’s kind of nice.”\r\n “Oh that.”  Francesca grinned sheepishly.  “I don’t even miss that anymore.  I just turn it off.”  It had been more than a year since she and Todd had stopped sleeping with each other, and having sex, before he left.  “And I don’t have to shave my legs.”\r\n “That’s attractive,” Avery teased her.  She was worried about her.  She seemed turned off, or shut down.  It had taken her longer than expected to get over Todd, and it had obviously been a more traumatic disappointment than Avery thought it would be at first.  But five years was a long time.  And her struggle to keep the gallery and the house had been frightening for her.\r\n “I do want to do some new things though.  I’m going to Art Basel in Miami this year, just for the hell of it.  I’m not showing there.  And next summer I want to go someplace other than Maine.  I had a great time, but it reminds me too much of Todd.  They’re his friends, not mine.  I don’t know, maybe Europe next year.  But not with my mother,” she said, and Avery laughed.  They both agreed that Thalia was high maintenance, and traveling with her would have been a nightmare for Francesca.  “Maybe I’ll take a trip with Marya next year, if she’s not married by then,” Francesca said pensively.  She loved talking to her stepmother.  It gave her perspective about life, and she was so kind.  She was a terrific friend.\r\n “Is Marya getting married?”  Avery looked surprised.\r\n “She might.  She hasn’t decided yet.  She and Charles-Edouard are in love.  He’s getting divorced.”\r\n “That’s interesting.  They’re terrific together.  You know the old saying, there’s a lid for every pot.  You just have to find yours.”  The trouble was that Francesca wasn’t trying, and it wasn’t going to fall down the chimney in a white beard and red velvet suit into her arms.  Avery remembered too easily all the men she had gone out with before Henry, the bad relationships she’d had, the disappointments, the heartbreaks, and the good relationships too.  Avery hadn’t been desperate to get married either, but she did want to find the right man to spend time with.  She never settled for less.  It had taken her until she was fifty to find him, and the minute she met him, she knew Henry Thayer was it.  That hadn’t happened to Francesca yet, and Avery hoped it wouldn’t take her as long.  At least she was enjoying her life in the meantime.  But Avery couldn’t decide if Francesca’s roommates were a good idea or not.  They kind of blunted her hunger for meeting anyone, and it was too easy to just content herself with being with them, with no relationship in her life.\r\n Her father came out of the barn that was his studio then, and smiled at both women as he put an arm around their shoulders.  “How’s my favorite business partner?”  he asked as he kissed his daughter.  “Are we rich yet?”\r\n “Maybe next year.”  Francesca grinned.  But the gallery was doing well.  Better than it had the year before.  Little by little, she was building the business, and it was making a small profit, more so than before, although not a big one yet.  But it gave her hope.  She was hanging in.\r\n Before she left Connecticut after the weekend, Francesca promised to invite them for one of Charles-Edouard and Marya’s world-famous dinners, and her father was thrilled.  He liked them both, although he had only met Marya twice, and Charles-Edouard once, but he thought he was a great guy.  And he loved the Cuban cigars he had shared with him, even if Avery disapproved of their smoking.\r\n Francesca thought about it on the drive home, and once again Avery had given her perspective.  She thought about what she’d said about dating, and finding the right lid.  In her case she wasn’t even sure of the size and shape of her pot, let alone what lid would fit on it.  She felt as though she had changed a lot in the last year without Todd.  She felt more confident and sure of herself.  She had come into her own without him, more than she had with him, which told her a lot about the relationship and herself.  She wasn’t a half of anything now, she was a whole person.  It had also done her good to have roommates and have to adjust to other people.  As an only child, she’d never had to do that when she was young.  She respected Marya and Chris, and they were all very different.  And it was fun having Ian in her life.  She’d never been that close to a child before.  He was kind of a\r\n good introduction to it.  Having kids didn’t seem as daunting now as it had before, as long as they were as cute as Ian, although there was no guarantee of that.  He was about as cute as it got.\r\n When she got home, she could hear noise in the kitchen, and went downstairs to see what it was.  It was late for dinner, and they didn’t seem like happy sounds.  She could hear loud noises and the clanking of pots.  When she walked down the stairs, she saw her kitchen under six inches of water.  Charles-Edouard was wearing a Panama hat and shorts, barefoot in the water, waving a cigar as he gave directions and asked questions.  Marya was wearing Wellington boots and trying to help with a distressed expression.  The kitchen table and chairs were in the garden with things stacked on them.  And Chris was soaking wet in a bathing suit and sweatshirt, wading through the water and crawling under the sink, trying to locate the pipe that had exploded and flooded the kitchen.\r\n “Oh shit,” she said, rolling up her jeans and taking off her own shoes as she waded in next to Chris.  “What can I do to help?  I’m sorry you got stuck with this.”  He looked over his shoulder at her with a grin, and she felt guilty for not being there when it happened, and for all he was doing.  This was exactly what Todd had hated about the house and why he wanted to sell it the year before.  It was a very old house and things happened.  Charles-Edouard poured her a glass of wine and handed it to her.  It looked like a party in the midst of a flood.  Charles-Edouard and Ian were having fun.  The others weren’t.\r\n “I got the water turned off,” Chris explained.  “It happened while we were all out.  It’s probably been running all day.  We’ll have to find someone to get the water out of here tomorrow, and you need a plumber.  I think this one is over my head.”  As he said it, Ian took a leap off the stairs and landed in the large pool of water with a delighted splash.\r\n “This is cool!”  he squealed, and Chris told him to stop it or go back upstairs.  Ian made a face and waded toward Charles-Edouard.  There wasn’t much they could do about it that night, although Chris made a few more passes at trying to locate the leak and finally gave up.  Francesca had been holding the flashlight for him under the sink, and she was soaked now too.  Her jeans were wet to the waist.\r\n “Have you all eaten dinner?”  Francesca asked apologetically, and Charles-Edouard said they hadn’t.  She suggested they all go to the nearest pizza parlor, or order Chinese takeout and eat it in her living room.  And then she realized that Charles-Edouard and Marya couldn’t sleep in their own room that night.  Their carpet was soaked through.  She suggested they take her room, and she could sleep on her new living room couch.  Marya resisted at first, but they had no other choice.  And Francesca insisted she didn’t mind sleeping on the couch.\r\n They opted for pizza and went out to dinner.  They were chattering loudly, and all of them looked a mess.  Charles-Edouard was still wearing shorts, Marya had left her boots\r\n on, and Chris and Francesca had put on dry jeans.  Ian said he wanted to go back and splash in the pool in the kitchen and Chris said he couldn’t.  They all had a good time, and went back to the house after dinner, in better spirits, although the kitchen was still a disaster.  The water was slowly draining into the garden through the doors they’d left open, but there were still several inches of water covering the floor, and it had spilled into Marya’s room.  At times like this Francesca wondered if she should sell the house.  If Chris hadn’t been there to turn it off, the water would still be pouring out of the wall.  She had said as much to him on the way back.\r\n “You can always find a plumber, Francesca.  It’s a beautiful old house.  That’s not enough reason to give it up.”\r\n “Yes, it is beautiful, and I love it.  But it’s a lot for me alone.  Financially and every other way.”  Losing the income from one of her tenants had been hard too.  Owning a house, particularly an old one, was a big challenge and a lot of work.  “I’d miss it if I sold it,” she admitted.  “I hope fixing that leak doesn’t cost a fortune.”  Every time she got a little money put aside, some emergency came along and gobbled it up.  The Pac-Man of life.\r\n He walked her back to the living room then, and Marya and Charles-Edouard went upstairs to her room.  She had changed the sheets for them before they all went to dinner.  And Ian went upstairs to watch TV from his bed.  When Chris had put bunk beds in their room he knew Ian would love sleeping on the top bunk.  It wasn’t romantic, but it worked for them and gave him more space in his bedroom than a queen- or king-size bed, which he didn’t need anyway.  He had no one to share it with.  It was just him and Ian.\r\n Chris sat down on the couch next to Francesca to relax.  He was sorry he hadn’t been able to fix the leak in the kitchen, or stop the flood before it turned into a swimming pool.  They both laughed at the vision of Charles-Edouard in his Panama hat and shorts, giving directions, and Ian leaping off the stairs to make a big splash.\r\n “This house would be miserable without all of you,” she said honestly with a grateful\r\n look.\r\n “You don’t get sick of all of us in your space?  I wonder about that sometimes, and if I should get an apartment for me and Ian.  But we’d miss you.  It was kind of an experiment for me in the beginning.  But it really works for us and it’s good for him.  I think he’d be lonely with just me now.”\r\n “And I’d be even lonelier.  Having everyone here puts a little happy craziness in my life.”  It had been an experiment for her too, and a financial necessity, but she loved their communal life.\r\n “Me too,” he said, grinning, and then he turned to look at her.  “You mean a lot to me, Francesca.  I hope you know that.  You’re a wonderful friend.”\r\n “So are you,” she said shyly.  “I couldn’t have gotten through all the Eileen stuff\r\n without you.”  He nodded. "

He had wanted to\r\n ever since the night they were together after Eileen died, but it never seemed like the right time.  He wasn’t sure it was now, but he had done it anyway.  And he was smiling at her.\r\n “I mean why,” she insisted.  “Why did you kiss me?”\r\n “Are you mad at me for doing it?”  he asked, looking worried, and she shook her head.\r\n “Not mad.  Just confused.  I thought you had sworn off relationships for life.”\r\n “I did.  Maybe I just changed my mind.  It was just a kiss, Francesca, not a proposal.  Relax.”\r\n “I think I’m relationship-phobic too.”  She was remembering the conversation she’d had with Avery the day before.\r\n “No, you’re just bruised.  That’s different.  I’m bruised too.  It doesn’t have to be permanent.  It just takes time.  You’ve probably been numb for the last year after your relationship with Todd fell apart.”\r\n “Yes, I have been.  I felt as though something in me had died, and couldn’t come back to life again.”\r\n “It’s not dead.  It’s just asleep,” he reassured her.  “How do you know?”  she asked, looking intrigued.  “I’ll show you,” he said, and kissed her again.  This time she laughed after the kiss.  It\r\n was a nice kiss.  She had liked it a lot.  Maybe she wasn’t so dead after all, and he was right.  “See what I mean?  I think you’re starting to wake up.”  He kissed her again, and she kissed him back this time and melted into his arms, and then she looked worried when they came up for air.  It had been a passionate kiss this time.  They were both heating up, and this was totally unexpected.\r\n “What are we doing, Chris?”  she asked, looking panicked.  “I like you.  I don’t want either of us to get hurt.”\r\n “Maybe we have to take that chance.  No pain, no gain.  Corny expression, but unfortunately true.  I think I’m willing to risk it for you.”\r\n It took some adjustment of her thinking to wrap her mind around the idea.  The great relationship-phobic of all time had come out of his cave.  And so had she.  But it was scary as hell.\r\n “What about Ian?  Would he be upset?”  Francesca asked, looking worried.  “He loves you.  I think he’d be pleased.”  Chris had been thinking about that for a\r\n while.  “I love him too,” she said quietly.  “I was thinking about it today on the way home.\r\n He’s a wonderful boy.”  And then she looked up at Chris and smiled slowly.  “And so are you.”\r\n “You’re not so bad either.  Why don’t we see where this goes.  How about dinner this week?”\r\n “You mean like a date?”  She looked shocked.\r\n “That’s the general idea.  Dinner, you know, all that stuff.  Maybe a kiss goodnight.  How about Tuesday?”\r\n “I suck at dates,” she said, looking nervous again.  “I’ve given them up.”\r\n “Yeah, me too.  But I’m willing to try again with you.”  He had known her for almost nine months, he liked everything about her.  And he’d had almost a year to get comfortable and get to know her, and see her in situations that were real.  He loved what he had seen and knew of her, and she was wonderful with his son.  He couldn’t ask for more than that.  It seemed like a reasonable beginning to him. "

        "text":" She gave most of her cooking utensils to Francesca, and threw a lot of things out.\r\n “It’s amazing what you can collect in a studio apartment in one year,” Marya said, looking around.  There were boxes everywhere, and even a stack of things for Goodwill.  They’d been packing for days.  And Francesca’s mother came to say goodbye to her too.  She was flying to Zurich in two days on her way to Gstaad.\r\n “I’ll call you in Paris the next time I’m there,” she promised.  “And don’t invite me to the wedding if you marry Charles-Edouard,” she teased her.  “I’d be much too jealous.”  The man with the yacht that she’d met in San Francisco over Thanksgiving hadn’t panned out.  She was still looking for number six, but Charles-Edouard wouldn’t have fit the bill either.  Marya was more his type than she was.\r\n “We’re not in any rush,” Marya reassured her.\r\n “What’s happening with Francesca and Chris?”  Thalia asked her as Marya handed her a gift.  It was one of her cookbooks that Thalia had said she wanted and couldn’t find because it was no longer in print.  Thalia thanked her and smiled.\r\n “They seem very happy.  They’re just getting started.  I think it’ll take a while for them to figure it out.  He went through an awful lot with his ex-wife.  And Francesca is very cautious, as you know.”  Marya poured them both a cup of tea.  Thalia was going to miss her.  She was her only conduit into her daughter’s life.  Francesca never told her anything.\r\n They chatted about Paris for a while, and then Thalia stood up and hugged her.  “Take good care of yourself,” Thalia said softly.  “I’m going to miss you too, and not just to fill me in about Francesca.”  She had become a good friend to them all, and Thalia was happy for her.  Marya deserved all the happiness she had found with Charles-Edouard.  She brought joy to a lot of people, and it was nice to see her getting her fair share of it back.  The two women promised to stay in touch.\r\n Thalia left Christmas gifts for Francesca, Chris, and Ian, and she told Francesca she’d call her from Gstaad.  She was leaving for Europe the day before Marya, but she was going to be busy now until she left.\r\n Avery dropped by to say goodbye to Marya too, and leave Christmas gifts for Francesca, Chris, and Ian.  The one for Francesca was enormous, and it was easy to guess what it was.  It was one of her father’s paintings, to replace the five she had sold.\r\n Francesca was thrilled when she saw it that night, and she had Chris help her hang it in the living room, and took down one she had never liked, by an artist she no longer represented.  Chris loved the new one too.  They had told Marya and Charles-Edouard all about the show in Miami, and Chris had admitted to being totally overwhelmed.\r\n “I’ve never seen so much art in one place in my life.”  Marya said she would have loved to see it.  She had always wanted to go to the June show in Basel.  Maybe now, living in Paris, she would.  There were so many things she wanted to do.  She was sad to be leaving, but getting excited as the day approached.  They were planning to spend Christmas in Courchevel with friends of Charles-Edouard.  It was a very fancy ski resort, with some excellent restaurants Marya was anxious to try out.  It was going to be a much more exciting life than the one she’d had on Charles Street for the past year, or in Vermont before that.  And Charles-Edouard moved around Europe a lot.  He said he wanted to take her to Prague and Budapest.\r\n And then the day finally arrived when they had to leave.  It was wrenching, and Francesca and Marya both cried.  Marya could hardly let go of Ian, and Charles-Edouard shepherded her gently toward the door, where a car was waiting to take them to the airport.  She promised to e-mail, and she and Francesca stood for a last moment holding each other tight.\r\n “Take good care,” Marya whispered, and Francesca was crying too hard to talk.\r\n “I’m going to miss you so much,” she said finally through her tears.  This felt like a huge loss to her.  And Ian looked mournful too.\r\n “I’ll see you next summer, and talk to you long before that,” Marya promised as she bent to kiss Ian for a last time.  Chris kept an arm around Francesca and held Ian’s hand as the car finally drove away, and they all went back inside.  The house was going to be deadly quiet without them.  Francesca was glad they were going to Boston in a few days, for Christmas with Chris’s family.  She was still nervous about meeting them, but it was going to be better than staying home in a house that seemed too big now without Marya and Charles-Edouard.\r\n “I think our kitchen just lost five stars,” Chris said, smiling wistfully at her.\r\n “What do you want for dinner?  Pizza or Chinese takeout?”  Francesca asked him, and he laughed, as Ian voted for Chinese.\r\n “I think we’re in trouble.  One of us better learn to cook.”  But Marya had actually taught her a number of her little tricks, if Francesca had time to do them.  And Ian had become an expert at making all kinds of cookies.  Charles-Edouard had left Chris a box of his favorite Cuban cigars.  But the treasures they had left for them were no substitute for the people they had lost.  It was going to be a big adjustment without them, and the house felt empty and sad for the rest of the week.  It was going to be a relief to fly to Boston, and Ian was excited about seeing his cousins.  Francesca was scared stiff.  Chris had been\r\n giving her little hints about his family, that sounded like warnings.  “Conservative, stuffy, not as uptight as they look, religious, Old Guard.”  They sounded like danger signs to her.\r\n “What if your parents hate me?”  she asked Chris in bed, the night before they left.\r\n “Then I won’t see them anymore,” he said matter-of-factly.  “You forget who I was married to before.  She’s not exactly a tough act to follow.  My mother’s a little serious, but my father’s a good guy.  They’ll love you,” he reassured her.\r\n “How is Kim, by the way?”  Francesca asked carefully.  “Did you ever hear from her father?”\r\n “My lawyer says she’s back in rehab.  It won’t last.  It never does.”  He had given up hope.  They had filed a report about her grabbing Ian from school, and she had been strongly reprimanded by the court through her attorney.  They considered it a serious violation.  Even Chris didn’t think she’d do it again.  She hadn’t sent anything to Ian for Christmas.  She always forgot, just like she did his birthday.  There was no room in her life for holidays.  She was too busy either trying to buy drugs, or get off them.  It was a full- time job for her.  Her addiction was her life.\r\n Francesca’s mother had given Ian a cute little leather bomber jacket, and he loved it.  Francesca was touched that she had made the effort.  She bought a silver pen set for Chris, and an evening bag for her, which she wasn’t likely to wear often, but it was pretty.  The bomber jacket for Ian more than made up for it.  And Avery and her father had given him a beautiful drawing set with paints and pastels and pencils and colored pens, and he loved that too.  His new substitute grandparents had done well by him.  And Francesca loved the painting from her father, and went into the living room to see it every day.\r\n She was going to get busy turning Marya’s room into an office for Chris as soon as they got back from Boston.  And he was excited about that.  They were spreading out all over the house.  It was starting to feel like her house again, not having to make space for roommates.  Ian seemed to feel it too  —  he had left a pile of toys in the kitchen, and loved watching TV with his father in Francesca’s bed at night, and climbing into bed with them on Sunday mornings.  Chris and Ian had come home.\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 23\r\n\r\n IT TOOK FRANCESCA hours to pack the night before they went to Boston.  She wasn’t sure what to bring.  Dressy, not so dressy, polite suit for church on Christmas Eve?  Cocktail dress for dinner?  Too sexy?  Too short?  Too low cut?  Too dreary?  She didn‘t want to make a faux pas, and was terrified she would.  Chris told her to forget it and wear jeans, but she knew that would be wrong too.  She expected them to be conservative and stuffy, from everything Chris had said.  She was hoping he had exaggerated a little.  But she was worried.  In the end, she took all the options with her, and had two heavy suitcases for the plane.  Chris groaned when he saw them.\r\n “What did you bring?”  he asked with a look of dismay.\r\n “Everything,” she said, smiling happily.  She had taken no chances and brought it all.  And then she appeared with a third smaller suitcase full of presents for Chris, Ian, and Chris’s parents.  He managed to get it all in the car.  And when they got to the airport, it was a zoo and the flight was late.  It was snowing in Boston.  They didn’t get out till ten o’clock, and they landed in Boston before midnight.  Chris’s father was waiting for them, despite the late hour.  He was a tall man like Chris, but had broader shoulders, a deep voice, and a firm grip as he shook Francesca’s hand.  He looked like the linebacker he had been at Harvard fifty years before.  He gave Ian a warm look and shook his hand, which seemed unusually formal to Francesca, but he seemed like a nice man.  They closed the airport in the snowstorm right after they landed, and the roads were covered as they drove slowly into Boston.  The two men talked football and politics in the car.  Chris had already warned her that he was considered the family black sheep for not going to Harvard and moving to New York.  He didn’t mention their objections to her house.  He said they couldn’t understand why he’d want to be a graphic designer instead of a politician or a banker.  And Kim had been the icing on the cake.  So they didn’t approve of him, whatever they thought of her now.  It made entering their world somewhat dicey for Francesca.\r\n Chris’s parents lived in Cambridge, on Brattle Street, where the president of Harvard lived as well.  All the men in his family had gone to school there, before becoming senators, governors, and presidents.  They were an impressive bunch.  Chris seemed so humble and unassuming, given the family he came from.\r\n When they got to the house, his mother was waiting up for them.  She was a small grandmotherly-looking woman with white hair and gray eyes like Chris.  She was wearing a dark gray wool dress, and a string of pearls.  There was nothing fashionable about her.  She was totally unlike Francesca’s mother.  And she showed Francesca to her room\r\n herself.  Sharing a room with Chris would have been out of the question, even if Ian weren’t there.  Chris’s mother had put Francesca in a guest room as far down the hall as possible from Chris.  Her room assignment made it clear that there was to be no hanky- panky in their house.  Francesca was nervous as Chris winked and left her in her room, after his mother said goodnight.  Francesca wondered if he’d be back later.  And Ian was sleeping in the room with his father.  It was Chris’s boyhood room, and they had a full house, with Chris’s brother and sister and their families and numerous other relatives and their children staying with them.  The house was huge.  Chris had explained who would be there and she couldn’t keep track of any of them, the second cousins, an aunt, his siblings and their children.  It was very confusing, with relatives and in-laws and their children, many of whom had the same first names.  Francesca was sitting in her room, feeling a little dazed, when Chris walked back in, and quickly closed the door.  Francesca had realized by then that his mother hadn’t spoken directly to her, other than to greet her, and say goodnight.\r\n “My mother is still wandering around.  I’ll be back later,” he said quickly, and Francesca rapidly understood that when he was at home, he followed their rules.  Breaking them was not an option, even for him.  It was one of the reasons he lived in New York, and had gone to Stanford on the West Coast.  His parents had considered it treason.\r\n “I take it you can’t sleep here,” she whispered, and he laughed.\r\n “My mother would call the vice squad and have us both thrown out.  She’s a very proper woman.”\r\n “Got it.”  He was thirty-eight years old and not allowed to have a girl in his room.  But Chris knew his way around the system.  They made her family look like wild libertines.  And this was Boston.  Old Boston.  Old Guard.\r\n Half an hour later, the house had gone quiet, and Chris tiptoed back in, barefoot in jeans.  “All set.”  He had his toothbrush with him.  All he had to do was escape back to his own room in the morning by seven, when his mother came down to breakfast, religiously, every morning.  She ran a tight ship.  And kept a close eye on what went on in her house, just as she did at the Vineyard.  Nothing escaped her eagle eye.\r\n “She’s very old-fashioned,” he explained.  He hadn’t mentioned it before, and hadn’t wanted to frighten Francesca.  And as she thought about it, Francesca couldn’t even imagine the chaos Kimberly must have caused there when they were married, doing drugs and getting drunk.  His parents must have loved that.  And they would like even less what she’d been doing lately, recently out of jail, and absconding with their grandson.  Chris said they hated her, and it was easy to see why.  She just hoped they didn’t hate her too.  Francesca was determined to respect them while she was there, even if their rules seemed silly to her.\r\n They spent the night together in her room, and Chris set the alarm on his cell phone\r\n for quarter to seven.  He bounded out of bed the moment it went off, kissed her, put on his jeans and shirt, and ran down the hall to his own room, where Ian was still sleeping.  It was going to be an interesting weekend playing hide and seek in the hall, and musical bedrooms, to avoid his mother discovering them in the same room. "

        "text":"Three years ago, Vanessa Stein\r\n 'and her husband Tom took up\r\n the fast food challenge: they\r\n bought the franchise for a McDonald's restaurant near Leeds.\r\n EARLY MORNING is always an effort for\r\n me.  The alarm goes off at 6.30 a.m. and\r\n then I have 20 minutes' 'thinking time'\r\n to make some mental lists before I get\r\n io up.  I live by lists, actually   —   it's the best\r\n way to keep things organised.\r\n Recently I've been arriving at our\r\n McDonald's restaurant around 8.30 a.m.\r\n I've mastered the computerised accounts\r\n is now so I'm training one of our floor\r\n managers to help me with the\r\n administration.  Eventually this should\r\n give me more time to get involved in\r\n other areas of the business such as\r\n interviewing staff.\r\n Our restaurant is in a retail park\r\n around five miles outside Leeds.  Since\r\n we bought the franchise in 1995, we've\r\n already expanded the seating and now\r\n we're looking to expand the restaurant\r\n itself.  We have to conform to the\r\n McDonald's standards (quality, service,\r\ncleanliness and value) 0} course, but the\r\n restaurant is actually our own business.\r\n We directly employ some 75 staff, order\r\n and pay for supplies (from 'preferred\r\n suppliers'), take care of any\r\n maintenance or refurbishment, arrange\r\n local marketing, and so on.  Around a\r\n quarter of all McDonald's 800 UK\r\n restaurants are franchised.\r\n Buying this franchise was a big move\r\n for us.  Tom (my husband) had to do\r\n nine months' training before we could even be considered for a franchise.  It\r\n paid off though, and we are delighted\r\n with this place - it boasts* what was the\r\n first Drive-Thru in Yorkshire!  - and the\r\n surrounding countryside is truly beautiful.\r\n By 9.30 a.m.  I'm ready for a Bacon £\r\n Egg McMuffin and a cup of tea.  I'll have\r\n a quick chat with our regular breakfast\r\n customers before opening the post.  This brings invoices from suppliers,\r\nmarketing and training information\r\n from McDonald's (they run the training\r\n courses but we pay for our staff to\r\n attend), bookings for parties, or perhaps the monthly report from the 'Mystery\r\n Diner'.\r\n Mystery Diners make monthly checks\r\n on every restaurant and Drive-Thru in\r\n the country.  All aspects are assessed - food quality and presentation,\r\natmosphere, quality and speed of\r\n service, restaurant cleanliness and so\r\n on.  Staff are often commended by\r\n name, so I pass the news on to them and make sure any problems are tackled.\r\n We're currently eighth in the UK league\r\n which is pretty good.\r\n We have an ongoing dialogue with\r\n McDonald's.  A field consultant visits us every two or three weeks, and there are\r\n regular meetings with other franchisees\r\n to share ideas and experience.\r\n Much of my morning is spent\r\n updating computer records.  Tax office queries, training records, payroll, etc,\r\nhave to be organised.  Staff turnover\r\n varies but we can sometimes lose our\r\n casual workers when they go to\r\n university or decide to go travelling.\r\n so There are McDonald's all over the world\r\n now, so their training here really can\r\n open distant doors.\r\n The lunchtime rush* starts around\r\n noon.  On the rare occasions that we're\r\n short staffed (e.g.  flu season), I'll muck\r\n in and serve customers (memories of my\r\n waitressing days at university!) .  I've\r\n even been known to cook fries when\r\n necessary.  As with any small business, one has to be flexible but I think it's also\r\n important to focus your energies where\r\n they are most effective.  For me, this is\r\n behind the scenes admin work.\r\n My own lunch is a salad or chicken  sandwich.  By this time, my office looks\r\n like a bomb site* to the untrained eye.\r\n I've usually divided the masses of\r\n paperwork into piles ready to tackle\r\n them in priority order.  I have to head off around 3 p.m. to\r\n collect my two sons from school so I\r\n generally end up taking work home.  I'll\r\n finish it in the kitchen, listening to Glenn\r\n Miller or the Moody Blues, while also supervising the children's homework,\r\nmusic practice or whatever.\r\n If I'm doing the end-of-month\r\n figures, I generally have to work into the\r\n early hours.  Otherwise I'm in bed any\r\n no time after 10 p.m.  I always have three or\r\n four books on the go, Walter Scott or\r\n Jane Austen for example, and usually\r\n one non-fiction   —   maybe an\r\n autobiography or a political work.   I'm glad to say Tom's snoring* was\r\n lasered away last summer, so now I can\r\n look forward to some undisturbed sleep\r\n before another busy day at the\r\n restaurant.  Now I think of it, I used to have cravings for McDonald's when I\r\n was pregnant.  It must have been a\r\n premonition!"
