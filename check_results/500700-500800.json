        "text":" I was dimly aware that Krin had started giving me the same worried look she’d been giving Ell for the past two days.\r\n I lay wide-eyed for an hour before falling asleep, wondering about Alleg.\r\n When I slept I dreamed of killing them.  In my dream I stalked the forest like grim death, unwavering.\r\n But it was different this time.  I killed Otto, his blood spattering my hands like hot grease.  Then I killed Laren and Josh and Tim.  They moaned and screamed, twisting on the ground.  Their wounds were horrible, but I could not look away.\r\n Then the faces changed.  I was killing Taren, the bearded ex-mercenary in my troupe.  Then I killed Trip.  Then I was chasing Shandi through the forest, my sword naked in my hand.  She was crying out, weeping in fear.  When I finally caught her she clutched at me, knocking me to the ground, burying her face in my chest, sobbing.  “No no no,” she begged.  “No no no.”\r\n I came awake.  I lay on my back, terrified and not knowing where my dream ended and the world began.  After a brief moment I realized the truth.  Ell had crawled from the tent and lay curled against me.  Her face pressed against my chest, her hand grasping desperately at my arm.\r\n “No no,” she choked out.  “No no no no no.”  Her body shook with helpless sobs when she couldn’t say it anymore.  My shirt was wet with hot tears.  My arm was bleeding where she clutched it.\r\n I made consoling noises and brushed at her hair with my hand.  After a long while she quieted and eventually fell into an exhausted sleep, still clinging tightly to my chest.\r\n I lay very still, not wanting to wake her by moving.  My teeth were clenched.  I thought of Alleg and Otto and all the rest.  I remembered the blood and screaming and the smell of burning skin.  I remembered it all and dreamed of worse things I could have done to them.\r\n I never had the nightmares again.  Sometimes I think of Alleg and I smile.\r\n\r\n We made it to Levinshir the next day.  Ell had come to her senses, but remained quiet and withdrawn.  Still, things went more quickly now, especially as the girls decided they had recovered enough to take turns riding Greytail.\r\n We covered six miles before we stopped at midday, with the girls becoming increasingly excited as they began to recognize parts of the countryside.  The shape of hills in the distance.  A crooked tree by the road.\r\n But as we grew closer to Levinshir they grew quiet.\r\n “It’s just over the rise there,” Krin said, getting down off the roan.  “You ride from here, Ell.”\r\n Ell looked from her, to me, to her feet.  She shook her head.\r\n I watched them.  “Are the two of you okay?”\r\n “My father’s going to kill me.”  Krin’s voice was barely a whisper, her face full of serious fear.\r\n “Your father will be one of the happiest men in the world tonight,” I said, then thought it best to be honest.  “He might be angry too.  But that’s only because he’s been scared out of his mind for the last eight days.”\r\n Krin seemed slightly reassured, but Ell burst out crying.  Krin put her arms around her, making gentle sounds.\r\n “No one will marry me,” Ell sobbed.  “I was going to marry Jason Waterson and help him run his store.  He won’t marry me now.  No one will.”\r\n I looked up to Krin and saw the same fear reflected in her wet eyes.  But Krin’s eyes were angry while Ell’s held nothing but despair.\r\n “Any man who thinks that way is a fool,” I said, weighting my voice with all the conviction I could bring to bear. "

        "text":" Above the hill the red kites were still flying round and round. To the east a full moon was rising slowly up into the night sky. Charlie was surprised to see that this moon was an orange-red colour, not the usual yellow-white. He remembered the words, a 'hunter's moon' from when he was a child. Was this a 'hunter's moon'?\r\n \r\n \r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\nVoice of the Beast\r\n\r\nNow I look from my window and see that the light is going from the earth. Tonight the moon will be up for most of the night. Its silver light will fall like soft rain on the woods and trees, on the tops of the hills. Soon I will feel the cold night wind on my face, the air moving through the hairs on my head and arms and back. I will listen to the sound of my feet as they walk on the wet earth and the grass. I will hear the small sounds of animals as they move quickly to get out of my way.\r\nI am going out tonight.\r\nYou ask why? I will tell you.\r\nSome visitors have arrived. I watched them come through the woods. I saw them looking around in the strange new place. They are city people. Here, they are unsure. They move carefully.\r\nThen later they were in the pub. Death has touched her with its cold fingers. I could see that in her eyes. Now she is afraid of the darkness that is following her.\r\nBut also there is something in her face that I know. I have seen that face before, I'm sure. Maybe in Greece? Northern Italy? Maybe in a mountain village somewhere? She interests me. I cannot stop thinking about her. I want her to come with me, to be with me.\r\nI know she is ready to come into my world. But she does not know it herself yet. When I tell her, she will understand what she must do. But I must be careful. The time must be right. . .\r\nFirst, I will go and welcome her, take a present. I must make myself ready.\r\nI walk across the room in the darkness to the fireplace. Daylight makes me weak and ill. The soft silvery light of the moon is what I like. From the wall, I take my belt. It is large and heavy, black and silver. On the silver there is the face of a dog. The dog that sits at the entrance to the Underworld.\r\nI put the belt carefully on the floor in front of the fire. I get down on my knees and put both my hands on the belt. Softly, I repeat the words that I must say. The words are in a language no man or woman can speak. I feel the heat from the fire on my face. In the centre of the fire I watch my thoughts come and go.\r\nAfter a while, after all the words are finished, I stand up and put on the belt. Immediately, my arms and legs start to feel strong. I look towards the blackening sky and give a wild shout. Then, in one great jump, I am gone from the room through the open window.\r\nThe night is cold but I do not feel it. I will not feel it until I become a man again. I touch the belt around the middle of my body. I will know what to do when the moment comes.\r\n \r\n \r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\nThe present\r\n\r\nIt was still dark when Susie woke up. Looking at her clock she saw it was three o'clock in the morning. She lay in bed in the darkness for a while, Charlie's warm body next to her. It was strange that she'd woken so suddenly. Had someone knocked at the door and called her name? Or was it just a dream, as usual?\r\nSuddenly, her body gave a jump. There was a small noise at the bedroom window. Was something trying to get in? The noise came again, and again.\r\n'Charlie, there's something outside,' she said. Her voice seemed very loud to her.\r\n'Um, what? Go back to sleep, there's nothing there,' Charlie said sleepily.\r\nSusie sat up. Outside the wind had become stronger and was blowing noisily through the trees. She climbed out of bed and went to the window. Pulling back the curtain she could see that a tree was moving against the glass. So it was the tree that was making the noise. Outside, in the light of the full moon, the trees and grass were waving and shaking in the wind. Anything could be hiding in the darkness.\r\nSusie put on the lights and walked round the house, looking into every room. There was nothing there, of course. It was just the house itself, maybe, moving in the wind like a boat at sea, which had made the knocking noise. She got back into bed, moved close to Charlie and went back to sleep.\r\nWhen Susie woke the next morning she could see the sunlight through the thin curtains in the bedroom. Charlie was asleep still. 'It must be late,' she thought. She decided to get up, make some breakfast for both of them and bring it back to bed.\r\nDownstairs the fire was nearly out. They'd used all the wood the night before so she decided to get some more from the garage. She pulled on a coat over her nightclothes and put on some shoes. She went to open the door. Strangely, the door didn't move at first. Something seemed to be holding it. She gave it a pull.\r\nAs the door opened, Susie heard herself scream. It was a strange sound, which came from somewhere far inside her. She had never made a noise like that before in her life.\r\n'Charlie, Charlie!' She couldn't move.\r\nThere was the sound of feet on wood as Charlie came running down the stairs.\r\n'What on earth is the matter?' Charlie said.\r\n'Oh my God . . .' He saw the open door and the large and terrible thing on the ground, half in and half out of the kitchen. 'Whatever is that doing there?'\r\n'What is it, Charlie?' Susie found it difficult to speak.\r\n'It's a dead sheep,' Charlie replied, after a few moments. 'Listen, you go back to bed and I'll do something with it,' he added.\r\nThe sheep's body was not pretty to look at. The mouth was open. Charlie couldn't help seeing that the tongue wasn't there. The sheep was cut open from the throat down under the body as far as the back legs. But the cut was clean and there was no blood.\r\nLooking more brave than he felt, Charlie took hold of the two back legs. He pulled the body out of the kitchen, and then across the road outside the house and into the field opposite.\r\n'We ought to tell somebody about it,' he thought. 'The farmer, probably.'\r\nHe asked himself why the sheep was there. Did it just die there? Or did an animal leave it by the door? He tried not to think about who, or what, had put the sheep there. Perhaps there really was a Beast of Brynmawr. Anyway, he felt sick.\r\nHe went back into the house, made a cup of tea and took it up to his wife. Susie was lying in the bed. Her pretty face, with her dark hair cut like a boy's, looked small and white.\r\n'God, Charlie, that was one of the worst things I've ever seen,' she said. 'I heard some strange noises in the night, you know. I thought I heard someone knocking at the door. Do you think someone is trying to play some sort of terrible joke on us?'\r\n'Susie, you mustn't think about it. It was probably just a fox or something. Maybe it decided it would eat its dinner outside our back door. Come on, let's try and forget it. We're here to have a holiday and enjoy ourselves.'\r\n'Well, yes. OK. You're right. I'll try,' Susie said. But she could still see the cold eye of the sheep looking up at her from the kitchen floor.\r\n'Do you think the Beast of. . . ?' she began again.\r\n'No,' Charlie spoke quickly. 'I don't. Forget about it. There's no such thing.'\r\n \r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\nA walk on Brynmawr Hill\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Charlie said, 'Look, it's a wonderful day. Let's go for a walk.'\r\n'OK, then. I'll bring my camera.' Susie tried to sound happy.\r\nThey walked towards the big round hill, which was opposite the house. The day was fine, with a soft autumn sun which came and went behind thick grey clouds. It wasn't cold but there was a wind. They were pleased that they had their jackets.\r\n'Charlie,' Susie said, as they climbed the grassy hillside. 'Do you think this is Brynmawr Hill? You know, the place they talked about in the pub? Where someone saw a werewolf a hundred years ago?'\r\nCharlie smiled. 'Probably. Come on, let's just get to the top,' he said.\r\nFrom the top of the hill, the country looked beautiful. All around they could see the great dark hills of central Wales. The clouds moved slowly across the sky and, on the lower parts of the hills, the sun on the grass looked like watery gold. The light was perfect and Susie put up her camera as fast as she could. She couldn't wait to take some photographs.\r\n'Listen,' Charlie said. 'I'm going to walk on a little way while you're doing that.'\r\n'OK. I'll take a few photos from here, then I'll go over towards that place there.' Susie was looking at a small hill several hundred metres from where they were standing. 'I'll wait for you there,' she said.\r\nCharlie walked quickly, planning to go in a large circle. He looked back, but Susie had disappeared.\r\nThe dead sheep had worried both of them quite a lot. They had not talked about it again. But Charlie could still see the body, lying there, with bits of it missing and one eye open. Also, he realised, because there had been no blood coming from the animal, it had probably died somewhere else. But who, or what, had put it outside their house? He couldn't stop thinking about it. He knew that Susie was finding it hard to forget as well. It wasn't a good start to their holiday.\r\nCharlie stood for a moment on the hill. Far below him, he saw that some sheep were running across one of the fields. He watched as the white animals moved in a group across the large green field. The sounds of the sheep rose up towards him, carried on the wind. Then he saw why they were running: something was chasing them. It stopped to sit and watch the animals. Then it ran on and stopped again. A dog, Charlie thought. Was it possible that a dog had left the sheep at their door? He didn't know much about dogs.\r\nJust then, the clouds above him turned a dark grey, the wind got stronger and rain came down in great fat drops. He'd better go and find Susie.\r\nWhen Charlie arrived at the small hill, Susie was lying down. Charlie was surprised to see that she was asleep. Her camera was on the ground. It looked as if she'd dropped it.\r\n'Susie, Susie!' Charlie shook her. 'What on earth are you doing? It's raining. Your camera's getting wet. Wake up.'\r\nSusie opened her eyes and looked at Charlie. For a moment, Charlie saw something in her eyes that he had never seen before. She was terribly, terribly afraid.\r\n'Are you OK?' he said. 'Why did you go to sleep? Are you OK?'\r\nIt was a few moments before Susie seemed to wake up. Charlie was really worried now. She looked so strange.\r\n'No, I'm not OK. Well, maybe I am. I don't know. I was just standing here, taking a picture of that big tree across there. See? When I looked through the camera, I had the strangest feeling. I tried to move but I just couldn't. I felt as if I was in fast moving water. I couldn't make my legs move forward. Then there was a cold, icy wind and I heard an animal sound, kind of like a wolf and . . . then everything went black. Charlie, I hope there's nothing wrong with me? Am I going mad?'\r\nCharlie looked at her unhappily. The horror of the dead sheep had clearly made her ill.\r\n'Let's get back to the house. We're both wet through and it's terribly cold in this wind. Come on, let's go,' he replied softly.\r\n \r\n \r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\nAn accident\r\n\r\nA few days later, Susie looked at the sitting-room window where the rain water was still running down the glass. They'd been nowhere since that first day. She hadn't wanted to do anything much. She just felt like sitting and reading. Or looking at the fire, putting on the wood, and thinking.\r\n'Charlie, let's go out tonight,' Susie said suddenly. 'Let's go to the pub, shall we?'\r\n'OK, if you want. The Black Dog?' he said. 'We'd better go soon. There's going to be snow later.'\r\n'How do you know that?' Susie asked.\r\n'Heard it on the car radio just now. I was mending that light. You know, that light on the front of the car.'\r\nIt was already dark by the time they started out for the pub. Susie watched her husband as he drove down the little road through the woods. In the yellow of the car lights, she could see he looked serious. He was thinking about something. What was it? Then she thought about who would be in the pub tonight. The farmer, perhaps? Or the man called Richard?\r\n'Oh no. Look. It's starting to snow already!' Charlie said.\r\n'Oh, so it is.' Susie could see little bits of snow caught in the lights of the car. The snow came flying towards them as they drove along. 'It's not very heavy,' she said.\r\nThey turned onto the main road into Llandafydd. Now they were driving into the wind and here the snow was falling fast.\r\n'Perhaps we should go back,' Charlie said. 'It's getting quite thick.'\r\n'It's only a little way now,' Susie said. 'We're nearly there. We could just have a quick drink and then go home.'\r\n'Well, all right, but it's getting difficult to see.' Charlie sounded worried. The snow was coming towards the car in thick straight lines. He moved forward to look through the hole in the snow on the car window.\r\nJust then, Susie saw something. 'Watch out!' she screamed. Something large and dark was moving towards them in the falling snow. It looked like a person, walking along the white line in the middle of the road.\r\nThen the car lights went out.\r\n'What the . . . ?' Charlie said. He tried to stop the car but on the snow it just went faster. There was a crashing, screaming sound of metal as they hit something.\r\nA little while later, Susie opened her eyes. At first everything was black. Her head hurt a little. Then she saw that their car was no longer on the road. They'd hit a tree. The tree seemed to be half inside the car, on Charlie's side. In the darkness, she couldn't see what was Charlie and what was tree. The only sound was the wind in the trees. There was no-one else around.\r\n'Charlie?' Susie touched his arm. There was no answer. 'Charlie?' Was he dead? What should she do? Should she try to get him out of the car? Was the car going to catch fire? Just then a soft noise, almost like a voice, came from the other side of the road and she looked across. A dark thing moved between the trees. She couldn't see if it was a person or an animal. It disappeared quickly.\r\nA small sound came from Charlie. Thank God, he wasn't dead after all. At the same time, car lights appeared along the road. She must get out and get help.\r\nOutside on the road, her legs shook and she couldn't stand. She sat down suddenly in the snow. A Land Rover stopped and a voice said, 'Are you all right?'\r\n'No,' Susie said. 'We need a doctor. My husband's hurt. Badly, I think.' She found that she was crying."

Make sure you remember that for these next couple days.”\r\n “I hate them!”  Ell spat, surprising me with her sudden rage.  “I hate men!”  Her knuckles were white as she gripped Greytail’s reins.  Her face twisted into a mask of anger.  Krin put her arms around Ell, but when she looked at me I saw the sentiment reflected quietly in her dark eyes.\r\n “You have every right to hate them,” I said, feeling more anger and helplessness than ever before in my life.  “But I’m a man too.  Not all of us are like that.”\r\n We stayed there for a while, not more than a half-mile from town.  We had a drink of water and a small bite to settle our nerves.  And then I took them home.\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE Homecoming\r\n Levinshir wasn’t a big town.  Two hundred people lived there, maybe three if you counted the outlying farms.  It was mealtime when we rode in, and the dirt road that split the town in half was empty and quiet.  Ell told me her house was on the far side of town.  I hoped to get the girls there without being seen.  They were worn down and distraught.  The last thing they needed was to face a mob of gossipy neighbors.\r\n But it wasn’t meant to be.  We were halfway through the town when I saw a flicker of movement in a window.  A woman’s voice cried out, “Ell!”  and in ten seconds people began to spill from every doorway in sight.\r\n The women were the quickest, and inside a minute a dozen of them had formed a protective knot around the two girls, talking and crying and hugging each other.  The girls didn’t seem to mind.  Perhaps it was better this way.  A warm welcome might do a lot to heal them.\r\n The men held back, knowing they were useless in situations like this.  Most watched from doorways or porches.  Six or eight came down onto the street, moving slowly and eyeing up the situation.  These were cautious men, farmers and friends of farmers.  They knew the names of everyone within ten miles of their homes.  There were no strangers in a town like Levinshir, except for me.\r\n None of the men were close relatives to the girls.  Even if they were, they knew they wouldn’t get near them for at least an hour, maybe as much as a day.  So they let their wives and sisters take care of things.  With nothing else to occupy them, their attention wandered briefly past the horses and settled onto me.\r\n I motioned over a boy of ten or so.  “Go tell the mayor his daughter’s back.  Run!”  He tore off in a cloud of road dust, his bare feet flying.\r\n The men moved slowly closer to me, their natural suspicion of strangers made ten times worse by recent events.  A boy of twelve or so wasn’t as cautious as the rest and came right up to me, eyeing my sword, my cloak.\r\n “What’s your name?”  I asked him.\r\n “Pete.”\r\n “Can you ride a horse, Pete?”\r\n He looked insulted.  “S’nuf.”\r\n “Do you know where the Walker farm is?”\r\n He nodded.  “ ’Bout north two miles by the millway.”\r\n I stepped sideways and handed him the reins to the roan.  “Go tell them their daughter’s home.  Then let them use the horse to come back to town.”\r\n He had a leg over the horse before I could offer him a hand up.  I kept a hand on the reins long enough to shorten the stirrups so he wouldn’t kill himself on the way there.\r\n"

        "text":"Adapted from the Caltech commencement address given in 1974.\r\n During the Middle Ages there were all kinds of crazy ideas, such\r\n as that a piece of rhinoceros horn would increase potency.  Then a\r\n method was discovered for separating the ideas—which was to try\r\n one to see if it worked, and if it didn't work, to eliminate it.\r\n This method became organized, of course, into science.  And it\r\n developed very well, so that we are now in the scientific age.  It\r\n is such a scientific age, in fact that we have difficulty in\r\n understanding how witch doctors could ever have existed, when\r\n nothing that they proposed ever really worked—or very little of\r\n it did.\r\n But even today I meet lots of people who sooner or later get me\r\n into a conversation about UFOS, or astrology, or some form of\r\n mysticism, expanded consciousness, new types of awareness, ESP, and\r\n so forth.  And I've concluded that it's not a scientific world.\r\n Most people believe so many wonderful things that I decided to\r\n investigate why they did.  And what has been referred to as my\r\n curiosity for investigation has landed me in a difficulty where I\r\n found so much junk that I'm overwhelmed.  First I started out by\r\n investigating various ideas of mysticism, and mystic experiences.\r\n I went into isolation tanks and got many hours of hallucinations,\r\nso I know something about that.  Then I went to Esalen, which is a\r\n hotbed of this kind of thought (it's a wonderful place;  you should\r\n go visit there).  Then I became overwhelmed.  I didn't realize how\r\n much there was.\r\n At Esalen there are some large baths fed by hot springs situated\r\n on a ledge about thirty feet above the ocean.  One of my most\r\n pleasurable experiences has been to sit in one of those baths and\r\n watch the waves crashing onto the rocky shore below, to gaze into\r\n the clear blue sky above, and to study a beautiful nude as she\r\n quietly appears and settles into the bath with me.\r\n One time I sat down in a bath where there was a beautiful girl\r\n sitting with a guy who didn't seem to know her.  Right away I began\r\n thinking, \"Gee!  How am I gonna get started talking to this\r\n beautiful nude babe?\"\r\n I'm trying to figure out what to say, when the guy says to her,\r\nI'm, uh, studying massage.  Could I practice on you?\"\r\n \"Sure,\" she says.  They get out of the bath and she lies down on a\r\n massage table nearby.\r\n I think to myself, \"What a nifty line!  I can never think of\r\n anything like that!\"  He starts to rub her big toe.  \"I think I feel\r\n it, \"he says.  \"I feel a kind of dent—is that the pituitary?\"\r\n I blurt out, \"You're a helluva long way from the pituitary, man!\"\r\n They looked at me, horrified—I had blown my cover—and said, \"It's\r\n reflexology!\"\r\n I quickly closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating.\r\n That's just an example of the kind of things that overwhelm me.  I\r\n also looked into extrasensory perception and PSI phenomena, and the\r\n latest craze there was Uri Geller, a man who is supposed to be able\r\n to bend keys by rubbing them with his finger.  So I went to his\r\n hotel room, on his invitation, to see a demonstration of both\r\n mindreading and bending keys.  He didn't do any mindreading that\r\n succeeded;  nobody can read my mind, I guess.  And my boy held a key\r\n and Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened.  Then he told us it\r\n works better under water, and so you can picture all of us standing\r\n in the bathroom with the water turned on and the key under it, and\r\n him rubbing the key with his finger.  Nothing happened.  So I was\r\n unable to investigate that phenomenon.\r\n But then I began to think, what else is there that we believe?  (And\r\n I thought then about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have\r\n been to cheek on them by noticing that nothing really worked.)  So\r\n I found things that even more people believe, such as that we have\r\n some knowledge of how to educate.  There are big schools of reading\r\n methods and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice,\r\nyou'll see the reading scores keep going down—or hardly going up\r\n in spite of the fact that we continually use these same people to\r\n improve the methods.  There's a witch doctor remedy that doesn't\r\n work.  It ought to be looked into;  how do they know that their\r\n method should work?  Another example is how to treat criminals.  We\r\n obviously have made no progress—lots of theory, but no progress—\r\n in decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to\r\n handle criminals.\r\n Yet these things are said to be scientific.  We study them.  And I\r\n think ordinary people with commonsense ideas are intimidated by\r\n this pseudoscience.  A teacher who has some good idea of how to\r\n teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it\r\n some other way—or is even fooled by the school system into\r\n thinking that her method is not necessarily a good one.  Or a parent\r\n of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or another, feels\r\n guilty for the rest of her life because she didn't do \"the right\r\n thing,\" according to the experts.\r\n So we really ought to look into theories that don't work, and\r\n science that isn't science.\r\n I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are\r\n examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science.  In the\r\n South Seas there is a cargo cult of people.  During the war they saw\r\n airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same\r\n thing to happen now.  So they've arranged to imitate things like\r\n runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a\r\n wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head\r\n like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he's\r\n the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land.  They're\r\n doing everything right.  The form is perfect.  It looks exactly the\r\n way it looked before.  But it doesn't work.  No airplanes land.  So\r\n I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the\r\n apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but\r\n they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.\r\n Now it behooves me, of course, to tell you what they're missing.\r\n But it would be just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea\r\n Islanders how they have to arrange things so that they get some\r\n wealth in their system.  It is not something simple like telling\r\n them how to improve the shapes of the earphones.  But there is one\r\n feature I notice that is generally missing in cargo cult science.\r\n That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying\r\n science in school—we never explicitly say what this is, but just\r\n hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific\r\n investigation.  It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now\r\n and speak of it explicitly.  It's a kind of scientific integrity,\r\na principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of\r\n utter honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards.  For example, if\r\n you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you\r\n think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about\r\n it: other causes that could possibly explain your results;  and\r\n things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other\r\n experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can\r\n tell they have been eliminated.\r\n Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be\r\n given, if you know them.  You must do the best you can—if you know\r\n anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it.  If you\r\n make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then\r\n you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well\r\n as those that agree with it.  There is also a more subtle problem.\r\n When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate\r\n theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that\r\n those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea\r\n for the theory;  but that the finished theory makes something else\r\n come out right, in addition.\r\n In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to\r\n help others to judge the value of your contribution;  not just the\r\n information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or\r\n another.\r\n The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for\r\n example, with advertising.  Last night I heard that Wesson oil\r\n doesn't soak through food.  Well, that's true.  It's not dishonest;\r\n but the thing I'm talking about is not just a matter of not being\r\n dishonest, it's a matter of scientific integrity, which is another\r\n level.  The fact that should be added to that advertising statement\r\n is that no oils soak through food, if operated at a certain\r\n temperature.  If operated at another temperature, they all will—\r\n including Wesson oil.  So it's the implication which has been\r\n conveyed, not the fact, which is true, and the difference is what\r\n we have to deal with.\r\n We've learned from experience that the truth will come out.  Other\r\n experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you\r\n were wrong or right.  Nature's phenomena will agree or they'll\r\n disagree with your theory.  And, although you may gain some\r\n temporary fame and excitement, you will not gain a good reputation\r\n as a scientist if you haven't tried to be very careful in this kind\r\n of work.  And it's this type of integrity, this kind of care not to\r\n fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the\r\n research in cargo cult science.\r\n A great deal of their difficulty is, of course, the difficulty of\r\n the subject and the inapplicability of the scientific method to the\r\n subject.   Nevertheless it should be remarked that this is not the\r\n only difficulty.   That's why the planes didn't land—but they don't\r\n land.\r\n We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of\r\n the ways we fool ourselves.  One example: Millikan measured the\r\n charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and\r\n got an answer which we now know not to be quite right.  It's a\r\n little bit off, because he had the incorrect value for the\r\n viscosity of air.  It's interesting to look at the history of\r\n measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan.  If you\r\n plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little\r\n bigger than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than\r\n that, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, until\r\n finally they settle down to a number which is higher.\r\n Why didn't they discover that the new number was higher right away?\r\n It's a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because\r\n it's apparent that people did things like this: When they got a\r\n number that was too high above Millikan's, they thought something\r\n must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why\r\n something might be wrong.  When they got a number closer to\r\n Millikan's value they didn't look so hard.  And so they eliminated\r\n the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that.\r\n We've learned those tricks nowadays, and now we don't have that\r\n kind of a disease.\r\n But this long history of learning how not to fool ourselves—of\r\n having utter scientific integrity—is, I'm sorry to say, something\r\n that we haven't specifically included in any particular course that\r\n I know of.  We just hope you've caught on by osmosis.\r\n The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are\r\n the easiest person to fool.  So you have to be very careful about\r\n that.  After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other\r\n scientists.  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after\r\n that.\r\n I would like to add something that's not essential to the science,\r\nbut something I kind of believe, which is that you should not fool\r\n the layman when you're talking as a scientist.  I am not trying to\r\n tell you what to do about cheating on your wife, or fooling your\r\n girlfriend, or something like that, when you're not trying to be\r\n a scientist, but just trying to be an ordinary human being.  We'll\r\n leave those problems up to you and your rabbi.  I'm talking about\r\n a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending\r\n over backwards to show how you are maybe wrong, that you ought to\r\n have when acting as a scientist.  And this is our responsibility as\r\n scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.\r\n For example, I was a little surprised when I was talking to a\r\n friend who was going to go on the radio.  He does work on cosmology\r\n and astronomy, and he wondered how he would explain what the\r\n applications of this work were.  \"Well,\" I said, \"there aren't any.\"\r\n He said, \"Yes, but then we won't get support for more research of\r\n this kind.\"  I think that's kind of dishonest.  If you're\r\n representing yourself as a scientist, then you should explain to\r\n the layman what you're doing—and if they don't want to support you\r\n under those circumstances, then that's their decision.\r\n One example of the principle is this: If you've made up your mind\r\n to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should\r\n always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out.  If we only\r\n publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look\r\n good.  We must publish both kinds of results.\r\n I say that's also important in giving certain types of government\r\n advice.  Supposing a senator asked you for advice about whether\r\n drilling a hole should be done in his state;  and you decide it\r\n would be better in some other state.  If you don't publish such a\r\n result, it seems to me you're not giving scientific advice.  You're\r\n being used.  If your answer happens to come out in the direction the\r\n government or the politicians like, they can use it as an argument\r\n in their favor;  if it comes out the other way, they don't publish\r\n it at all.  That's not giving scientific advice.\r\n Other kinds of errors are more characteristic of poor science.  When\r\n I was at Cornell, I often talked to the people in the psychology\r\n department.  One of the students told me she wanted to do an\r\n experiment that went something like this—it had been found by\r\n others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A.\r\n She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to\r\n Y, they would still do A.  So her proposal was to do the experiment\r\n under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.\r\n I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her\r\n laboratory the experiment of the other person—to do it under\r\n condition X to see if she could also get result A, and then change\r\n to Y and see if A changed.  Then she would know that the real\r\n difference was the thing she thought she had under control.\r\n She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her\r\n professor.  And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the\r\n experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time.\r\n This was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general\r\n policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but\r\n only to change the conditions and see what happens.\r\n Nowadays there's a certain danger of the same thing happening, even\r\n in the famous (?)  field of physics.  I was shocked to hear of an\r\n experiment done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator\r\n Laboratory, where a person used deuterium.  In order to compare his\r\n heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen\"\r\n he had to use data from someone else's experiment on light\r\n hydrogen, which was done on different apparatus.  When asked why,\r\nhe said it was because he couldn't get time on the program (because\r\n there's so little time and it's such expensive apparatus) to do the\r\n experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there\r\n wouldn't be any new result.  And so the men in charge of programs\r\n at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money\r\n to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are\r\n destroying—possibly—the value of the experiments themselves,\r\nwhich is the whole purpose of the thing.  It is often hard for the\r\n experimenters there to complete their work as their scientific\r\n integrity demands.\r\n All experiments in psychology are not of this type, however.  For\r\n example, there have been many experiments running rats through all\r\n kinds of mazes, and so on—with little clear result.  But in 1937\r\n a man named Young did a very interesting one.  He had a long\r\n corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and\r\n doors along the other side where the food was.  He wanted to see if\r\n he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from\r\n wherever he started them off.  No.  The rats went immediately to the\r\n door where the food had been the time before.\r\n The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was\r\n so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door\r\n as before?  Obviously there was something about the door that was\r\n different from the other doors.  So he painted the doors very\r\n carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly\r\n the same.  Still the rats could tell.  Then he thought maybe the rats\r\n were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell\r\n after each run.  Still the rats could tell.  Then he realized the\r\n rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement\r\n in the laboratory like any commonsense person.  So he covered the\r\n corridor, and still the rats could tell.\r\n He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded\r\n when they ran over it.  And he could only fix that by putting his\r\n corridor in sand.  So he covered one after another of all possible\r\n"

I knew it was true.\r\n “You’ve got some medicine,” she said.  “You know that proper doctoring means hard choices.”  She gave me an unflinching look.  “We hain’t like other folk.  You burn a man with an iron to stop his bleeding.  You save the mother and lose the babe.  It’s hard, and nobody ever thanks you for it.  But we’re the ones that have to choose.”\r\n She took another slow drink of tea.  “The first few times are the worst.  You’ll get the shakes and lose some sleep.  But that’s the price of doing what needs to be done.”\r\n “There were women too,” I said, the words catching in my throat.\r\n Gran’s eyes flashed.  “They earned it twice as much,” she said, and the sudden, furious anger in her sweet face caught me so completely by surprise that I felt prickling fear crawl over my body.  “A man who would do that to a girl is like a mad dog.  He hain’t hardly a person, just an animal needs to be put down.  But a woman who helps him do it?  That’s worse.  She knows what she’s doing.  She knows what it means.”\r\n Gran put her cup down gently on the table, her expression composed again.  “If a leg goes bad, you cut it off.”  She made a firm gesture with the flat of her hand, then picked up her slice of pudding and began to eat it with her fingers.  “And some folk need killing.  That’s all there is to it.”\r\n\r\n By the time I got myself under control and made it back outside, the crowd in the street had swelled.  The local tavern keeper had rolled a barrel onto his front landing and the air was sweet with the smell of beer.\r\n Krin’s father and mother had ridden back into town on the roan.  Pete was there too, having run back.  He offered up his unbroken head for my inspection and demanded his two pennies for services rendered.\r\n I was warmly thanked by Krin’s parents.  They seemed to be good people.  Most people are if given the chance.  I caught hold of the roan’s reins, and using him as a sort of portable wall I managed to get a moment of relatively private conversation with Krin.\r\n Her dark eyes were a little red around the edges, but her face was bright and happy.  “Make sure you get Lady Ghost,” I said, nodding to one of the horses.  “She’s yours.”  The mayor’s daughter would have a fair dowry no matter what, so I’d loaded Krin’s horse with the more valuable goods, as well as most of the false troupers’ money.\r\n Her expression grew serious as she met my eyes, and again she reminded me of a young Denna.  “You’re leaving,” she said.\r\n I guess I was.  She didn’t try to convince me to stay, and instead surprised me with a sudden embrace.  After kissing me on the cheek she whispered in my ear, “Thank you.”\r\n We stepped away from each other, knowing propriety would only allow so much.  “Don’t sell yourself short and marry some fool,” I said, feeling as if I should say something.\r\n “Don’t you either,” she said, her dark eyes mocking me gently.\r\n I took Greytail’s reins and led her over to where the mayor stood, watching the crowd in a proprietary way.  He nodded as I approached.\r\n I drew a deep breath.  “Is the constable about?”\r\n He raised an eyebrow at this, then shrugged and pointed off into the crowd.  “That’s him there.  He was three-quarters drunk even before you brought our girls home, though.  Don’t know how much use he’ll be to you now.”\r\n “Well,” I said hesitantly.  “I’m guessing someone is going to need to lock me up until you can get word to the azzie off in Temsford.”  I nodded to the small stone building in the center of town.\r\n The mayor looked sideways at me, frowning a bit.  “You want to be locked up?”\r\n “Not particularly,” I admitted.\r\n “You can come and go as you please then,” he said.\r\n “The azzie won’t be happy when he hears,” I said.  “I’d rather not have anyone else go up against the iron law because of something I’ve done.  Aiding in the escape of a murderer can be a hanging offense.”\r\n The big man gave me a long looking over.  His eyes lingered a bit on my sword, the worn leather of my boots.  I could almost feel him noticing the lack of any serious wounds despite the fact that I’d just killed half a dozen armed men.\r\n “So you’d let us just lock you up?”  he asked.  “Easy as that?”\r\n I shrugged.\r\n He frowned again, then shook his head as if he couldn’t make sense of me.  “Well aren’t you just as gentle as a lamb?”  he said wonderingly.  “But no.  I won’t lock you up.  You haven’t done anything less than proper.”\r\n “I broke that boy’s arm,” I said.\r\n “Hmm,” he rumbled darkly.  “Forgot about that.”  He reached into his pocket and brought out ha’penny.  He handed it to me.  “Much obliged.”\r\n I laughed as I put it in my pocket.\r\n “Here’s my thought,” he said.  “I’ll head over and see if I can find the constable.  Then I’ll explain to him we’ve got to lock you up.  If you’ve slipped off in the middle of this confusion, we wouldn’t hardly be aiding in the escape, would we?”\r\n “It would be negligence in maintenance of the law,” I said.  “He might take a few lashes for it, or lose his post.”\r\n “Shouldn’t come to that,” the mayor said.  “But if it does, he’ll be happy to do it.  He’s Ellie’s uncle.”  He looked out at the crowd on the street.  “Will fifteen minutes be enough for you to slip off in all the confusion?”\r\n “If it’s all the same to you,” I said.  “Could you say I disappeared in a strange and mysterious way when your back was turned?”\r\n He laughed at this.  “Don’t see why not.  You need more than fifteen minutes on account of it being mysterious and all?”\r\n “Ten should be a great plenty,” I said as I unpacked my lute case and travelsack from Greytail and handed the mayor the reins.  “You’d be doing me a favor if you took care of him until Bil is up and about,” I said.\r\n “You leaving your horse?”  he asked.\r\n “He’s just lost his.”  I shrugged.  “And we Ruh are used to walking.  I wouldn’t know what to do with a horse, anyway,” I said half-honestly.\r\n The big man gripped the reins and gave me a long look, as if he wasn’t quite sure what to make of me.  “Is there anything we can do for you?”  he asked at last.\r\n “Remember it was bandits who took them,” I said as I turned to leave.  “And remember it was one of the Edema Ruh who brought them back.”\r\n CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX Interlude — Close to Forgetting\r\n Kvothe held up a hand to Chronicler.  “Let’s take a moment, shall we?”  He looked around the dark inn.  “I’ve let myself get a little caught up in the story.  I should tend to a few things before it gets any later.”\r\n The innkeeper came stiffly to his feet and stretched.  He lit a candle at the fireplace and moved around the inn, lighting the lamps one by one, driving back the dark by slow degrees.\r\n"

If he relaxed any of his conditions,\r\nthe rats could tell.\r\n Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one\r\n experiment.  That is the experiment that makes rat-running\r\n experiments sensible, because it uncovers the clues that the rat\r\n is really using—not what you think it's using.  And that is the\r\n experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in\r\n order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with\r\n rat-running.\r\n I looked into the subsequent history of this research.  The next\r\n experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young.\r\n They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on\r\n sand, or being very careful.  They just went right on running rats\r\n in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries\r\n of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn't\r\n discover anything about the rats.  In fact, he discovered all the\r\n things you have to do to discover something about rats.  But not\r\n paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic of\r\n cargo cult science.\r\n Another example is the ESP experiments of Mr. Rhine, and other\r\n people.  As various people have made criticisms—and they themselves\r\n have made criticisms of their own experiments—they improve the\r\n techniques so that the effects are smaller, and smaller, and\r\n smaller until they gradually disappear.  All the parapsychologists\r\n are looking for some experiment that can be repeated—that you can\r\n do again and get the same effect—statistically, even.  They run a\r\n million rats no, it's people this time they do a lot of things and\r\n get a certain statistical effect.  Next time they try it they don't\r\n get it any more.  And now you find a man saying that it is an\r\n irrelevant demand to expect a repeatable experiment.  This is\r\n science?\r\n This man also speaks about a new institution, in a talk in which\r\n he was resigning as Director of the Institute of Parapsychology.\r\n And, in telling people what to do next, he says that one of the\r\n things they have to do is be sure they only train students who have\r\n shown their ability to get PSI results to an acceptable extent—\r\n not to waste their time on those ambitious and interested students\r\n who get only chance results.  It is very dangerous to have such a\r\n policy in teaching—to teach students only how to get certain\r\n results, rather than how to do an experiment with scientific\r\n integrity.\r\n So I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere\r\n where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have\r\n described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain\r\n your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,\r\nto lose your integrity.  May you have that freedom."

We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.  We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.  Some day I will show the world what it is;  and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.\"\r\n\r\n \"I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you.  It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?\"\r\n\r\n The painter considered for a few moments.  \"He likes me,\" he answered after a pause;  \"I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him dreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said.  As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.\"\r\n\r\n \"Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,\" murmured Lord Henry.  \"Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.  The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal.  And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.  It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.  I think you will tire first, all the same.  Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something.  You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.  The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.  What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.\"\r\n\r\n \"Harry, don't talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.  You can't feel what I feel.  You change too often.\"\r\n\r\n \"Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\"  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.  There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.  How pleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other people's emotions were! —much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him.  One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends—those were the fascinating things in life.  He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.  Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses.  Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.  The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.  It was charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him.  He turned to Hallward and said, \"My dear fellow, I have just remembered.\"\r\n\r\n \"Remembered what, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n \"Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.\"\r\n\r\n \"Where was it?\"  asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\r\n\r\n \"Don't look so angry, Basil.  It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's.  She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.  I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking.  Women have no appreciation of good looks;  at least, good women have not.  She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature.  I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.  I wish I had known it was your friend.\"\r\n\r\n \"I am very glad you didn't, Harry.\"\r\n\r\n \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't want you to meet him.\"\r\n\r\n \"You don't want me to meet him?\"\r\n\r\n \"No.\"\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,\" said the butler, coming into the garden.\r\n\r\n \"You must introduce me now,\" cried Lord Henry, laughing.\r\n\r\n The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.  \"Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.\"  The man bowed and went up the walk.\r\n\r\n Then he looked at Lord Henry.  \"Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,\" he said.  \"He has a simple and a beautiful nature.  Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him.  Don't spoil him.  Don't try to influence him.  Your influence would be bad.  The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it.  Don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him.  Mind, Harry, I trust you.\"  He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\r\n\r\n \"What nonsense you talk!\"  said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house."

How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and Igraine his wife, and of their departing suddenly again.\r\n\r\n IT befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that held war against him long time.  And the duke was called the Duke of Tintagil.  And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him to bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.\r\n\r\n So when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of great lords they were accorded both.  The king liked and loved this lady well, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have lain by her.  But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent unto the king.  And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I suppose that we were sent for that I should be dishonoured;  wherefore, husband, I counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride all night unto our own castle.  And in like wise as she said so they departed, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware of their departing.  All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing so suddenly, he was wonderly wroth.  Then he called to him his privy council, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his wife.\r\n\r\n Then they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great charge;  and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your best, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him.  So that was done, and the messengers had their answers;  and that was this shortly, that neither he nor his wife would not come at him.\r\n\r\n Then was the king wonderly wroth.  And then the king sent him plain word again, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within forty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath.\r\n\r\n When the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and garnished two strong castles of his, of the which the one hight Tintagil, and the other castle hight Terrabil.  So his wife Dame Igraine he put in the castle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of Terrabil, the which had many issues and posterns out.  Then in all haste came Uther with a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of Terrabil.  And there he pight many pavilions, and there was great war made on both parties, and much people slain.  Then for pure anger and for great love of fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick.  So came to the king Uther Sir Ulfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was sick.  I shall tell thee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for love of fair Igraine, that I may not be whole.  Well, my lord, said Sir Ulfius, I shall seek Merlin, and he shall do you remedy, that your heart shall be pleased.  So Ulfius departed, and by adventure he met Merlin in a beggar's array, and there Merlin asked Ulfius whom he sought.  And he said he had little ado to tell him.  Well, said Merlin, I know whom thou seekest, for thou seekest Merlin;  therefore seek no farther, for I am he;  and if King Uther will well reward me, and be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire, that shall be his honour and profit more than mine;  for I shall cause him to have all his desire.  All this will I undertake, said Ulfius, that there shall be nothing reasonable but thou shalt have thy desire.  Well, said Merlin, he shall have his intent and desire.  And therefore, said Merlin, ride on your way, for I will not be long behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.  How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and how by the mean of Merlin he lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.\r\n\r\n THEN Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came to King Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin.  Where is he?  said the king.  Sir, said Ulfius, he will not dwell long.  Therewithal Ulfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion's door.  And then Merlin was bound to come to the king.  When King Uther saw him, he said he was welcome.  Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart every deal;  so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to fulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire.  Then the king was sworn upon the Four Evangelists.  Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: the first night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her, and when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish there as I will have it;  for it shall be your worship, and the child's avail, as mickle as the child is worth.  I will well, said the king, as thou wilt have it.  Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall lie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil;  and ye shall be like the duke her husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the duke's, and I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight of the duke's.  But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her men, but say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on the morn till I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten miles hence;  so this was done as they devised.  But the duke of Tintagil espied how the king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that night he issued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed the king's host.  And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was slain or ever the king came at the castle of Tintagil.\r\n\r\n So after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than three hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur, and on day came Merlin to the king, and bade him make him ready, and so he kissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste.  But when the lady heard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead or ever King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be that lay with her in likeness of her lord;  so she mourned privily and held her peace.  Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord betwixt the lady Igraine and him;  the king gave them leave, for fain would he have been accorded with her.  So the king put all the trust in Ulfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king and she met together.  Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a lusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady;  it were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her his queen.  Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king.  And anon, like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and so in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and joy.\r\n\r\n And King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was Gawaine's mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.  All this was done at the request of King Uther.  And the third sister Morgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so much that she was a great clerk of necromancy.  And after she was wedded to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain's le Blanchemain's father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.  Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture.\r\n\r\n THEN Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after within half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by the faith she owed to him, whose was the body;  then she sore abashed to give answer.  Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and I shall love you the better, by the faith of my body.  Sir, said she, I shall tell you the truth.  The same night that my lord was dead, the hour of his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle of Tintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two knights with him in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus, and so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do with my lord, and the same night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon me.  That is truth, said the king, as ye say;  for it was I myself that came in the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of the child;  and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin's counsel.  Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father of her child.\r\n\r\n Soon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for the nourishing of your child.  As thou wilt, said the king, be it.  Well, said Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing true man and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your child, and his name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood in many parts in England and Wales;  and this lord, Sir Ector, let him be sent for, for to come and speak with you, and desire him yourself, as he loveth you, that he will put his own child to nourishing to another woman, and that his wife nourish yours.  And when the child is born let it be delivered to me at yonder privy postern unchristened.  So like as Merlin devised it was done.  And when Sir Ector was come he made fiaunce to the king for to nourish the child like as the king desired;  and there the king granted Sir Ector great rewards.  Then when the lady was delivered, the king commanded two knights and two ladies to take the child, bound in a cloth of gold, and that ye deliver him to what poor man ye meet at the postern gate of the castle.  So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and so he bare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made an holy man to christen him, and named him Arthur;  and so Sir Ector's wife nourished him with her own pap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.  Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.\r\n\r\n THEN within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady.  And in the meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon his men, and slew many of his people.  Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory.  So it was done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an horse-litter with a great host towards his enemies.  And at St. Albans there met with the king a great host of the North.  And that day Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther's men overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant to flight.  And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy of his victory.  And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days and three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best.  There is none other remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will.  But look ye all barons be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak.  So on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king;  then Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance?  Then Uther Pendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God's blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and worshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing;  and therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as longed to a king.  Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow, and all the barons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V. How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a sword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.\r\n\r\n THEN stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that was mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king.  Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of cursing;  and for this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night, that he would of his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to be king of mankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm.  So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all the lords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even unto London.  And many of them made them clean of their life, that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God.  So in the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul's or not the French book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day in the church for to pray.  And when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone;  and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus: — Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England.  Then the people marvelled, and told it to the Archbishop.  I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your church and pray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the high mass be all done.  So when all masses were done all the lords went to behold the stone and the sword.  And when they saw the scripture some assayed, such as would have been king.  But none might stir the sword nor move it.  He is not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but doubt not God will make him known.  But this is my counsel, said the Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame, and they to keep this sword.  So it was ordained, and then there was made a cry, that every man should assay that would, for to win the sword.  And upon New Year's Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that all knights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this was ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the Archbishop trusted that God would make him known that should win the sword.\r\n\r\n So upon New Year's Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the jousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was his nourished brother; "

So as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for he had left it at his father's lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur for to ride for his sword.  I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to see the jousting.  Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will ride to the churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day.  So when he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse to the stile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there, for they were at the jousting.  And so he handled the sword by the handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his horse and rode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and delivered him the sword.  And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the sword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said: Sir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this land.  When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned again and came to the church, and there they alighted all three, and went into the church.  And anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he came to that sword.  Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to me.  How gat ye this sword?  said Sir Ector to Arthur.  Sir, I will tell you.  When I came home for my brother's sword, I found nobody at home to deliver me his sword;  and so I thought my brother Sir Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain.  Found ye any knights about this sword?  said Sir Ector.  Nay, said Arthur.  Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur, I understand ye must be king of this land.  Wherefore I, said Arthur, and for what cause?  Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so;  for there should never man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be rightwise king of this land.  Now let me see whether ye can put the sword there as it was, and pull it out again.  That is no mastery, said Arthur, and so he put it in the stone;  wherewithal Sir Ector assayed to pull out the sword and failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI.  How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times.\r\n\r\n Now assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay.  And anon he pulled at the sword with all his might;  but it would not be.  Now shall ye assay, said Sir Ector to Arthur.  I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily.  And therewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay.  Alas, said Arthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me?  Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so;  I was never your father nor of your blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were.  And then Sir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish him, and by whose commandment, and by Merlin's deliverance.\r\n\r\n Then Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not his father.  Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye are king?  Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for ye are the man in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good lady and mother your wife, that as well as her own hath fostered me and kept.  And if ever it be God's will that I be king as ye say, ye shall desire of me what I may do, and I shall not fail you;  God forbid I should fail you Sir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but that ye will make my son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of all your lands.  That shall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith of my body, that never man shall have that office but he, while he and I live Therewithal they went unto the Archbishop, and told him how the sword was achieved, and by whom;  and on Twelfth-day all the barons came thither, and to assay to take the sword, who that would assay.  But there afore them all, there might none take it out but Arthur;  wherefore there were many lords wroth, and said it was great shame unto them all and the realm, to be overgoverned with a boy of no high blood born.  And so they fell out at that time that it was put off till Candlemas and then all the barons should meet there again;  but always the ten knights were ordained to watch the sword day and night, and so they set a pavilion over the stone and the sword, and five always watched.  So at Candlemas many more great lords came thither for to have won the sword, but there might none prevail.  And right as Arthur did at Christmas, he did at Candlemas, and pulled out the sword easily, whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and put it off in delay till the high feast of Easter.  And as Arthur sped before, so did he at Easter;  yet there were some of the great lords had indignation that Arthur should be king, and put it off in a delay till the feast of Pentecost.\r\n\r\n Then the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin's providence let purvey then of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther Pendragon loved best and most trusted in his days.  And such knights were put about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius, Sir Brastias.  All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day and night, till the feast of Pentecost."

The waters of the lake rippled and sparkled in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n \"I wish,\" said Wilfried, softly gritting his teeth, \"I wish that instead of this peaceful scene we could see here properly and with our own eyes the kingdoms of the earth in all their glory.  But let's look at them in our mind's eye.  Let's think of those swarming masses, whether smartly dressed in all their finery, or in rags.  Exclude nobody.\r\n\r\n Do you recognize their complete barbarity?  Not the brave, bold, picturesque, happy barbarity of the young, but a sinister, sullen, churlish, ugly savagery which will kill everything and create nothing.  You will at least be amazed by their mass - for their mass is indeed enormous!  Look with wonder at its neat arrangement into three parts:\r\n\r\nAt their head, the motley tribe of fools.  They lead in everything, carrying the keys, opening the doors, inventing phrases, wailing when they are wrong and assuring you that they would never have believed that this or that could happen.\r\n\r\n Next, look at the scoundrels: They are everywhere - at the sides, at the front, and at the back.  They run about, agitatedly working themselves up and their sole purpose is to stop anything from being settled, until they have settled themselves.  But what's the point of their being settled?  Hardly has one of their gang declared that it has had its fill, then famished swarms of others rush up to take over.\r\n\r\n And now look at the brutes.  The fools have unleashed them.  And the scoundrels are herding them in countless flocks\r\n\r\n You might well ask what I make of such pandemonium.  I can make of it only what it is: Stupidity, destruction, and death!\r\n\r\n I can indeed perceive merely a world of insects, differing in size and species, armed with saws, pincers, drills, and other tools for ruin, intent on bringing down morals, rights, laws, and customs, all that I have loved and respected.  A world which burns cities, razes monuments, and now spurns books, music, pictures, substituting for all of them potatoes, underdone beef, and rotten wine.\r\n\r\n Would you want to spare such a rabble, If there was at hand a sure way of destroying them?\r\n\r\n That's for you to decide.\r\n\r\n As far as I'm concerned: Lend me for one moment the Thunderbolts of Jupiter, and I will destroy however much is necessary of this irresponsible mass of brutes - they're totally incapable of discrimination, I don't see that they have any soul other than is scarcely their fault.\r\n\r\n Nor should we show any excess of severity towards the scoundrels.  I can hardly tell you that they are the salt of the earth, but they are its brine.  We can, at a pinch, turn them into something, and so long as we hang a few of them from time to time, the rest can be employed, if not honestly, then at least usefully.  Moreover, we have to admit that our planet produces them naturally and without excessive effort.  In spite of itself, the world could never either get ride of them or even perhaps do without them\r\n\r\n As for the fools, I would be pitiless!  They are the vain and bloody offers, the sole and detestable agents of universal decay and my thunderbolts would rain down mercilessly upon their perverted brains.  No, such a gang do not deserve to live.  Indeed an ordered world cannot survive so long as such croaking vermin exist.  The eras of splendor and creativity were those when such reptiles did not crawl upon the steps of power."

        "text":"CHAPTER 1\r\n The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink- flowering thorn.\r\n From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs;  and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.  The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\r\n In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and\r\n gave rise to so many strange conjectures.\r\n As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.\r\n \"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,\" said Lord Henry languidly.  \"You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.  The Grosvenor is really the only place.\"\r\n \"I don't think I shall send it anywhere,\" he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford.  \"No, I won't send it anywhere.\"\r\n Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.  \"Not send it anywhere?  My dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps you painters are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.  As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.  A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.\"\r\n \"I know you will laugh at me,\" he replied, \"but I really can't exhibit it.  I have put too much of myself into it.\"\r\n Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.  \"Yes, I knew you would;  but it is quite true, all the same.\"\r\n \"Too much of yourself in it!
