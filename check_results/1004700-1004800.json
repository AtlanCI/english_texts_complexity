        "text":"Can Quiet, Efficient 'Space Elevators' Really Work?\r\n\r\n Is it time to push the \"up\" button on the space elevator?\r\n\r\n A space elevator consisting of an Earth-anchored tether that extends 62,000 miles (100,000 kilometers) into space could eventually provide routine, safe, inexpensive and quiet access to orbit, some researchers say.\r\n\r\n A new assessment of the concept has been pulled together titled \"Space Elevators: An Assessment of the Technological Feasibility and the Way Forward.\"  The study was conducted by a diverse collection of experts from around the world under the auspices of the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA).\r\n\r\n The study's final judgment is twofold: A space elevator appears possible, with the understanding that risks must be mitigated through technological progress…and a space elevator infrastructure could indeed be built via a major international effort.\r\n\r\n The tether serving as a space elevator would be used to economically place payloads and eventually people into space using electric vehicles called climbers that drive up and down the tether at train-like speeds.  The rotation of the Earth would keep the tether taut and capable of supporting the climbers.\r\n\r\n Rooted in history\r\n\r\n The notion of a beanstalk-like space elevator is rooted in history. \r\n\r\n Many point to the ahead-of-its-time \"thought experiment\" published in 1895 by Russian space pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.  He suggested creation of a free-standing tower reaching from the surface of Earth to the height of geostationary orbit (GEO;  22,236 miles, or 35,786 km).\r\n\r\n Over the last century or so, writers, scientists, engineers and others have helped finesse the practicality of the space elevator.  And the new study marks a major development in the evolution of the idea, says  IAA president Gopalan Madhavan Nair.  [10 Sci-Fi Predictions That Came True]\r\n\r\n \"No doubt all the space agencies of the world will welcome such a definitive study that investigates new ways of transportation with major changes associated with inexpensive routine access to GEO and beyond,\" Nair writes in the new study's preface.\r\n\r\n \"There is no doubt that the Academy, due to this study, will contribute to advancing international consensus and awareness on the need to search and develop new ways of transportation in conducting space exploration while preserving our universe in the same way we are now trying to preserve our planet Earth,\" Nair adds.\r\n\r\n Elevator operator\r\n\r\n While it's always tricky to predict the future study lead editor Peter Swan told Space.com that space elevators are more than just a science-fiction fantasy.  \"The results of our study are encouraging,\" he said.\r\n\r\n Swan's view is fortified by the late science fact/fiction soothsayer, Arthur C. Clarke, who stated in 2003: \"The space elevator will be built ten years after they stop laughing…and they have stopped laughing!\"\r\n\r\n Swan is chief engineer at SouthWest Analytic Network, Inc. in Paradise Valley, Ariz., and is focused on developing and teaching innovative approaches to \"new space\" development.  He's also head elevator operator of the International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC), which has organizational members in the United States, Europe and Japan and individual members from around the world.\r\n\r\n ISEC's goal is nothing short of getting a lengthy space elevator built.\r\n\r\n \"The question is when, of course,\" Swan said.  \"But the point is that the technologies are progressing in a positive manner, such that we who work in it believe that there will be space elevators.\"\r\n\r\n Pacing technologies\r\n\r\n Swan said the giggle factor regarding space elevators is \"down significantly\" given work carried out over the last decade by a global network of individuals and groups.  \"Still, there are many, many issues and I certainly would not want to say that it's not a challenging project.\"\r\n\r\n The IAA appraisal delves into a number of issues, such as: Why build a space elevator?  Can it be done?  How would all the elements fit together to create a system of systems?  And what are the technical feasibilities of each major space elevator element?\r\n\r\n Two technologies are pacing the development of the space elevator, Swan said.\r\n\r\n Producing an ultra-strong space tether and other space elevator components, Swan said, has been advanced by the invention of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that are 1,000 times better in strength-to-weight ratio than steel.  The good news, he said, is that CNTs are being developed with billions of dollars by nanotechnology, electronics, optics, and materials specialists.\r\n\r\n Similarly, lightweight solar cells \"are coming along nicely,\" Swan said.  \"That's an industry that the space elevator people are watching, too.  We're not going to drive it, but we can certainly watch it and appreciate the advances.\"\r\n\r\n Money, motivation and desire\r\n\r\n Regarding who would erect a space elevator, Swan said the study dives into details.  A primarily commercial effort with some government support is possible, as is a public-private enterprise, or an entirely governmental project.\r\n\r\n \"All three are viable.  Any one of them could work.  It's a matter of money, motivation and the desire to do it,\" Swan said, though the study centers on commercial development of the space elevator.  \"It's conceivable all three could be going on at the same time.\"\r\n\r\n The study team was encouraged by the future, though Swan and others acknowledge there are many questions left to be studied.  Indeed, another evaluation of the space elevator idea 10 years hence would be worthwhile, Swan said.\r\n\r\n Erasing the rocket equation\r\n\r\n Are there any technical, political or policy \"showstoppers\" that could prevent the space elevator from becoming a reality?\r\n\r\n \"You're asking the wrong guy,\" Swan responded.  \"I am an optimist.  I have always had the attitude that good people, motivated by good rationale working hard will make it work.  My guess is that space elevators are going to work, whether it's by 2035, 2060 or even 2100.\"\r\n\r\n Swan said the rationale is moving beyond the \"rocket equation,\" which involves tossing away 94 percent of a rocket's mass sitting on the launch pad.\r\n\r\n \"And it still costs a lot of stinking money to get up there,\" he said.\r\n\r\n The space elevator opens everything up, Swan said.  It's a soft ride, a week to GEO.  There are no restrictions on the size or shape of payloads.\r\n\r\n \"People will laugh and ask why did we ever do space rockets…it's a dumb idea,\" Swan said.  \"Space elevators are the answer if we can make them work.  Why would you do anything else?\""

        "text":"NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has put it in reverse, completing its first-ever long backward drive.\r\n\r\n The 1-ton Curiosity rover covered 329 feet (100 meters) in reverse on Tuesday (Feb.  18).  The maneuver  —  carried out over relatively smooth and benign ground  —  was designed to test out a strategy for reducing wear on the robot's six metal wheels, which have accumulated dings and holes at an increasing rate over the last few months, NASA officials said.\r\n\r\n \"We wanted to have backwards driving in our validated toolkit because there will be parts of our route that will be more challenging,\" Curiosity project manager Jim Erickson, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement.\r\n\r\n Curiosity is currently embarked on a long trek to the base of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles (5.5 kilometers) into the Martian sky.  The rover recently crossed a sand dune to enter a region called Moonlight Valley, which photos taken from orbit suggested would give Curiosity's wheels a bit of a break.\r\n\r\n That landscape assessment appears to be on the money, team members said.\r\n\r\n \"After we got over the dune, we began driving in terrain that looks like what we expected based on the orbital data,\" Erickson said.  \"There are fewer sharp rocks, many of them are loose, and in most places there's a little bit of sand cushioning the vehicle.\"\r\n\r\n Curiosity is expected to arrive at the base of Mount Sharp around June or so.  Once there, it will climb up through the mountain's lower reaches, which contain a history of Mars' changing environmental conditions over the eons.\r\n\r\n But the rover will stop to do some science work along the way to Mount Sharp.  The mission team plans to study  —  and possibly drill into  —  rocks at a site they've dubbed Kimberley, which lies about 0.67 miles (1.1 km) ahead on the route.\r\n\r\n Curiosity's handlers will further refine the rover's path while it's conducting science work at Kimberley, using orbital imagery to pick the best way forward.\r\n\r\n \"We have changed our focus to look at the big picture for getting to the slopes of Mount Sharp, assessing different potential routes and different entry points to the destination area,\" Erickson said.  \"No route will be perfect;  we need to figure out the best of the imperfect ones.\"\r\n\r\n Curiosity landed in August 2012 to determine if the Red Planet has ever been capable of supporting microbial life.  Mission scientists have already answered this question in the affirmative, announcing last year that an area near the rover's landing site called Yellowknife Bay was indeed habitable billions of years ago.\r\n\r\n Curiosity has now put a total of 3.24 miles (5.21 km) on its odometer since touching down.  Its older, smaller cousin Opportunity, by comparison, has driven 24.07 miles (38.74 km) during its 10 years on Mars.\r\n\r\n Opportunity holds the American distance record for off-planet driving.  The overall mark was set by the Soviet Union's Lunokhod 2 rover, which travelled 26 miles (42 km) on the moon in 1973."

        "text":"A romance scam is a confidence trick involving feigned romantic intentions towards a victim, gaining their affection, and then using that goodwill to commit fraud.  Fraudulent acts may involve access to the victims' money, bank accounts, credit cards, passports, e-mail accounts, or national identification numbers or by getting the victims to commit financial fraud on their behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n Scammers post profiles, using stolen photographs of attractive persons, asking for others to contact them.  Letters are exchanged between the scammer and victim until the scammer feels they have groomed the victim enough to ask for money.  This might be for requests for gas money or bus and airplane tickets to travel to visit the victim, medical expenses, education expenses etc.  There is usually the promise that the fictitious character will one day join the victim in the victim's country.  The scam usually ends when the victim realizes they are being scammed or stops sending money.  Victims can be highly traumatized by this and are often very embarrassed and ashamed when they learn they have become a victim of a scam and that the romance was a farce.\r\n Internet\r\n\r\n Scammers post profiles on dating websites to groom new victims.  Upon finding victims, scammers lure them to more private means of communication, (such as providing an e-mail address) to allow for fraud to occur.\r\n\r\n Common variations[edit]\r\n\r\n Narratives used to extract money from the victims of romantic scams include the following:\r\nThe scammer says their boss paid them in postal money orders.  The scammer wants the mark to cash the money orders, and then wire money to the scammer.  The forged money orders leave the banks to incur debts against the victims. [2]\r\n The scammer says they need the mark to send money to pay for a passport. [2]\r\n The scammer says they require money for flights to the victim's country because of being left there by a step-parent, or husband/wife, or because they are just tired of living in their country[3] and somehow never comes, or says that they are being held against their will by immigration authorities, who demand bribes. [4]\r\n The scammer says they are being held against their will for failure to pay a bill or requires money for hospital bills. [3]\r\n The scammer says they need the money to pay for the phone bills in order to continue communicating with the victim.\r\n The scammer says they need the money for their or their parents' urgent medical treatment.\r\n The scammer says they need the money to successfully graduate before they can visit the victim.\r\n The scammer offers a job, often to people in a poor country, on payment of a registration fee.  These are particularly common at African dating sites.\r\n A new variation is where the scammer contacts the victim claiming to be a model working in the victim's city for only a couple of weeks and found the victim on the \"yahoo directory\".  The scammer will invite the victim into a chat session, where a rapport is built, and pictures are given - usually of a pornographic nature.  The scammer will then ask if the victim wants to meet, and when the victim says yes, he is told that he will need to obtain a \"security ID pass\", or in at least one specific case, an \"EMP\", or \"Exclusive Model Pass\".  This involves logging onto a number of webcam sites, all of which require credit card information.  The ID code is not sent, and the victim is then told he can get one by sending money ($200 - $500) to the models' \"manager\" in the Philippines. "

        "text":" For some reason it's Struck who sort of specializes in this story and never misses a chance to tell new E.T.A.s the tale of Clipperton v. Reat.  Clipperton's an OK player, nothing spectacular but also not like absurdly out of place at a regional-grade tourney;  but Reat is at fifteen seasoned and high-ranked, and the third seed at Hartford;  and Reat is, for a while  —  as would be S.O.P. for a high seed in the first round  —  basically cleaning under his nails with this unseeded unknown Eric Clipperton.  At 1-4 in the second set, Clipperton sits down at the side-change and, instead of toweling off, reaches into his gear bag and extracts his classy little blond-wood case and gets out the Clock 17.  Fondles it.  Takes out the clip and hefts it and rams it home in its slot at the base of the grip with a chillingly solid-sounding click.  Caresses his left temple with the thing's blunt shiny barrel.  Everybody watching the match agrees it is one ugly and all-business-looking piece of personal-defense hardware.  Clipper-ton climbs up the rungs of the lifeguardish chair the umpire in his blue blazer (158) sits in and uses the umpire's mike to make public his intention of blowing his personal brains out all over the court with the hideous Clock, should he lose.  The small first-round gallery stiffens and inhales and doesn't exhale for a long time.  Reat audibly gulps.  Reat is tall, densely freckled, a good kid, one of Incandenza's fair-haired boys, not too bright, with the Satellite Tour so clearly in his future that at only fifteen he's already starting cholera shots and mastering Third World exchange rates.  And but for the remainder of the match (which lasts exactly eleven more games) Clipperton plays tennis with the Clock 17 held steadily to his left temple.  The gun makes tossing kind of a hassle, on Clipperton's serve, but Reat is letting the serves go by untouched anyway.  None of the E.T.A. staff has bothered to show up and coach Reat through what was supposed to be a standard first-round fingernail-cleaning, and so Reat is strategically and emotionally all alone out there, and he's opted for not even pretending to make an effort, given what the unseeded Clipperton seems willing to sacrifice for a win.  Ross Reat was the first and last junior player ever to shake Clipperton's free hand at the end of a match, and the moment's captured in a Hartford Cou-rant staff photo that some E.T.A. wiseacre'd later glued to the door of Struck's room with so much Elmer's all over the back that taking it off would gut the varnish, so the thing stays up for all in the hall to see, Reat here up at net on one knee, one arm over his eyes, the other hand extended upward to a Clipperton who'd simply obliterated him psychologically.  And Ross Reat was never quite exactly the same ever again after that, both Schtitt and de Lint have assured all \r\n future potentially mercy-minded E.T.A. males.\r\n And, the legend's story goes, Eric Clipperton never henceforth loses.  No one is willing to beat him and risk going through life with the sight of the Clock going off on his conscience.  Nobody ever knows where Clipperton comes from, to play.  Never seen at airports or Interstate exit ramps or ever even spotted carbloading at any Denny's between matches.  He just starts materializing, always alone, at increasingly highlevel junior tournaments, appears on draw-sheets with 'Ind.' by his name, plays competitive tennis with a Clock at his left temple;  (159) and his opponents, unwilling to sacrifice Clipperton's hostage (Clipperton même), barely even try, or else they go for impossible angles and spins, or else talk on mobile phones while they play or try to hit every ball between their legs or behind their backs;  and the matches' galleries tend to boo Clipperton just as much as they dare;  and Clipperton sits and hefts his 17-shot clip and takes the brass-jacketed 9-mm.  cartridges out sometimes and clicks a few together ruminatively in his hand in the sideline chair at all the odd-game breaks, and sometimes he tries little Western-gunslinger triggerguard-spins during the breaks;  but when play resumes Clipperton's deadly serious once more and has the Clock 17 at his temple, playing, and mows through the lackadaisical Clipperton Brigade round by round, and wins the whole tournament by what is essentially psychic default, and then right after collecting his trophy vanishes like the ground itself inhaled him.  His only even remote friend on the jr.  tour is eight-year-old Mario Incandenza, whom Clipperton meets because, even though Disney Leith and an early prorector named Cantrell are shepherding the male tournament contingent (including a solid but sort of plateau-stuck and no longer much improving seventeen-year-old Orin Incandenza) that summer, E.T.A. Headmaster Dr. J. O. Incandenza shows up at quite a few of the events on the domestic circuit, doing under ostensible U.S.T.A. auspices a two-part documentary on jr.  competitive tennis, stress, and light, and so Mario's tottering around with lens-cases and Tuffy tripods etc. at most of that late summer's meaningful events, and meets Clipperton, and finds Clipperton intriguing and in ways he can't be very articulate about hilarious, and is kind to him and seeks out his company, Clipperton's, or at any rate at least treats Clipperton like he exists, whereas by late July everybody else's attitude toward Clipperton resembled that kind of stiffly conspicuous nonrecognition that e.g.  accompanies farts at formal functions.\r\n One of Himself's short test-cartridges  —  shot to check out transverse aberration at various sun-angles, the case's little adhesive sticker says  —  contains the only available footage of the late Eric Clipperton (160)  —  from the preponderance of salt-tablet dispensers and littered Pledge husks and Dade County ambulances it was pretty likely shot at the hideous Sunkist Jr.  Inv.  cramp-fest in August in Miami  —  just a couple overexposed meters of Clipperton, head down and hunched on a low orange bleacher, bonyshouldered, in no shirt and untied Nikes, his Gothic-scripted case in his lap, his elbows on his knees and his hands spidered across both cheeks, staring down between his feet and trying not to smile as a withered-toddler-sized and forward-listing Mario stands beside him, supported by his portable police lock, holding a light-meter and something else too halated to make out on the tape, open very wide for a homodontic laugh at something funny Clipperton has apparently just let slip.\r\n Hal, having smoked cannabis on four separate occasions  —  twice w/ others  —  on this continental day of rest, plus still in a kind of guiltily sickening stomach-pit shock from the afternoon's Eschaton debacle and his failure to intervene or even get up out of his patio-chair, Hal has lost a bit of his grip and has just gotten on the outside of his fourth chocolate cannoli in half an hour, and is feeling the icy electric keening of some sort of incipient carie in the left-molar range, and also now as usual, after swinishness with sugar, finds himself sinking, emotionally, into a kind of distracted funk.  The puppet-film is reminiscent enough of the late Himself that just about the only more depressing thing to pay attention to or think about would be advertising and the repercussions of O.N.A.N.ite Reconfiguration for the U.S. advertising industry.  Mario's film executes some rather over-arty flash-cuts between the erections of Lucite fortifications and ATHSCME and E.W.D. displacement installations along the new U.S. border, on the one hand, and the shadowily implied Rodney-Tine-disastrous-love-interest element with the voluptuous puppet representing the infamous and enigmatic Québecois fatale known publicly only as 'Luria P————-\r\n ,' on the other.\r\n Tine's puppet's tiny brown felt hand is on Luria's voluptuously padded little Popsicle-stick knee in the famous Vienna, Virginia Szechuan steakhouse where, according to dark legend, Subsidized Time was conceived on the back of a chintzy Chinese-zodiac paper placemat, by R. Tine.  Hal happens to know the fall and rise of millennial U.S. advertising exceptionally well, because one of the only two academic things he's ever written about anything even remotely filmic (161) was a mammoth research paper on the tangled fates of broadcast television and the American ad industry.  This was the final and gradedetermining project in Mr. U. Ogilvie's year-long Intro to Entertainment Studies in May of Y.P.W.;  and Hal, a seventh-grader and only up to R in the Condensed O.E.D., wrote about TV-advertising's demise with a reverent tone that sounded like the events had taken place at the misty remove of glaciers and guys in pelts instead of just four years prior, more or less overlapping with the waxing of the Gentle Era and Experialist Reconfiguration Mario's puppet-show makes fun of.\r\n There's no question that the Network television industry  —  meaning, since PBS is a whole different kettle, the Big Three plus the fast-starting but low-endurance Fox  —  had already been in serious trouble.\r\n Between the exponential proliferation of cable channels, the rise of the total-viewer-control hand-held remotes known historically as zappers, and VCR-recording advances that used subtle volume- and hysterical-pitch-sensors to edit most commercials out of any program taped (here a rather chatty digression on legal battles between Networks and VCR-manufacturers over the Edit-function that Mr. O. drew a big red yawning skull next to, in the margin, out of impatience), the Networks were having problems drawing the kind of audiences they needed to justify the ad-rates their huge overhead's slavering maw demanded.  The Big Four's arch-foe was America's 100-plus regional and national cable networks, which, in the pre-millennial Limbaugh Era of extraordinarily generous Justice Dept.  interpretation of the Sherman statutes, had coalesced into a fractious but potent Trade Association under the stewardship of TCI's Malone, TBS's Turner, and a shadowy Albertan figure who owned the View-Out-the-Simulated- Window-of-Various-Lavish-Homes-in-Exotic-Locales Channel, the Yuletide-Fireplace Channel, CBCCable's Educational Programming Matrix, and four of Le Groupe Video-iron's five big Canadian Shop-at- Home networks.  Mounting an aggressive hearts-and-minds campaign that derided the 'passivity' of hundreds of millions of viewers forced to choose nightly between only four statistically pussified Network broadcasters, then extolled the 'empoweringly American choice' of 500-plus esoteric cable options, the American Council of Disseminators of Cable was attacking the Four right at the ideological root, the psychic matrix where viewers had been conditioned (conditioned, rather deliciously, by the Big Four Networks and their advertisers themselves, Hal notes) to associate the Freedom to Choose and the Right to Be Entertained with all that was U.S. and true.\r\n The A.C.D.C. campaign, brilliantly orchestrated by Boston MA's Viney and Veals Advertising, was pummelling the Big Four in the fiscal thorax with its ubiquitous anti-passivity slogan 'Don't Sit Still for Anything Less' when a wholly unintended coup de grace to Network viability was delivered in the form of an unrelated Viney and Veals side-venture.  V&V, like most U.S. ad agencies, greedily buttered its bread on every conceivable side when it could, and started taking advantage of the plummeting Big Four advertising rates to launch effective Network-ad campaigns for products and services that wouldn't previously have been able to afford national image-proliferation.  For the obscure local Nunhagen Aspirin Co. of Framingham MA, Viney and Veals got the Enfield-based National Cranio-Facial Pain Foundation to sponsor a huge touring exhibition of paintings by artists with crippling cranio-facial pain about crippling cranio-facial pain.  The resultant Network Nunhagen ads were simply silent 30-second shots of some of the exhibits, with NUNHAGEN ASPIRIN in soothing pale pastels at lower left.  The paintings themselves were excruciating, the more so because consumer HDTV had arrived, at least in the very upscale Incandenza home.  The ads with the more dental-pain-type paintings Hal doesn't even want to think back on, what with a fragment of cannoli wedged someplace upper-left he keeps looking around for Schacht to ask him to have an angle-mirrored look at.  One he can recall was of an ordinary middle-class American guy's regular face, but with a tornado coming out of the right eyesocket and a mouth at the vortex of that tornado, screaming.  And that was a mild one.  (162) The ads cost next to nothing to produce.\r\n Nunhagen Aspirin sales went nationally roofward even as ratings-figures for the Nunhagen ads themselves went from low to abysmal.  People found the paintings so excruciating that they were buying the product but recoiling from the ads.  Now you'd think this wouldn't matter so long as the product itself was selling so well, this fact that millions of national viewers were zapping or surfing to a different channel with their remotes the moment a silent painted twisted face with a hatchet in its forehead came on.\r\n But what made the Nunhagen ads sort of fatally powerful was that they also compromised the ratingsfigures for the ads that followed them and for the programs that enclosed the ads, and, worse, were disastrous because they were so violently unpleasing to look at that they awakened from their spectatorial slumbers literally millions of Network-devotees who'd hitherto been so numbed and pacified they usually hadn't bothered to expend the thumb-muscle-energy required to zap or surf away from anything on the screen, awakened legions of these suddenly violently repelled and disturbed viewers to the power and agency their thumbs actually afforded them.\r\n Viney and Veals's next broadcast cash-cow, a lurid series of spots for a national string of walk-in liposuction clinics, reinforced the VôíV trend of high product-sales but dreadful ad-ratings;  and here the Big Four were really put on the spot, because  —  even though the critics and P.T.A.s and eating-disorderoriented distaff PACs were denouncing the LipoVac spots' shots of rippling cellulite and explicit clips of procedures that resembled crosses between hyperbolic Hoover Upright demonstrations and filmed autopsies and cholesterol-conscious cooking shows that involved a great deal of chicken-fat drainage, and even though audiences' flights from the LipoVac spots themselves were absolutely gutting ratings for the other ads and the shows around them  —  Network execs' sweaty sleep infected with vivid REM-visions of flaccid atrophied thumbs coming twitchily to life over remote zap and surf controls  —  even though the spots were again fatally potent, the LipoVac string's revenues were so obscenely enhanced by the ads that LipoVac Unltd.  could soon afford to pay obscene sums for 30-second Network spots, truly obscene, sums the besieged Four now needed in the very worst way.  And so the LipoVac ads ran and ran, and much currency changed hands, and overall Network ratings began to slump as if punctured with something blunt.\r\n From a historical perspective it's easy to accuse the Network corporations of being greedy and shortsighted w/r/t explicit liposuction;  but Hal argued, with a compassion Mr. Ogilvie found surprising in a seventh-grader, that it's probably hard to be restrained and far-sighted when you're fighting against a malignant invasive V&V-backed cable kabal for your very fiscal life, day to day.\r\n In hindsight, though, the Big Four's spinal camel-straw had to have been V&V's trio of deep-focus b&w spots for a tiny Wisconsin cooperative firm that sold tongue-scrapers by pre-paid mail.  These ads just clearly crossed some kind of psychoaesthetic line, regardless of the fact that they single-handedly created a national tongue-scraper industry and put Fond du Lac's NoCoat Inc. on the Fortune 500.  (163) Stylistically reminiscent of those murderous mouthwash, deodorant, and dandruff-shampoo scenarios that had an antihero's chance encounter with a gorgeous desire-object ending in repulsion and shame because of an easily correctable hygiene deficiency, the NoCoat spots' chilling emotional force could be located in the exaggerated hideousness of the near-geologic layer of gray-white material coating the tongue of the otherwise handsome pedestrian who accepts a gorgeous meter maid's coquettish invitation to have a bit of a lick of the ice cream cone she's just bought from an avuncular sidewalk vendor.  The lingering close-up on an extended tongue that must be seen to be believed, coat-wise. "

        "text":"When the victim questions this, the scammer will try to guilt the victim, saying \"I guess you don't really want to meet\", \"I'm sorry you don't trust me\", and many other things to keep the victim on the hook.\r\n The scammer actually is employed directly or indirectly by a website, with a share of the victim's member or usage fees passed on to the scammer.\r\n Another variation is the scammer has a need to marry in order to inherit millions of dollars of gold left by a father, uncle, or grandfather.  The young woman will contact a victim and tell them of their plight of not being able to remove the gold from their country due to being unable to pay the duty or marriage taxes.  The woman will be unable to inherit the fortune until she gets married.  The marriage being a prequiste of the father, uncle or grandfather's will.  The scammer keeps the victim believing that they are sincere, until they are able to build up enough rapport to ask for thousands of dollars to help bring the gold into the victim's country.  The scammer will offer to fly to the victim's country to prove that they are a real person.  The victim will send money for the flight.  However when the victim goes to meet the scammer they never show up.  The victim contacts the scammer to ask what happened.  The scammer will provide an excuse such as not being able to get an exit visa, or illness of themselves or a family member.  Scammers are very adept at knowing how to \"play\" their victims - sending love poems, sex games in emails, building up a \"loving relationship\" with many promises of \"one day we will be married\".  Often photos of unknown African actresses will be used to lure the victim into believing they are talking to that person.  Victims may be invited to travel to the scammer's country;  in some cases the victims arrive with asked-for gift money for family members or bribes for corrupt officials, and then they are beaten and robbed or murdered.\r\n Also some romance scammer's will seek out a niche of various fetishes where they will find an obscure fetish and they will make the victim think that if they pay for the scammer's plane ticket that they will get to live out a sexual fantasy of theirs by having the scammer come to them to have sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n Cultural references\r\n\r\n The movie Raskenstam (1983) is based on a true story about a man who seduced over 100 women and convinced many to support his various projects financially.  He usually used newspaper contact ads, often with the headline \"Sun and spring\", which has become an idiomatic expression in Sweden.\r\n\r\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_scam"
