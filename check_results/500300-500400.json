        "text":" Since his first sight of tribesmen mutilating a body in the jungle, he had been afraid of what would happen to his own body when he died.  As if his body still would have some nerve responses, he had imagined with chilling repulsion what it would be like having the blood drained from his veins, embalming fluid pumped in, his central organs removed, his chest cavity treated with preservatives.  He had imagined what it would be like having the undertaker sew his lips together and his eye lids down and he had been sickened.  Death  —  strange that death should not bother him so much as what would happen to him after.  Well, they could not do all that to him if there was nothing of him to have it done to.  At least this way, doing it to himself, there was the chance of pleasure.\r\n\r\n He took the final stick of dynamite from his pocket, opened the softly-packed box of fuses and exploders, slipped one set of them into the stick, then arranged the stick between his pants and his stomach.  He hesitated to light the fuse.  This damn business about God, complicating things.  It was suicide he was about, and that could send him to hell forever.  If he believed.  But he did not, and he had lived with the idea of suicide for a long while, in the war carrying the poison capsule his commander had given him to prevent being captured, tortured.  Then when he had been captured, he had not had time to swallow it.  Now, though, he would light the fuse.\r\n\r\n But what if there was God?  Well, if God was, He could not fault him for being true to his disbelief.  One intense sensation yet reserved for him.  No pain.  Too instantaneous for pain.  Just one bright dissolving flash.  At least that would be something.  The numbness up to his groin now, he prepared to light the fuse.  Then, with one last bleary glance across the field to the playground, he saw in the firelight the double-focused image of a man in a Beret uniform stalking low and carefully through the cover of the swings and slides.  He carried a rifle.  Or a shotgun.  Rambo's eyes could no longer tell him which.  But he could make out it was a Beret uniform and he new that it was Trautman.  It could be no one else.  And behind Trautman, stumbling across the playground, clutching his stomach, came Teasle, it had to be him, lurching against a rectangular maze of climbing bars, and Rambo understood then there was a better way.\r\n\r\n 21\r\n\r\n Teasle clung to the bars, resting, then pushed himself away, staggering toward the fence.  He had been frantic that Trautman would get into the field before him, but now everything was going to be fine  —  Trautman was just a few steps ahead of him, crouched beside a bench, studying the thick brush of the field.  Just a few steps ahead of him.  He reached out and grabbed the bench to stop from falling, stood against it, breathing hoarsely.\r\n\r\n Without a glance away from the field, Trautman told him, 'Get down.  He'll see you for sure.'\r\n\r\n 'I would, but I'd never stand again.'\r\n\r\n 'So what would be the need?  You can't do any good the way you are.  Stay out of it.  You're killing yourself.'\r\n\r\n 'Lie down and let you finish it for me?  Screw.  I'm dying anyhow.'\r\n\r\n Trautman looked at him then.\r\n\r\n Kern was nearby, out of sight, yelling, 'Christ, get the hell down!  He has perfect cover and I'm not risking any men to go in!  I sent for gasoline!  He likes to play with fire, we'll burn him out!'\r\n\r\n Yes, that's your style, Kern, he thought.  He grabbed at the itch in his stomach, holding himself wetly in, and shuffled clumsily forward, propping himself against the fence.\r\n\r\n 'Get the hell down!'  Kern yelled again.\r\n\r\n Screw.  Burn him out, will you, Kern?  That's the kind of idea I expected from you, he thought.  And you can bet that before the fire gets to him, he'll come through here shooting to take a few of your men with him.  There's only one way to do this, and that's for somebody like me who doesn't have a hope anyhow to go in and take him.  You haven't lost enough men yet, or you'd know that.\r\n\r\n 'What the hell was that?'  Kern shouted, and Teasle realized that what he had been thinking he had said out loud.  That startled him, and he had to get over the fence while he still was able.  There was blood here on the fence.  The kid's.  Good.  He would be going over where the kid had.  His blood dripping on the kid's, he gathered himself and toppled over the fence.  He guessed that he struck the ground hard, but his brain did not register the impact.\r\n\r\n In a quick rush, Trautman came from the bench, vaulted the fence and landed in a neat crouch in a clump of brush beside him.\r\n\r\n 'Stay out of here,' Teasle told him.\r\n\r\n 'No, and if you don't shut up, he'll be onto everything we do.'\r\n\r\n 'He's not anywhere around to hear.  He's way over in the center of the field.  Look, you know he wants it to be me.  I have a right to be there at the end.  You know that.'\r\n\r\n 'Yes.'\r\n\r\n 'Then stay out of what doesn't concern you.'\r\n\r\n 'I started this long before you, and I'm going to help.\r\n\r\n There's no disgrace in taking help.  Now shut up, and let's go while you still can.'\r\n\r\n 'All right, you want to help?  Then help me stand.  I can't do it on my own.'\r\n\r\n 'You mean it?  What a mess this is going to be.'\r\n\r\n 'That's what Shingleton said.'\r\n\r\n 'What?'\r\n\r\n 'Nothing.'\r\n\r\n Trautman had him on his feet now, and then Trautman was crawling into the brush, disappearing, and Teasle stood, his head above the brush, surveying it, thinking.  Go.  Go on and crawl as fast as you can.  It won't make a difference what you do.  I'll get to him before.\r\n\r\n He coughed and spat something salty and shifted forward through the brush in a straight line toward the shed.  It was clear that the kid had gone this way, the branches broken down in a crude trail.  He kept his pace slow, not chancing the helplessness of a fall.  Even so, he was surprised at how soon he reached the shed.  But as he prepared to go inside, he realized instinctively that the kid was not in there.  He glanced around, and as if drawn toward a magnet, he shambled swaying down another broken path toward a large mound.  There.  The kid was there.  He knew it, could feel it.  There was no doubt.\r\n\r\n When he had been spread out on the sidewalk, someone had said he was delirious.  But that had been wrong.  He had not been delirious.  Not then.  Now.  Now he was delirious, and his body seemed to be melting from him, just his mind floating over the brush toward the mound, and the night was becoming glorious day, the orange reflection of the flames growing brighter, dancing wildly.  At the bottom of the mound he ceased floating and hovered transfixed, the splendorous sheen illuminating him.  It was coming.  He had no more time.  As if his will belonged to another, he saw his arm rise up before him, his pistol aiming toward the mound.\r\n\r\n 22\r\n\r\n The numbness was at Rambo's shoulders now, at his navel, and steadying the gun was like aiming with two stumps of wood.  He saw Teasle dispersing into triple focus down there, eyes bright, aiming, and he knew there should be no other way.  No passive lapse into nothing.  No lit fuse, self-disruption.  But this way, the only proper way, in the last of the fight, trying his best to kill Teasle.  Eyes and hands betraying him, he did not think he could hit Teasle.  But he had to try.  Then if he missed, Teasle would see the flash of his gun, and fire at it.  And at least then I'll have died trying, he thought.  He strove to squeeze his finger on the trigger, directing his aim at Teasle's center image.  The barrel was wobbling, and he would never hit him.  But he could not fake it.  He had to try as hard as he could.  He told his hand to squeeze on the trigger, but his hand would not work, and as he concentrated on it, clenching, the gun went off unintended.  So careless and sloppy.  He cursed himself.  Not the real fight he had hoped for, and now Teasle's bullet would come when he did not deserve it.  He waited.  It should have come already.  He squinted to clear his vision, looking down the mound where Teasle lay flat in the brush.  Christ, he had hit him.  God, he had not wanted that, and the numbness was so overwhelming by now that he could never light the fuse before it nulled him.  So poor.  So ugly and poor.  Then death took him over, but it was not at all the stupefying sleep, bottomless and murky, that he had expected.  It was more like what he had expected from the dynamite, but coming from his head instead of his stomach, and he could not understand why it should be like that, and it frightened him.  Then since it was the total of what remained, he let it happen, went with it, erupted free through the back of his head and his skull, catapulted through the sky, through myriad spectra, onward outward, forever dazzling, brilliant, and he thought if he kept on like this for long enough he might be wrong and see God after all.\r\n\r\n 23\r\n\r\n Well, Teasle thought.  Well.  He lay back on the brush, marvelling at the stars, repeating to himself that he did not know what had hit him.  He really did not.  He had seen the flash of the gun and he had fallen, but he had been slow and gentle to fall, and he really did not know what had hit him, did not sense it, respond to it.  He thought about Anna and then stopped that, not because the memory was painful, but because after everything she just didn't seem important anymore.\r\n\r\n He heard someone stepping, cracking, through the brush.  The kid coming, he thought.  But slow, very slow to come.  Well sure, he's hurt bad.\r\n\r\n But then it was only Trautman standing there, head outlined against the sky, face and uniform lustrous from the flames, but eyes dull.  'What's it like?'  Trautman said.  'Is it bad?'\r\n\r\n 'No,' he said.  'Actually it's kind of pleasant.  If I don't think about what it's bringing.  What was that explosion I heard?  It sounded like another gas station.'\r\n\r\n 'Me.  I guess it was me.  I took the top of his head off with this shotgun.'\r\n\r\n 'What's it like for you?'\r\n\r\n 'Better than when I knew he was in pain.'\r\n\r\n 'Yes.'\r\n\r\n Trautman pumped the empty shell from the shotgun, and Teasle watched its wide arc glistening through the air.  He thought about Anna again, and she still did not interest him.  He thought about his house he had fixed up in the hills, the cats there, and none of that interested him either.  He thought about the kid, and flooded with love for him, and just a second before the empty shell would have completed its arc to the ground, he relaxed, accepted peacefully.  And was dead.\r\n\r\n The End"

And I think, long-term buy ability is one of those things that we looked at.  So for everybody who’s gotten money for their program is still in business and it’s a locative program, it’s a major investment.  Fifty per cent of the construction cost, especially in Red Hook, where buildings have been vacant for a very long time, is still sixty thousand dollars.  That’s a lot of money.  And with the CBC long program they have to pay that money back.  Most people are able to get money from other ways, they find private investments.  We also find that by having the tenant renovate the space, not the landlord, the quality of renovation is much greater, because the landlord sometimes just makes it a blank space, uses low-cost construction materials, where the new tenant will really put their money into the space and make it something really nice.\r\n\r\n You already see that happening, it happen in ____________.  People from _________ move to ____________, then people move to Red Hook.  It’s funny, another neighborhood that we work with businesses in, Sunset Park, has started to see a lot of artists that had been moving at Sunset Park.  So there is a natural progression.  Neighborhood do change, but if they change slowly, it allows people that were their before to become part of the new Red Hook and you do have local artists, that have __________ port buildings there and that are still part of the fabric of the life.  Most of the people that were there before own property there.  That is not as big of a problem.  The people in public housing, those who rent the subsidized areas, so that’s kind of a constant, they rent them from the city and that’s not something that is probably very good to change.  So that’s part of the neighborhood low estate as is."

        "text":"gradually have been established, with a disappointment felt whenever\r\n the results frustrated expectation.  Here is a perfectly plausible germ\r\n for all our higher consistencies.  Nowadays, if an object claims from us\r\n a reaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class of\r\n objects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly.  The situation is\r\n intellectually unsatisfactory.  To gain relief we seek either to preserve\r\n the reaction by re-interpreting the object, or, leaving the object as it\r\n is, we react in a way contrary to the way claimed of us.  Neither\r\n solution is easy.  Such a situation might be that of Mr. Joseph, with me\r\n claiming assent to humanism from him.  He can not apperceive it so as to\r\n permit him to gratify my claim;  but there is enough appeal in the claim\r\n to induce him to write a whole article in justification of his refusal.\r\n If he should assent to humanism, on the other hand, that would drag\r\n after it an unwelcome, yea incredible, alteration of his previous mental\r\n beliefs.  Whichever alternative he might adopt, however, a new\r\n equilibrium of intellectual consistency would in the end be reached.  He\r\n would feel, whichever way he decided, that he was now thinking truly.\r\n But if, with his old habits unaltered, he should simply add to them the\r\n new one of advocating humanism quietly or noisily, his mind would be\r\n rent into two systems, each of which would accuse the other of\r\n falsehood.  The resultant situation, being profoundly unsatisfactory,\r\nwould also be instable.\r\n\r\n Theoretic truth is thus no relation between our mind and archetypal\r\n reality.  It falls _within_ the mind, being the accord of some of its\r\n processes and objects with other processes and objects—'accord'\r\n consisting here in well-definable relations.  So long as the satisfaction\r\n of feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever collateral profits may\r\n seem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the\r\n balance—provided always that we are highly organized intellectually,\r\nwhich the majority of us are not.  The amount of accord which satisfies\r\n most men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their\r\n usual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of\r\n sense-perceptions in which their lives are cast.  The theoretic truth\r\n that most of us think we 'ought' to attain to is thus the possession of\r\n a set of predicates that do not contradict their subjects.  We preserve\r\n it as often as not by leaving other predicates and subjects out.\r\n\r\n In some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others.  The form of\r\n inner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at which collateral\r\n profits stop.  Such men systematize and classify and schematize and make\r\n synoptical tables and invent ideal objects for the pure love of\r\n unifying.  Too often the results, glowing with 'truth' for the inventors,\r\nseem pathetically personal and artificial to bystanders.  Which is as\r\n much as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truth can leave us\r\n in the lurch as easily as any other criterion.\r\n\r\n I think that if Mr. Joseph will but consider all these things a little\r\n more concretely, he may find that the humanistic scheme and the notion\r\n of theoretic truth fall into line consistently enough to yield him also\r\n intellectual satisfaction.\r\n\r\n FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[129] [Reprinted without change from _Mind_, N.

Y.,\r\nNovember 4, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n XII\r\n\r\n ABSOLUTISM AND EMPIRICISM[140]\r\n\r\n\r\n No seeker of truth can fail to rejoice at the terre-à-terre sort of\r\n discussion of the issues between Empiricism and Transcendentalism (or,\r\nas the champions of the latter would probably prefer to say, between\r\n Irrationalism and Rationalism) that seems to have begun in _Mind_. [141]\r\n It would seem as if, over concrete examples like Mr. J. S. Haldane's,\r\nboth parties ought inevitably to come to a better understanding.  As a\r\n reader with a strong bias towards Irrationalism, I have studied his\r\n article[142] with the liveliest admiration of its temper and its\r\n painstaking effort to be clear.  But the cases discussed failed to\r\n satisfy me, and I was at first tempted to write a Note animadverting\r\n upon them in detail.  The growth of the limb, the sea's contour, the\r\n vicarious functioning of the nerve-centre, the digitalis curing the\r\n heart, are unfortunately _not_ cases where we can _see_ any\r\n _through-and-through_ conditioning of the parts by the whole.  They are\r\n all cases of reciprocity where subjects, supposed independently to\r\n exist, acquire certain attributes through their relations to other\r\n subjects.  That they also _exist_ through similar relations is only an\r\n ideal supposition, not verified to our understanding in these or any\r\n other concrete cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\n If, however, one were to urge this solemnly, Mr. Haldane's friends could\r\n easily reply that he only gave us such examples on account of the\r\n hardness of our hearts.  He knew full well their imperfection, but he\r\n hoped that to those who would not spontaneously ascend to the Notion of\r\n the Totality, these cases might prove a spur and suggest and symbolize\r\n something better than themselves.  No particular case that can be brought\r\n forward is a real concrete.  They are all abstractions from the Whole,\r\nand of course the \"through-and-through\" character can not be found in\r\n them.  Each of them still contains among its elements what we call\r\n _things_, grammatical subjects, forming a sort of residual _caput\r\n mortuum_ of Existence after all the relations that figure in the\r\n examples have been told off.  On this \"existence,\" thinks popular\r\n philosophy, things may live on, like the winter bears on their own fat,\r\nnever entering relations at all, or, if entering them, entering an\r\n entirely different set of them from those treated of in Mr. Haldane's\r\n examples.  Thus _if_ the digitalis were to weaken instead of\r\n strengthening the heart, and to produce death (as sometimes happens), it\r\n would determine itself, through determining the organism, to the\r\n function of \"kill\" instead of that of \"cure.\"  The function and relation\r\n seem adventitious, depending on what kind of a heart the digitalis gets\r\n hold of, the digitalis and the heart being facts external and, so to\r\n speak, accidental to each other.  But this popular view, Mr. Haldane's\r\n friends will continue, is an illusion.  What seems to us the \"existence\"\r\n of digitalis and heart outside of the relations of killing or curing, is\r\n but a function in a wider system of relations, of which, _pro hac vice_,\r\nwe take no account.  The larger system determines the _existence_ just\r\n as absolutely as the system \"kill,\" or the system \"cure,\" determined the\r\n _function_ of the digitalis.  Ascend to the absolute system, instead of\r\n biding with these relative and partial ones, and you shall see that the\r\n law of through-and-throughness must and does obtain.\r\n\r\n Of course, this argument is entirely reasonable, and debars us\r\n completely from chopping logic about the concrete examples Mr. Haldane\r\n has chosen.  It is not his fault if his categories are so fine an\r\n instrument that nothing but the sum total of things can be taken to show\r\n us the manner of their use.  It is simply our misfortune that he has not\r\n the sum total of things to show it by.  Let us fall back from all\r\n concrete attempts and see what we can do with his notion of\r\n through-and-throughness, avowedly taken _in abstracto_.  In abstract\r\n systems the \"through-and-through\" Ideal is realized on every hand.  In\r\n any system, as such, the members are only _members_ in the system.\r\n Abolish the system and you abolish its members, for you have conceived\r\n them through no other property than the abstract one of membership.\r\n Neither rightness nor leftness, except through bi-laterality.  Neither\r\n mortgager nor mortgagee, except through mortgage.  The logic of these\r\n cases is this:—_If_ A, then B;  but _if_ B, then A: wherefore _if_\r\n either, Both;  and if not Both, Nothing.\r\n\r\n It costs nothing, not even a mental effort, to admit that the absolute\r\n totality of things _may_ be organized exactly after the pattern of one\r\n of these \"through-and-through\" abstractions.  In fact, it is the\r\n pleasantest and freest of mental movements.  Husband makes, and is made\r\n by, wife, through marriage;  one makes other, by being itself other;\r\n everything self-created through its opposite—you go round like a\r\n squirrel in a cage.  But if you stop and reflect upon what you are about,\r\nyou lay bare the exact point at issue between common sense and the\r\n \"through-and-through\" school.\r\n\r\n What, in fact, is the logic of these abstract systems?  It is, as we said\r\n above: If any Member, then the Whole System;  if not the Whole System,\r\nthen Nothing.  But how can Logic possibly do anything more with these\r\n two hypotheses than combine them into the single disjunctive\r\n proposition—\"Either this Whole System, just as it stands, or Nothing at\r\n all.\"  Is not that disjunction the ultimate word of Logic in the matter,\r\nand can any disjunction, as such, resolve _itself_?  It may be that Mr.\r\n Haldane sees how one horn, the concept of the Whole System, carries real\r\n existence with it.  But if he has been as unsuccessful as I in\r\n assimilating the Hegelian re-editings of the Anselmian proof,[143] he\r\n will have to say that though Logic may determine _what_ the system must\r\n be, _if_ it is, something else than Logic must tell us _that_ it is.  Mr.\r\n Haldane in this case would probably consciously, or unconsciously, make\r\n an appeal to Fact: the disjunction _is_ decided, since nobody can\r\n dispute that now, as a matter of fact, _something_, and not nothing,\r\n_is_.  We must _therefore_, he would probably say, go on to admit the\r\n Whole System in the desiderated sense.  Is not then the validity of the\r\n Anselmian proof the nucleus of the whole question between Logic and\r\n Fact?  Ought not the efforts of Mr. Haldane and his friends to be\r\n principally devoted to its elucidation?  Is it not the real door of\r\n separation between Empiricism and Rationalism?  And if the Rationalists\r\n leave that door for a moment off its hinges, can any power keep that\r\n abstract, opaque, unmediated, external, irrational, and irresponsible\r\n monster, known to the vulgar as bare Fact, from getting in and\r\n contaminating the whole sanctuary with his presence?  Can anything\r\n prevent Faust from changing \"Am Anfang war das Wort\" into \"Am Anfang war\r\n die That?\"\r\n\r\n Nothing in earth or heaven.  Only the Anselmian proof can keep Fact out\r\n of philosophy.  The question, \"Shall Fact be recognized as an ultimate\r\n principle?\"  is the whole issue between the Rationalists and the\r\n Empiricism of vulgar thought.\r\n\r\n Of course, if so recognized, Fact sets a limit to the\r\n \"through-and-through\" character of the world's rationality.  That\r\n rationality might then mediate between all the members of our\r\n conception of the world, but not between the conception itself and\r\n reality.  Reality would have to be given, not by Reason, but by Fact.\r\n Fact holds out blankly, brutally and blindly, against that universal\r\n deliquescence of everything into logical relations which the Absolutist\r\n Logic demands, and it is the only thing that does hold out.  Hence the\r\n ire of the Absolutist Logic—hence its non-recognition, its 'cutting' of\r\n Fact.\r\n\r\n The reasons it gives for the 'cutting' are that Fact is speechless, a\r\n mere word for the negation of thought, a vacuous unknowability, a\r\n dog-in-the-manger, in truth, which having no rights of its own, can find\r\n nothing else to do than to keep its betters out of theirs.\r\n\r\n There are two points involved here: first the claim that certain things\r\n have rights that are absolute, ubiquitous and all pervasive, and in\r\n regard to which nothing else can possibly exist in its _own_ right;  and\r\n second that anything that denies _this_ assertion is _pure_ negativity\r\n with no positive context whatsoever.\r\n\r\n Take the latter point first.  Is it true that what is negative in one way\r\n is thereby convicted of incapacity to be positive in any other way?  The\r\n word \"Fact\" is like the word \"Accident,\" like the word \"Absolute\"\r\n itself.  They all have their negative connotation.  In truth, their whole\r\n connotation is negative and relative.  All it says is that, whatever the\r\n thing may be that is denoted by the words, _other_ things do not control\r\n it.  Where fact, where accident is, they must be silent, it alone can\r\n speak.  But that does not prevent its speaking as loudly as you please,\r\nin its own tongue.  It may have an inward life, self-transparent and\r\n active in the maximum degree.  An indeterminate future volition on my\r\n part, for example, would be a strict accident as far as my present self\r\n is concerned.  But that could not prevent it, _in the moment in which it\r\n occurred_, from being possibly the most intensely living and luminous\r\n experience I ever had.  Its quality of being a brute fact _ab extra_ says\r\n nothing whatever as to its inwardness.  It simply says to _outsiders_:\r\n'Hands off!'\r\n\r\n And this brings us back to the first point of the Absolutist indictment\r\n of Fact.  Is that point really anything more than a fantastic dislike to\r\n letting _anything_ say 'Hands off'?  What else explains the contempt the\r\n Absolutist authors exhibit for a freedom defined simply on its\r\n \"negative\" side, as freedom \"from,\" etc.?  What else prompts them to\r\n deride such freedom?  But, dislike for dislike, who shall decide?  Why is\r\n not their dislike at having me \"from\" them, entirely on a par with mine\r\n at having them \"through\" me?\r\n\r\n I know very well that in talking of dislikes to those who never mention\r\n them, I am doing a very coarse thing, and making a sort of intellectual\r\n Orson of myself.  But, for the life of me, I can not help it, because I\r\n feel sure that likes and dislikes _must_ be among the ultimate factors\r\n of their philosophy as well as of mine.  Would they but admit it!  How\r\n sweetly we then could hold converse together!  There is something finite\r\n about us both, as we now stand.  We do not know the Absolute Whole _yet_.\r\n _Part_ of it is still negative to us.  Among the _whats_ of it still\r\n stalks a mob of opaque _thats_, without which we cannot think.  But just\r\n as I admit that this is all possibly provisional, that even the\r\n Anselmian proof may come out all right, and creation _may_ be a rational\r\n system through-and-through, why might they not also admit that it may\r\n all be otherwise, and that the shadow, the opacity, the negativity, the\r\n \"from\"-ness, the plurality that is ultimate, _may_ never be wholly\r\n driven from the scene.  We should both then be avowedly making\r\n hypotheses, playing with Ideals.  Ah!  Why is the notion of hypothesis so\r\n abhorrent to the Hegelian mind?\r\n\r\n And once down on our common level of hypothesis, we might then admit\r\n scepticism, since the Whole is not yet revealed, to be the soundest\r\n _logical_ position.  But since we are in the main not sceptics, we might\r\n go on and frankly confess to each other the motives for our several\r\n faiths.  I frankly confess mine—I can not but think that at bottom they\r\n are of an æsthetic and not of a logical sort.  The \"through-and-through\"\r\n universe seems to suffocate me with its infallible impeccable\r\n all-pervasiveness.  Its necessity, with no possibilities;  its relations,\r\nwith no subjects, make me feel as if I had entered into a contract with\r\n no reserved rights, or rather as if I had to live in a large seaside\r\n boarding-house with no private bed-room in which I might take refuge\r\n from the society of the place.  I am distinctly aware, moreover, that the\r\n old quarrel of sinner and pharisee has something to do with the matter.\r\n Certainly, to my personal knowledge, all Hegelians are not prigs, but I\r\n somehow feel as if all prigs ought to end, if developed, by becoming\r\n Hegelians.  There is a story of two clergymen asked by mistake to conduct\r\n the same funeral.  One came first and had got no farther than \"I am the\r\n Resurrection and the Life,\" when the other entered.  \" _I_ am the\r\n Resurrection and the Life,\" cried the latter.  The \"through-and-through\"\r\n philosophy, as it actually exists, reminds many of us of that clergyman.\r\n It seems too buttoned-up and white-chokered and clean-shaven a thing to\r\n"

For six weeks, Joe will take his first extended vacation in 10 years from touring after successfully concluding the debut of his All Acoustic Summer 2012 Tour. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In the last 365 days, Bonamassa has toured both with his rock supergroup, BLACK COUNTRY COMMUNION (BCC);  and his solo band reaching over 25 different countries, over 34 different States in the US and reached three different continents with his sold-out live shows. \r\n\r\n On the recording side, Joe released the seconnd studio CD with BCC and also a live DVD/CD with the band.  His new studio album, Driving Towards The Daylight, broke all of Joe’s previous chart positions and records and his live DVD from the world famous Beacon in NYC pushed the limits with his amazing special guests.  Most recently, Joe just finished his debut all acoustic show where he recorded it for a DVD release at the world renowned Vienna Opera House this past month. \r\n\r\n Regarding his non-stop work schedule, Bonamassa said, “It’s been an amazing past 12 months and I have accomplished so much and worked with some of the most talented people in the music industry - for which I feel very fortunate.  This is my lifelong dream to be able to play guitar to a live audience and make music for a living.  As I begin my vacation for the next six weeks I am more inspired than ever, and I look forward to getting a short rest so I can get right back to what I love doing: Performing for my fans.” \r\n\r\n He continued, “In the meantime, I am excited to be home and hangout with my friends.  But as you may know it is never easy for me to do nothing at all and I am already planning to fill my time with some session work with a few musician buddies of mine too.  I am most excited about starting the Solo tour again in September where I will visit two different continents (Asia and Australia), and six different countries in two weeks – including my first ever visit to Thailand, The Philippines, and Hawaii.  I am looking forward to what I know will be a crazy touring schedule but getting out there and performing for my fans makes everything worthwhile!”"

        "text":"NC: Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.  You know, it's often funny to see movie studios try to rip off popular box office hits to try to make a quick buck.  Take for example the year that gave us Home Alone and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Both of these films were gigantic blockbusters as well as family friendly.  So Touchstone Studios got an idea.  \"Duh, what if we took these two films that had nothing in common, put 'em together, and create our own worthless piece of crap!\"  You'd come up with 3 Ninjas.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): A shameful attempt to cash in on other people's creative abilities.  This film was so blatant at what it was ripping off.  Obviously they were taking the martial arts from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and the house traps that were taken directly from Home Alone.\r\n\r\n NC: Now I know what you're thinking.  I'm not giving studio moguls enough credit.  I mean, NOBODY could be so financially desperate or creatively shallow to attempt such an act.  I mean, are they really so stupid enough to combine movies like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Home Alone?\r\n\r\n NC: They are when they friggin' advertise it like that!  Take a look!\r\n\r\n NC: \"Crosses Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Home Alone.\"  Abandon all originality, ye who enter here.\r\n\r\n NC: Now with that said, I'm sure a lot of you are thinking \"How bad a film crossover between Home Alone and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles possibly be?\"  Pretty bad.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): The film's about three boys who study ninjitsu with their Grampa Morrey.  It's KIND of odd, considering he's Japanese and not one of these other characters looks Asian.  So over the summer, he teaches them how to use nunchucks, swords, Siamese stars, and a bunch of other weapons that parents would have a heart attack if they saw their kids using.  The boys' names are as follows.  Michael, the chubby kid, Jeffrey, the forgettable middle kid, and Samuel, the \"oh my god I swear that's a miniature version of Jaime Lee Curtis kid.\"\r\n\r\n Jeffrey: That's cool.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): It's interesting how chubby Grampa is, considering he's supposed to be a ninja master.  Except of course when he's doing flips and kicks, then he MIRACULOUSLY loses 20 pounds all of a sudden.  I wonder why that is?\r\n\r\n Samuel: Grampa!  How'd you do that?\r\n\r\n Grampa: Next time, try attacking in a nonsmoking section!\r\n The kids laugh\r\n\r\n NC: Hahahaha.  Grampa obviously hasn't taught them good humor yet.\r\n\r\n Dad: That's very funny.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): At the end of the summer, Grampa decides to give them all ninja names.\r\n\r\n Grampa: (to Samuel) You shall be known as Rocky, (to Jeffrey) you shall be known as Colt.  Little one...since your energy begins and ends with your tummy, you shall be known as Tum Tum!\r\n\r\n NC: Hahahahahaha!  Grampa likes to make fun of other people's short comings!\r\n\r\n Samuel: Grampa is kind of a goofball in a way, but when it comes to martial arts and stuff, he's pretty cool.\r\n\r\n NC: Yes, the line between goofball and senile insanity is often a thin one.\r\n\r\n Grampa: Don't be overconfident!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Now the kids' father is an FBI agent who's after the sinister crime boss Snyder, who apparently deals in trading killer weapons designed by Nerf.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): He also doesn't believe in buying bodyguards with those useless weapons and silly guns, nope, Snyder's diabolical gang is made up of 100% ninjas.  In the black suits and everything.\r\n\r\n NC: Well, I have no idea how this is gonna connect to the story with the three boys, but let's just wait and see.  The father always comes close to catching Snyder, but always manages to just miss him.\r\n\r\n Snyder: Wish I could stay and chat, but I've gotta fly!\r\n\r\n NC: You like that?  You like the way the copter came up after I said the word fly?  I trained him to do that you know.  Cost me like thousands of dollars, but the reaction on your face?  Totally worth it.\r\n\r\n Jeffrey: You're a geek.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Then Snyder actually drops by Grampa's house and asks him to train his evil henchmen because apparently they have some history together.  But because this movie is afraid to have any semblance of plot, he sends his men to attack Grampa and the three boys.  Here, the boys figure out ANOTHER ancient secret of martial arts: apparently, all ninjas are made out of cartoon sound effects.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): You know, as a side note I should point out that the philosphy of a ninja is to blend into your environment.  NOT STICK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB!  You're only supposed to wear those in the dark you morons!\r\n\r\n Stoner killer: SHUT UP!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So the boys actually do live a semi-normal life, or as close as possible considering the circumstances.  They go to school, they have...odd looking girlfriends...and they even have bullies they have to put up with, or the closes thing this movie considers to be bullies.\r\n\r\n Fat bully: Yeah little horsey, how about some hay?\r\n\r\n NC: Seriously, how come movie bullies are always so lame?  I mean look at these guys, they look like a mix between Fat Albert and the Little Rascals.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): In yet another pointless scene, the boys challenge the bullies to a basketball game in order to win back the bike of one of their girlfriends.\r\n\r\n Samuel: How many points to a game?\r\n\r\n Fat Bully: 10, duh.\r\n\r\n Samuel: Fine.  We'll spot you nine, you take first out.\r\n\r\n Bullies: Cake.\r\n\r\n NC: ...did they just say \"cake?\"\r\n\r\n Bullies: Cake.\r\n\r\n NC: ...did I just jump a dimension or something, I mean when did \"cake\" become a form of popular slang?  Good God, it's like the writers just didn't care anymore so they started tossing out random words, trying to form a sentence.  \"Cake?!\"  That's like in the middle of a sentence me just shouting out \"Stuffed cabbages.\"  Why?  I don't know, because it makes about as much sense as \"cake!\"\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So obviously the boys beat the bullies and get the girlfriend's bike back.  I wouldn't mind this scene so much if it wasn't for this one certain part.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Okay, so he obviously steps on something here, but they never address what it is.  What the hell did he step on?\r\n\r\n NC: Was he just gliding on his ninja awesomeness?  I mean it makes no sense!\r\n\r\n Jeffrey: Whatever.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So alright, we see where the Ninja Turtles references come from, but what about the Home Alone stuff?  Well Snyder decides he wants to kidnap the three boys and hold them ransom so he can keep their father off his case.  So he hires three surfer criminals to abduct the kids and bring them to his lair.\r\n\r\n Jeffrey: The good news is, the delivery guys just created* the babysitter with the pizza.  The bad news is, they're carrying guns.\r\n\r\n (*I listened over and over, I can't understand what the kid is saying there;  \"created\" is the only word that fits, despite it making absolutely no sense)\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): At first the kids wanna do the smart thing and notify the authorities.\r\n\r\n Samuel: We'll call the police.\r\n\r\n Jeffrey: Hold it!  If we can take these three robbers ourselves...\r\n\r\n Samuel: Then maybe dad will see that our ninja training's worth it!\r\n\r\n NC: ...summer training, or probable death.  (pretends to weigh options) I guess I'd go with summer training too.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So oddly enough instead of using their ninja skills, they devise diabolical traps to snatch the burglars with.  I love how even though they were notified of the burglars' presence just a few moments ago, that they somehow put together a plan that actually has phases.\r\n\r\n Samuel: Prepare for Phase 1.  Okay, Phase 2.\r\n\r\n NC: Okay, you were in there for like 2 minutes, how can you come up with a plan that has phases to it?\r\n\r\n Stoner killer: That's a very good question my friend.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Look at this, one of them actually does the Home Alone face here.  I mean that's how much this movie doesn't give a crap.\r\n\r\n Samuel: This.  Really.  Sucks!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): I mean half of these traps don't even make sense.  How are you supposed to slip on jelly beans for crying out loud, wouldn't you just squash them?  And for that matter, how come everyone carries a gun but never uses them?  Does this movie exist in ANY REALM OF REALITY?\r\n\r\n Stoner killer: Dude, sensitive.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Meanwhile, Snyder's ninjas show up and kidnap the kids properly.  After learning about the kids abduction, their parents realize there's only one logical solution: a short, balding Asian who's studied more Japanese buffets than he has Japanese martial arts.\r\n\r\n Michael: Oh that's reassuring!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So rather than send in a S.W.A.T. Team of qualified professionals, it's Grampa Morrey who's gonna perform the rescue!  Yeah I know, just go with it.  The kids are being held on a cargo ship crawling with second-rate pajama wearing ninjas.  They make up an idea to get out of their cell by tricking the guard into thinking the telephone is for him.\r\n\r\n Phone operator: This is a phone check, is that you Frank?\r\n\r\n NC: WHY IS THE TELEPHONE OPERATOR WEARING A NINJA SUIT?  I mean what is the point?!  Is the telephone operator a martial artist?  If so, why isn't he out there fighting with the rest of the ninjas?  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF HIRING A MARTIAL ARTIST TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE?  IT MAKES NO SENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n Mom: Stop it!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So as you probably imagine, an entire boatload of ninjas can't seem to beat three little children in bad 80s clothes.  Why is it ninjas always scream before they attack someone?  Doesn't that kind of alert them that you're there?\r\n\r\n NC: Whoa, who's this guy?  Kinda looks like an Asian Joker or something.\r\n\r\n NC: Holy shit, this guy's psychotic!  What's he gonna do?\r\n\r\n NC: ...well thank you movie.  Thank you for ruining the only possibly cool character in this entire film.  You've dashed my hopes yet again.\r\n\r\n Stoner killer: My apologies my good man.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): After fighting like a zillion ninjas and an oversized bodyguard, Grampa shows up to take on the evil Snyder in a one-on-one battle.\r\n\r\n NC: And this is the portion I like to call \"Spot the real Grampa!\"\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): Let's see here, stuntman, stuntman, stuntman, GRAMPA!  Stuntman, stuntman, stuntman, GRAMPA!  After awhile, Grampa starts to tire and eventually starts to get his ass kicked.  But just when it looks like he's down for the count, Grampa still has one ace up his sleeve.\r\n Grampa jams jelly beans into Snyder's mouth\r\n\r\n NC: (gasp) JELLY BEANS!  MY ONE WEAKNESS!\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): So Grampa defeats Snyder, the FBI shows up, the kids are reunited with their parents and they all life happily ever after.  Whoop-de-friggin' do.\r\n\r\n NC (voiceover): But wait, that name seems kinda familiar.\r\n\r\n NC: Jon Turtle-tawb, Turtle-tib, whatever.  How come I know that name?\r\n\r\n NC: Holy shit, this guy's actually done a lot of movies!  Including Phenomenon, While You Were Sleeping, Cool Runnings, and even recent blockbusters like the National Treasure movies.  So...how the hell did he get stuck doing this piece of shit?  I mean, what exactly does this all mean?  It means get out of crap as fast as you can.  The other members of this movie didn't take that advice, and where did they go?  3 Ninjas part 2, 3 and 4.  One of them with international sensation Hulk Hogan.  So always remember kids, quit while you're...in the position of quitting.  Like I should've quit watching this movie an hour and a half ago.  It's stupid, uninventive, and reminds me of just why two film franchises don't make a right.  Besides, it's obvious what the Ninja Turtles/Home Alone crossover should've been: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Beat Up McCauley Culkin.  Now THAT would've been a Christmas movie.  I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to."

This is true.”\r\n “They say if you know the Lethani, you cannot lose a fight.”\r\n Another nod.\r\n I shook my head, knowing I wasn’t getting my point across.  “They say the Lethani is a secret power.  Adem keep their words inside.”  I made a gesture as if gathering things close to my body and hoarding them.  “Then those words are like wood in a fire.  This word fire makes the Adem very strong.  Very fast.  Skin like iron.  This is why you can fight many men and win.”\r\n Tempi looked at me intently.  He made a gesture I didn’t recognize.  “That is mad talking,” he said at last.  “Is that the correct word?  Mad?”  He stuck out his tongue and rolled his eyes, wiggling his fingers at the side of his head.\r\n I couldn’t help but laugh nervously at the display.  “Yes.  Mad is the word.  Also crazy.”\r\n “Then what you have said is mad talking and also crazy.”\r\n “But what I saw today,” I said.  “Your nose did not break when struck with a man’s head.  That is no natural thing.”\r\n Tempi shook his head as he climbed to his feet.  “Come.  Stand.”\r\n I stood, and Tempi stepped close to me.  “Striking with the head is clever.  It is quick.  Can startle if opponent is not ready.  But I am not not ready.”\r\n He stepped closer still, until we were almost touching chests.  “You are the loud man,” he said.  “Your head is hard.  My nose is soft.”  He reached out and took hold of my head with both his hands.  “You want this.”  He brought my head down, slowly, until my forehead pressed his nose.\r\n Tempi let go of my head.  “Striking with the head is quick.  For me, little time.  Can I move?”  He moved my head down as he pulled away, and this time my forehead came into contact with his mouth instead, as if he were giving me a kiss.  “This is not good.  The mouth is soft.”\r\n He tipped my head back again.  “If I am very fast . .  .”  He took a full step back and brought my head down farther, until my forehead touched his chest.  He let me go and I stood back up.  “This is still not good.  My chest is not soft.  But this man has a head harder than many.”  His eyes twinkled a little, and I chuckled, realizing he had made a joke.\r\n “So.”  Tempi said, stepping back to where we were before.  “What can Tempi do?”  He motioned.  “Strike with the head.  Slow.  I show.”\r\n Vaguely nervous, I brought my head down slowly, as if trying to break his nose.\r\n Matching my slow speed, Tempi leaned forward and tucked his chin a bit.  It wasn’t much of a change, but this time as I brought my head down, my nose met the top of his head.\r\n Tempi stepped back.  “See?  Cleverness.  Not mad-thinking word fire.”\r\n “It was very fast,” I said, feeling slightly embarrassed.  “I could not see.”\r\n “Yes.  Fighting is fast.  Train to be fast.

They fear that those who depend on them for support - their dependents - will not have enough income to cover funeral, housing and living expenses. \r\n If you have these concerns, you may have considered buying life insurance - which guarantees that certain people of your choice (your beneficiaries) will receive money if you die. \r\n Many people do not spend enough time learning about life insurance, because thinking and talking about death makes them uncomfortable.  They may rely solely on one agent's suggestions.  Uninformed insurance buyers can end up paying thousands of dollars more than they needed to. \r\n This document may also be available in the following languages: Chinese, English, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese, among others. \r\n Note: Last revision 1998.  Use this information as a general guide only;  consult with a local consumer group for laws specific to your state. \r\n How much coverage do I need? \r\n How much money will your survivors need?  If you provide all of your family's income, you will need enough coverage for your dependents to live on until they have another source of income.  Consider how long it will be until your spouse can find employment.  Or if you are a single parent, how much money will relatives or friends need to support your children.  How long will it be until your children are grown and supporting themselves?  If your children are very young, you may need more coverage than if they are teenagers. \r\n You might want to include potential expenses such as funeral and burial costs;  estate, income or property taxes, child careand education. \r\n Consider your family's current income, assets (such as savings, investments, and property), regular expenses and debts (such ascar loans, mortgage, credit cards).  Subtract any income your survivors would have from other sources, such as Social Security benefits, pensions or insurance provided by your employer. \r\n Who doesn't need life insurance? \r\n You probably don't need life insurance if you are single with no dependents, or if your spouse has enough income to live on and cover your final expenses, such as your funeral and the handling of your legal affairs. \r\n What kind of insurance should I buy? \r\n There are two basic types of life insurance: term and cash-value.  (See the \"Term\" and \"Cash-Value\" sections of this fact sheet.)  During any sales presentation, make sure you know which one is being talked about. \r\n Generally, term insurance is a more cost effective choice for young families and for healthy people in their 20s, 30s and 40s.  Many people who buy cash-value insurance view it as an investment, a tax shelter or a way to pay off estate taxes without burdening their heirs. \r\n Term insurance \r\n Term insurance covers policy holders for a fixed span of time, such as 5, 10 or 25 years. \r\n You pay a premium (payment) in return for a death benefit (the lump sum that will be paid to your survivors if you die while the policy is in force). \r\n At any given company, the more your premium is, the more your death benefit will be.  Premiums vary among companies, so shop around. \r\n Policy holders have a choice of two types of premiums: level-term and annual renewal.  Level-term premiums are the same throughout the life of the policy, but increase if you choose to renew.  Annual renewable premiums increase each year as you age.  Level premiums are usually higher than renewable premiums in the first few years of the policy, but lower in later years. \r\n When the term is up, you have three choices: \r\n1.\t Drop the policy if you no longer need life insurance protection. \r\n 2.\t Renew the policy.  If you have a \"guaranteed renewable\" policy you do not need to have a physical exam to renew-otherwise you will have to have an exam.  Your premiums always increase when you renew a term policy.  If your check-up uncovers any health problems, your premium will be even higher. \r\n 3.\t Convert it to a cash-value policy.  Most policies have a \"conversion feature\" that allows you to switch without having a physical check-up.  If you accept this option, your annual premium could increase by up to 20%.  (See the \"Cash-value insurance\" section.) \r\n Cash-value \r\n Cash-value insurance is also known as \"permanent\" insurance because it is sold for indefinite periods.  Variations on cash-value insurance include whole life, universal life, and variable life. \r\n Cash-value policies divide your premiums (payments).  The insurer uses some to pay for the amount due your survivors if you die (called the death benefit) and puts the rest in a reserve fund, where it builds up like savings, and may earn income from dividends or interest.  If you decide to end the policy, you get some of the savings back (the cash surrender value).  But first the insurer deducts commissions, expenses and other fees. \r\n The premiums for cash-value policies are considerably higher than for term policies. \r\n Cash-value insurance includes three common types of policies: \r\n1.\t Whole life remains in effect for the lifetime of the insured or until you no longer pay the premiums and the policy lapses.  The rate of return (earnings) on the cash-value portion of whole life historically has lagged behind other investments, such as stock mutual funds. \r\n 2.\t Universal life allows the customer flexibility in choosing and changing the terms of the policy.  As long as you pay the minimum required to maintain the death benefit, you can choose how much you add to the reserve fund. \r\n 3.\t Variable life gives the policy holder the choice of investing in stocks, bonds and money market funds. \r\n Insurance discrimination \r\n Insurers cannot deny your application - or charge higher premiums - solely because of your sex, marital status, race, religion, national origin or ancestry, or because you are mentally or physically handicapped.  (In some states, your sexual orientation is included.) \r\n Discrimination against non-English speakers based on language may be covered under \"national origin or ancestry\" protection.  Civil rights and unfair business practices laws may also protect people from being discriminated against because they do not speak English. \r\n For advice and referrals on language discrimination, call one of these agencies: \r\n•\tThe Language Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties. \r\n •\tUnion and Employment Law Center at (800) 864-1664. \r\n •\tThe Puerto Rican Legal Defense & Educational Fund at (212) 219-3360. \r\n •\tThe Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund. \r\n •\tThe Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium at (202) 296-2300. \r\n Planning your funeral \r\n Funerals can be a major expense.  You might want to spare your survivors expense and trouble by making sure your life insurance coverage is enough to pay for your funeral and burial expenses. \r\n In order to decide how much to allow for funeral expenses, you can compare options now.  Funeral establishments have \"preplanning\" services that help you figure the potential costs as well as provide a future record of your preferences.  Preplanning, a service available at little or no cost, does not require \"prepaying\" (paying in advance) for your funeral. \r\n Choices for taking care of funeral expenses in advance include investing in a state-regulated trust account (also called \"preneed plans\") or through a special life insurance policy.  Before you sign a contract for either service, check that the company is licensed by calling the appropriate government regulatory agency in your state. \r\n Buying insurance \r\n There are different ways to buy life insurance: \r\nThrough an agent or broker: Agents and brokers are paid through commissions deducted from your premiums in the first few years your policy is in effect.  They may try to sell you the policy that gives them the biggest commission-not the one that provides you with the most value. \r\n A good agent has a broad knowledge of the industry and can guide you to the best choice for your needs.  A good agent will be happy to give you a thorough description of the insurance policy you are considering, and will not hesitate to put the offer in writing for you to take home and study at your leisure.  A good agent will not pressure you to buy insurance. \r\n Through insurance companies or banks: You can save money by dealing with an insurance company directly.  Some savings banks and commercial banks also sell term life insurance, usually through only one company.  Make sure you call several insurers and/or banks to compare prices. \r\n Through your employer or associations that you belong to: Group rates on insurance tend to be lower and you may be able to avoid a medical exam. \r\n Shop around! \r\n Don't buy a policy without getting quotes from several agents or companies - you could end up paying thousands of dollars more than you need to.  Ask your attorney, accountant or financial adviser for recommendations.  Compare not only premiums, but cash-value, death benefits and fees. \r\n Before you buy \r\n •\tMake sure the insurance agent you are dealing with is licensed, by calling your state insurance department.  To find this number, look in the state government section in the front of your white pages phone book, or call directory assistance.  Ask the agent if she or he is certified as a Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) or Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). \r\n •\tLife insurance is a long-term commitment.  It's important that your insurer is financially stable.  Check out the company with a free insurance rating service such as Standard & Poor's at (212) 208-1527;  Moody's at (212) 553-0377;  or Duff & Phelps at (312) 368-3198.  Ask about the highest ratings each service gives.  Stick to companies that have had high ratings for five years or more. \r\n Applying for Life Insurance \r\n How do I qualify?  Applicants for life insurance usually have to have a physical check-up by a doctor chosen by the insurance company.  People who represent the greatest risk to the company, because of age, illness or dangerous work, for example, pay the most for insurance-if they are able to get a policy at all. \r\n What affects my premium?  Life insurance company underwriters - experts who predict risks of injury, illness and death - look at your age, health, occupation, hobbies and habits, as well as your credit report, in setting your premiums. \r\n Smokers pay more for life insurance.  Overweight people are usually charged more.  Many companies charge women less since they have a longer life expectancy, but there are some that have the same rates for women and men. \r\n Fraud and false statements.  When purchasing insurance, you will have to fill out an application form.  Answer all questions truthfully;  insurers double check your answers against your medical and credit records.  A false statement can be enough reason for an insurer to refuse to pay your claim."

        "text":"It seems mad, but I have seen mad things be true, and I am curious.”  I hesitated before asking my other question.  “You said who knows the Lethani cannot lose a fight.”\r\n “Yes.  But not with word fires.  The Lethani is a type of knowing.”  Tempi paused, obviously considering his words carefully.  “Lethani is most important thing.  All Adem learn.  Mercenary learn twice.  Shehyn learn three times.  Most important.  But complicated.  Lethani is . . .  many things.  But nothing touched or pointed to.  Adem spend whole lives thinking on the Lethani.  Very hard.\r\n “Problem,” he said.  “It is not my place to teach my leader.  But you are my student in language.  Women teach the Lethani.  I am not such.  It is part of civilization and you are a barbarian.”  Gentle sorrow.  “But you want to be civilization.  And you have need of the Lethani.”\r\n “Explain it,” I said.  “I will try to understand.”\r\n He nodded.  “The Lethani is doing right things.”\r\n I waited patiently for him to continue.  After a minute, he gestured, frustration.  “Now you ask questions.”  He took a deep breath and repeated.  “The Lethani is doing right things.”\r\n I tried to think of an archetypical example of something good.  “So the Lethani is giving a hungry child food to eat.”\r\n He made the wavering motion that meant, yes and no.  “The Lethani is not doing a thing.  Lethani is the thing that shows us.”\r\n “Lethani means rules?  Laws?”\r\n Tempi shook his head.  “No.”  He gestured to the forest around us.  “Law is from outside, controlling.  It is the . . . the horse mouth metal.  And the head strings.”  Questioning.\r\n “Bridle and bit?”  I suggested.  Motioning as if pulling a horse’s head about with a pair of reins.\r\n “Yes.  Law is bridle and bit.  It controls from outside.  The Lethani . .  .”  He pointed between his eyes, then at his chest.  “. . .  lives inside.  Lethani helps decide.  Law is made because many have no understanding of Lethani.”\r\n “So with the Lethani a person does not need to follow the law.”\r\n Pause.  “Perhaps.”  Frustration.  He drew out his sword and held it parallel to the ground, its edge pointing up.  “If you were small, walking this sword would be like the Lethani.”\r\n “Painful for feet?”  I asked, trying to lighten the mood a bit.  Amusement.\r\n Anger.  Disapproval.  “No.  Difficult to walk.  Easy to fall on one side.  Difficult to stay.”\r\n “The Lethani is very straight?”\r\n “No.”  Pause.  “What is it called when there is many mountain and one place for walking?”\r\n “A path?  A pass?”\r\n “Pass.”  Tempi nodded.  “The Lethani is like a pass in the mountains.  Bends.  Complicated.  Pass is easy way through.  Only way through.  But not easy to see.  Path that is easy much times not go through mountains.  Sometimes goes nowhere.  Starve.  Fall onto hole.”\r\n “So the Lethani is the right way through the mountains.”\r\n Partial agreement.  Excitement.  “It is the right way through the mountains.  But the Lethani is also knowing the right way.  Both.  And mountains are not just mountains.  Mountains are everything.”\r\n “So the Lethani is civilization.”\r\n Pause.  Yes and no.  Tempi shook his head.  Frustrated.\r\n I thought back to what he had said about mercenaries having to learn the Lethani twice.  “Is the Lethani fighting?”  I asked.\r\n “No.”\r\n He said this with such absolute certainty that I had to ask the opposite to make sure.  “Is the Lethani not fighting?”\r\n “No.  One who knows the Lethani knows when to fight and not fight.”  Very important.\r\n I decided to change directions.  “Was it of the Lethani for you to fight today?”\r\n “Yes.  To show Adem is not afraid.  We know with barbarians, not fighting is coward.  Coward is weak.  Not good for them to think.  So with many watching, fight.  Also, to show one Adem is worth many.”\r\n “What if they had won?”\r\n “Then barbarians know Tempi is not worth many.”  Slight amusement.\r\n “If they had won, would today’s fight be not of the Lethani?”\r\n “No.  If you fall and break a leg in mountain pass, it is still the pass.  If I fail while following the Lethani, it is still the Lethani.”  Serious.  “This is why we are talking now.  Today.  With your knife.  That was not the Lethani.  It was not a right thing.”\r\n “I was afraid you would be hurt.”\r\n “The Lethani does not put down roots in fear,” he said, sounding as if he were reciting.\r\n “Would it be the Lethani to let you be hurt?”\r\n A shrug.  “Perhaps.”\r\n “Would it be of the Lethani to let you be . .  .”  Extreme emphasis.  “Hurt?”\r\n “Perhaps no.  But they did not.  To be first with the knife is not of the Lethani.  If you win and are first with the knife, you do not win.”  Vast disapproval.\r\n I couldn’t puzzle out what he meant by the last.  “I don’t understand,” I said.\r\n “The Lethani is right action.  Right way.  Right time.”  Tempi’s face suddenly lit up.  “The old trader man,” he said with visible enthusiasm.  “In the stories with the packs.  What is the word?”\r\n “Tinker?”\r\n “Yes.  The tinker.  How you must treat such men?”\r\n I knew, but I wanted to see what the Adem thought.  “How?”\r\n He looked at me, his fingers pressing together irritation.  “You must be kind, and help them.  And speak well.  Always polite.  Always.”\r\n I nodded.  “And if they offer something, you must consider buying it.”\r\n Tempi made a triumphant gesture.  “Yes!  You can do many things when meeting tinker.  But there is only one right thing.”  He calmed himself a little.  Caution.  “But only doing is not the Lethani.  First knowing, then doing.  That is the Lethani.”\r\n I thought on this for a moment.  “So being polite is the Lethani?”\r\n “Not polite.  Not kind.  Not good.  Not duty.  The Lethani is none of these.  Each moment.  Each choice.  All different.”  He gave me a penetrating look.  “Do you understand?”\r\n “No.”\r\n Happiness.  Approval.  Tempi got to his feet, nodding.  “It is good you know you do not.  Good that you say.  That is also of the Lethani.”\r\n CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT Listening\r\n Tempi and I returned to find the camp surprisingly cheerful.  Dedan and Hespe were smiling at each other and Marten had managed to shoot a wild turkey for dinner.\r\n So we ate and joked.  And after the washing up was done, Hespe told her story about the boy who loved the moon, starting again at the beginning.  Dedan kept his mouth miraculously shut, and I dared to hope our little group was finally, finally starting to become a team.\r\n\r\n Jax had no trouble following the moon because in those days the moon was always full.  She hung in the sky, round as a cup, bright as a candle, all unchanging.\r\n Jax walked for days and days until his feet grew sore.  He walked for months and months and his back grew tired beneath his packs.  He walked for years and years and grew up tall and lean and hard and hungry.\r\n When he needed food, he traded out of the tinker’s packs.  When his shoes wore thin he did the same. "

I'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment.  That's how I refuel.\"\r\n\r\n “Anyone who does not believe in miracles is not a realist.” \r\n\r\n “I believe in manicures.  I believe in overdressing.  I believe in primping at leisure and wearing lipstick.  I believe in pink.  I believe happy girls are the prettiest girls.  I believe that tomorrow is another day, and...

        "text":"Jax made his own way, and he grew up clever and sly.\r\n Through it all, Jax thought about the moon.  When he began to think he couldn’t go another step, he’d put on his spectacles and look up at her, round-bellied in the sky.  And when he saw her he would feel a slow stirring in his chest.  And in time he came to think he was in love.\r\n Eventually the road Jax followed passed through Tinue, as all roads do.  Still he walked, following the great stone road east toward the mountains.\r\n The road climbed and climbed.  He ate the last of his bread and the last of his cheese.  He drank the last of his water and the last of his wine.  He walked for days without either, the moon growing larger in the night sky above him.\r\n Just as his strength was failing, Jax climbed over a rise and found an old man sitting in the mouth of a cave.  He had a long grey beard and a long grey robe.  He had no hair on the top of his head, or shoes on the bottom of his feet.  His eyes were open and his mouth was closed.\r\n His face lit up when he saw Jax.  He came to his feet and smiled.  “Hello, hello,” he said, his voice bright and rich.  “You’re a long way from anywhere.  How is the road to Tinue?”\r\n “It’s long,” Jax said.  “And hard and weary.”\r\n The old man invited Jax to sit.  He brought him water and goat’s milk and fruit to eat.  Jax ate hungrily, then offered the man a pair of shoes from his pack in trade.\r\n “No need, no need,” the old man said happily, wiggling his toes.  “But thanks for offering all the same.”\r\n Jax shrugged.  “As you will.  But what are you doing here, so far from everything?”\r\n “I found this cave when I was out chasing the wind,” the old man said.  “I decided to stay because this place is perfect for what I do.”\r\n “And what is that?”  Jax asked.\r\n “I am a listener,” the old man said.  “I listen to things to see what they have to say.”\r\n “Ah,” Jax said carefully.  “And this is a good place for that?”\r\n “Quite good.  Quite excellent good,” the old man said.  “You need to get a long ways away from people before you can learn to listen properly.”  He smiled.  “What brings you out to my little corner of the sky?”\r\n “I am trying to find the moon.”\r\n “That’s easy enough,” the old man said, gesturing to the sky.  “We see her most every night, weather permitting.”\r\n “No.  I’m trying to catch her.  If I could be with her, I think I could be happy.”\r\n The old man looked at him seriously.  “You want to catch her, do you?  How long have you been chasing?”\r\n “More years and miles than I can count.”\r\n The old man closed his eyes for a moment, then nodded to himself.  “I can hear it in your voice.  This is no passing fancy.”  He leaned close and pressed his ear to Jax’s chest.  He closed his eyes for another long moment and was very still.  “Oh,” he said softly.  “How sad.  Your heart is broken and you’ve never even had a chance to use it.”\r\n Jax moved around, a little uncomfortable.  “If you don’t mind my asking,” Jax said, “What’s your name?”\r\n “I don’t mind you asking,” the old man said.  “So long as you don’t mind me not telling.  If you had my name, I’d be under your power, wouldn’t I?”\r\n “Would you?”  Jax asked.\r\n “Of course.”  The old man frowned.  “That is the way of things.  Though you don’t seem to be much for listening, it’s best to be careful.  If you managed to catch hold of even just a piece of my name, you’d have all manner of power over me.”\r\n Jax wondered if this man might be able to help him.  While he didn’t seem to be terribly ordinary, Jax knew he was on no ordinary errand.  If he’d been trying to catch a cow, he would ask a farmer’s help.  But to catch the moon, perhaps he needed the help of an odd old man.  “You said you used to chase the wind,” Jax said.  “Did you ever catch it?”\r\n “In some ways yes,” the old man said.  “And in other ways, no.  There are many ways of looking at that question, you see.”\r\n “Could you help me catch the moon?”\r\n “I might be able to give you some advice,” the old man said reluctantly.  “But first you should think this over, boy.  When you love something, you have to make sure it loves you back, or you’ll bring about no end of trouble chasing it.”\r\n Hespe didn’t look at Dedan as she said this.  She looked everywhere in the world but at him.  Because of this, she didn’t see the stricken, helpless look on his face.\r\n “How can I find out if she loves me?”  Jax asked.\r\n “You could try listening,” the old man said, almost shyly.  “It works wonders, you know.  I could teach you how.”\r\n “How long would that take?”\r\n “A couple years,” the old man said.  “Give or take.  It depends on if you have a knack for it.  It’s tricky, proper listening.  But once you have it, you’ll know the moon down to the bottoms of her feet.”\r\n Jax shook his head.  “Too long.  If I can catch her, I can talk with her.  I can make — ”\r\n “Well that’s part of your problem right there,” the old man said.  “You don’t really want to catch her.  Not really.  Will you trail her through the sky?  Of course not.  You want to meet her.  That means you need the moon to come to you.”\r\n “How can I do that?”  he said.\r\n The old man smiled.  “Well that’s the question, isn’t it?  What do you have that the moon might want?  What do you have to offer the moon?”\r\n “Only what I have in these packs.”\r\n “That’s not quite what I meant,” the old man muttered.  “But we might as well take a look at what you’ve brought, too.”\r\n The old hermit looked through the first pack and found many practical things.  The contents of the second pack were more expensive and rare, but no more useful.\r\n Then the old man saw the third pack.  “And what do you have in there?”\r\n “I’ve never been able to get it open,” Jax said.  “The knot is too much for me.”\r\n The hermit closed his eyes for a moment, listening.  Then he opened his eyes and frowned at Jax.  “The knot says you tore at it.  Pricked it with a knife.  Bit it with your teeth.”\r\n Jax was surprised.  “I did,” he admitted.  “I told you, I tried everything to get it open.”\r\n “Hardly everything,” the hermit said scornfully.  He lifted the pack until the knotted cord was in front of his face.  “I’m terribly sorry,” he said.  “But would you open up?”  He paused.  “Yes.  I apologize.  He won’t do it again.”\r\n The knot unraveled and the hermit opened the pack.  Looking inside, his eyes widened and he let out a low whistle.\r\n But when the old man spread the pack open on the ground, Jax’s shoulders slumped.  He had been hoping for money, or gems, some treasure he could give the moon as a gift.  But all the pack held was a bent piece of wood, a stone flute, and a small iron box.\r\n Of these, only the flute caught Jax’s attention.  It was made of a pale green stone.  “I had a flute when I was younger,” Jax said.  “But it broke and I could never make it right again.”\r\n “They’re all quite impressive,” the hermit said.\r\n “The flute is nice enough,” Jax said with a shrug.  “But what use is a piece of wood and a box too small for anything practical?”\r\n The hermit shook his head.  “Can’t you hear them?  Most things whisper.  These things shout.”  He pointed at the piece of crooked wood.  “That is a folding house unless I miss my guess.  Quite a nice one too.”\r\n “What’s a folding house?”\r\n “You know how you can fold a piece of paper on itself, and each time it gets smaller?”  the old man gestured at the piece of crooked wood.  “A folding house is like that.  Except it’s a house, of course.”\r\n Jax took hold of the piece of crooked wood and tried to straighten it.  Suddenly he was holding two pieces of wood that resembled the beginning of a doorframe.\r\n “Don’t unfold it here!”  the old man shouted.  “I don’t want a house outside my cave, blocking my sunlight!”\r\n Jax tried to push the two pieces of wood, back together.  “Why can’t I fold it back up?”\r\n “Because you don’t know how, I expect,” the old man said plainly.  “I suggest you wait until you know where you want it before you unfold it the rest of the way.”\r\n Jax set the wood down carefully, then picked up the flute.  “Is this special too?”  He put it to his lips and blew a simple trill like a Will’s Widow.\r\n Hespe smiled teasingly, lifted a familiar wooden whistle to her lips, and blew: Ta-ta DEE.  Ta-ta DEE.\r\n Now everyone knows the Will’s Widow is also called a nightjar.  So it isn’t out when the sun is shining.  Despite this, a dozen nightjars flew down and landed all around Jax, looking at him curiously and blinking in the bright sunlight.\r\n “It seems to be more than the usual flute,” the old man said.\r\n “And the box?”  Jax reached out and picked it up.  It was dark, and cold, and small enough that he could close his hand around it.\r\n The old man shivered and looked away from the box.  “It’s empty.”\r\n “How can you tell without seeing inside?”\r\n “By listening,” he said.  “I’m amazed you can’t hear it yourself.  It’s the emptiest thing I’ve ever heard.  It echoes.  It’s meant for keeping things inside.”\r\n “All boxes are meant for keeping things inside.”\r\n “And all flutes are meant to play beguiling music,” the old man pointed out.  “But this flute is moreso.  The same is true with this box.”\r\n Jax looked at the box for a moment, then set it down carefully and began to tie up the third pack with the three treasures inside it.  “I think I’ll be moving on,” Jax said.\r\n “Are you sure you won’t consider staying for a month or two?”  the old man said.  “You could learn to listen just a bit more closely.  Useful thing, listening.”\r\n “You’ve given me some things to think about,” Jax said.  “And I think you’re right, I shouldn’t be chasing the moon.  I should make the moon come to me.”\r\n “That’s not what I actually said,” the old man murmured.  But he did so in a resigned way.  Skilled listener that he was, he knew he wasn’t being heard.\r\n Jax set off the next morning, following the moon higher into the mountains.  Eventually he found a large, flat piece of ground nestled high among the tallest peaks.\r\n Jax brought out the crooked piece of wood and, piece by piece, began to unfold the house.  With the whole night in front of him, he was hoping to have it finished well before the moon began to rise.\r\n But the house was much larger than he had guessed, more a mansion than a simple cottage.

        "text":"What’s more, unfolding it was more complicated than he had expected.  By the time the moon reached the top of the sky, he was still far from being finished.\r\n Perhaps Jax hurried because of this.  Perhaps he was reckless.  Or perhaps it was just that Jax was unlucky as ever.\r\n In the end the result was the same: the mansion was magnificent, huge and sprawling.  But it didn’t fit together properly.  There were stairways that led sideways instead of up.  Some rooms had too few walls, or too many.  Many rooms had no ceiling, and high above they showed a strange sky full of unfamiliar stars.\r\n Everything about the place was slightly skewed.  In one room you could look out the window at the springtime flowers, while across the hall the windows were filmed with winter’s frost.  It could be time for breakfast in the ballroom, while twilight filled a nearby bedroom.\r\n Because nothing in the house was true, none of the doors or windows fit tight.  They could be closed, even locked, but never made fast.  And as big as it was, the mansion had a great many doors and windows, so there were a great many ways both in and out.\r\n Jax paid no mind to any of this.  Instead, he raced to the top of the highest tower and put the flute to his lips.\r\n He poured out a sweet song into the clear night sky.  No simple bird trill, this was a song that came from his broken heart.  It was strong and sad.  It fluttered like a bird with a broken wing.\r\n Hearing it, the moon came down to the tower.  Pale and round and beautiful, she stood before Jax in all her glory, and for the first time in his life he felt a single breath of joy.\r\n They spoke then, on the top of the tower.  Jax telling her of his life, his wager, and his long, lonely journey.  The moon listened, and laughed, and smiled.\r\n But eventually she looked longingly toward the sky.\r\n Jax knew what this foretold.  “Stay with me,” he pleaded.  “I can only be happy if you’re mine.”\r\n “I must go,” she said.  “The sky is my home.”\r\n “I have made a home for you,” Jax said, gesturing to the vast mansion below them.  “There is sky enough for you here.  An empty sky that is all for you.”\r\n “I must go,” she said.  “I have been away too long.”\r\n He raised his hand as if to grab her, then stopped himself.  “Time is what we make it here,” he said.  “Your bedroom can be winter or spring, all according to your desire.”\r\n “I must go,” she said, looking upward.  “But I will return.  I am always and unchanging.  And if you play your flute for me, I will visit you again.”\r\n “I have given you three things,” he said.  “A song, a home, and my heart.  If you must go, will you not give me three things in return?”\r\n She laughed, holding her hands out to her sides.  She was naked as the moon.  “What do I have that I can leave with you?  But if it is mine to give, ask and I will give it.”\r\n Jax found his mouth was dry.  “First I would ask for a touch of your hand.”\r\n “One hand clasps another, and I grant you your request.”  She reached out to him, her hand smooth and strong.  At first it seemed cool, then marvelously warm.  Gooseflesh ran all up and down Jax’s arms.\r\n “Second, I would beg a kiss,” he said.\r\n “One mouth tastes another, and I grant you your request.”  She leaned in close to him.  Her breath was sweet, her lips firm as fruit.  The kiss pulled the breath out of Jax, and for the first time in his life, his mouth curved into the beginning of a smile.\r\n “And what is the third thing?”  the moon asked.  Her eyes were dark and wise, her smile was full and knowing.\r\n “Your name,” Jax breathed.  “That I might call you by it.”\r\n “One body . .  .” the moon began, stepping forward eagerly.  Then she paused.  “Only my name?”  she asked, sliding her hand around his waist.\r\n Jax nodded.\r\n She leaned close and spoke warmly against his ear, “Ludis.”\r\n And Jax brought out the black iron box, closing the lid and catching her name inside.\r\n “Now I have your name,” he said firmly.  “So I have mastery over you.  And I say you must stay with me forever, so I can be happy.”\r\n And so it was.  The box was no longer cold in his hand.  It was warm, and inside he could feel her name, fluttering like a moth against a windowpane.\r\n Perhaps Jax had been too slow in closing the box.  Perhaps he fumbled with the clasp.  Or perhaps he was simply unlucky in all things.  But in the end he only managed to catch a piece of the moon’s name, not the thing entire.\r\n So Jax could keep her for a while, but she always slips away from him.  Out from his broken mansion, back to our world.  But still, he has a piece of her name, and so she always must return.\r\n\r\n Hespe looked around at us, smiling.  “And that is why the moon is always changing.  And that is where Jax keeps her when she is not in our sky.  He caught her and he keeps her still.  But whether or not he is happy is only for him to know.”\r\n There was a long moment of silence.\r\n “That,” Dedan said, “is one hell of a story.”\r\n Hespe looked down, and though the firelight made it difficult to tell, I would have bet a penny she was blushing.  Hard Hespe, who I wouldn’t have guessed had a drop of blushing in her.  “It took me a long time to remember all of it,” she said, “My mother used to tell it to me when I was a little girl.  Every night, always the same.  Said she learned it from her mother.”\r\n “Well you’ll need to make sure you tell your daughters, too,” Dedan said.  “A story like that is too good to let fall by the roadside.”\r\n Hespe smiled.\r\n\r\n Unfortunately, that peaceful evening was like the lull that comes in the center of a storm.  The next day Hespe made a comment that sent Dedan off in a huff, and for two hours they could barely look at each other without hissing like angry cats.\r\n Dedan tried to convince everyone we should give up our search and instead sign up as caravan guards, hoping the bandits would attack us.  Marten said that made as much sense as trying to find a bear trap by putting your foot in it.  Marten was right, but that didn’t keep Dedan and the tracker from snapping at each other over the next couple days.\r\n Two days later, Hespe gave a surprisingly girlish shriek of alarm while bathing.  We ran to her assistance, expecting bandits, and instead found Tempi naked, knee-deep in the stream.  Hespe stood half-dressed and dripping wet on the shore.  Marten thought it was hilarious.  Hespe did not.  And the only thing that kept Dedan from flying into a rage and attacking Tempi was the fact that he couldn’t figure out how to attack a naked man without looking in his direction or actually touching him.\r\n The day after that, the weather grew foggy and damp, souring everyone’s mood and slowing our search even further.\r\n Then it began to rain.\r\n CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE Losing the Light\r\n The last four days had been endlessly overcast and raining.  At first the trees had given us some shelter, but we soon discovered that the leaves overhead merely held the rain, and the slightest stir of wind sent down showers of heavy drops that had been gathering for hours.  This meant that whether or not it was currently raining, we were constantly dripped upon and damp.\r\n Stories after supper had stopped.  Marten caught a cold, and as it worsened he grew sullen and sarcastic.  And two days ago the bread had gotten wet.  This might sound like a small thing, but if you’ve ever tried to eat a piece of wet bread after a day of walking in the rain, you know what sort of mood it puts you in.\r\n Dedan had grown truly unmanageable.  He balked and complained at the simplest of tasks.  The last time he had gone into town for supplies, he had bought a bottle of dreg instead of potatoes, butter, and bowstrings.  Hespe left him behind at Crosson and he didn’t get back to camp until nearly midnight, stinking drunk and singing loud enough to make the dead cover their ears.\r\n I didn’t bother telling him off.  Sharp as my trouper’s tongue was, he was obviously immune to it.  Instead I waited until he passed out, poured the remaining dreg on the fire, and left the bottle sitting in the coals for him to see.  After that, he stopped his constant derogatory muttering about me and settled into chilly silence.  While the quiet was nice, I knew it was a bad sign.\r\n Given everyone’s rising temper, I’d decided each of us would search for trail sign on our own.  This was partly because walking in someone’s footsteps over wet turf was a sure way to tear up the ground and leave a trail.  But the other reason is that I knew if I sent Dedan and Hespe out together, their eventual argument would alert any bandit within ten miles.\r\n\r\n I came back to camp dripping wet and miserable.  It turns out the boots I’d bought in Severen didn’t have a lick of waterproofing, so they drank rainwater like sponges.  In the evening I could dry them out using the heat of the fire and a little careful sympathy.  But as soon as I took three steps they were soaked through again.  So on top of everything my feet had been cold and damp for days.\r\n It was our twenty-ninth day in the Eld, and when I came over the tiny ridge that hid our latest camp, I saw Dedan and Hespe sitting on opposite sides of the fire, ignoring each other.  Hespe was oiling her sword.  Dedan was idly jabbing the ground in front of him with a pointed stick.\r\n I wasn’t in much mood for conversation myself.  Hoping the silence held, I went wordlessly to the fire.\r\n Except there was no fire.\r\n “What happened to the fire?”  I asked stupidly.  What had happened was rather obvious.  It had been left to burn down to charred sticks and damp ashes.\r\n “It’s not my turn to get wood,” Hespe said pointedly.\r\n Dedan poked at the dirt with his stick.  I noticed the beginnings of a bruise high on his cheek.\r\n All I wanted in the world was a little something hot to eat and ten minutes with dry feet.  It wouldn’t make me happy, but it would bring me closer to happy than I’d been all day.  “I’m surprised the two of you can piss without help,” I spat.\r\n Dedan glared up at me.  “Just what do you mean by that?”\r\n “When Alveron asked me to do this job for him, he implied I would have adults helping me, not a handful of schoolchildren.”\r\n Dedan’s snapped.  “You don’t know what she — ”\r\n I cut him off.  “I don’t care.  I don’t care what you’re bickering about.  I don’t care what she threw at you.  I care that the fire is out.  Tehlu above, a trained dog would be more help!”\r\n Dedan’s expression firmed into a familiar belligerence.  “Maybe if — ”\r\n “Shut up,” I said.  “I would rather listen to a jackass braying than waste my time with whatever you’re saying.  When I come back to camp I expect fire and a meal.  If this is beyond you, I’ll arrange to have some five-year-old come out from Crosson and babysit the both of you.”\r\n Dedan stood.  The wind gusted in the trees above us, sending down heavy drops to patter on the ground.  “You’re on your way to a meal you won’t be able to stomach, boy.”\r\n His hands clenched into fists, and I reached into my pocket to grip the mommet I had made of him two days ago.  I felt my stomach clench in fear and fury.  “Dedan, if you take a single step toward me, I will lay such pain on you that you will scream for me to kill you.”  I stared him square in the eye.  “Right now I am irritated.  Do not even think of making me angry.”\r\n He paused, and I could almost hear him thinking of every story he had ever heard about Taborlin the Great.  Fire and lightning.  There was a moment of long silence as the two of us stared at each other, unblinking.\r\n Luckily, at this point Tempi returned to camp, breaking the tension.  Feeling a little foolish, I went to the embers of the fire to see if I could rekindle it.  Dedan stomped into the trees, hopefully in search of wood.  At this point I didn’t care if it was rennel or not.\r\n Tempi sat by the side of the dead fire.  Perhaps if I hadn’t been busy I might have noticed something odd in his movement.  Then again, perhaps not.  Even for a semieducated barbarian such as myself, the moods of the Adem are difficult to read.\r\n As I coaxed the fire slowly back to life, I began to regret how I had handled things.  That thought alone kept me from lashing out at Dedan when he returned with an armload of wet wood and dropped it at the edge of my newly rebuilt fire, scattering it.\r\n Marten came back shortly after I had rebuilt the fire a second time.  He settled at the edge of it and spread his hands.  His eyes were sunken and dark.\r\n “Feeling any better?”  I asked him.\r\n “Loads.”  His voice rasped wetly in his chest, sounding worse than it had this morning.  I worried about the sound of his breathing, about pneumonia, about fever.\r\n “I can mix you a tea that will make your throat a little easier,” I suggested without much hope.  He’d rejected all my offers of help over the last several days.\r\n He hesitated, then nodded.  As I was heating the water he had a fit of violent coughing that lasted nearly a minute.  If the rain didn’t stop tonight we would have to head into town and wait for him to recover.  I couldn’t risk him catching pneumonia or giving away our position to bandit sentries with a coughing fit.\r\n I handed him his tea, and Tempi stirred in his seat by the edge of the fire.  “I killed two men today,” he said.\r\n There was a long moment of stunned silence.  Rain pattered on the ground around us.  The fire hissed and spat.\r\n “What?”  I asked incredulously.\r\n “I was attack by two men behind trees,” Tempi said calmly.\r\n I rubbed the back of my neck.  “Dammit Tempi, why didn’t you say something before?”\r\n He gave me a level look and his fingers made an unfamiliar circle.  “It is not easy to kill two men,” he said.\r\n “Are you hurt?”  Hespe asked.\r\n Tempi turned his cool look on her next.  Offended.  I’d misunderstood his previous comment.  It wasn’t the fight itself he had found difficult. "

        "text":"UX Design Defined\r\n By Ritch Macefield\r\n Published: June 18, 2012\r\n\r\n “In the field of user experience, people often confuse terms like information architecture, interaction design, visual design, usability engineering, and UX design.”\r\n Unfortunately, in the field of user experience, people often confuse terms like information architecture, interaction design, visual design, usability engineering, and UX design.  In some cases, people use these terms almost interchangeably.  This article provides a lexicon of these terms and more clearly defines the role of the user experience designer.\r\n\r\n Information Architecture\r\n\r\n Information architecture (IA) focuses on the organization of data — that is, how data is structured from a user’s perspective, as opposed to the system, or technical, perspective.\r\n\r\n At the level of an entire Web site, or application, information architecture determines what data is on each page and how pages relate to each other.  For example, defining a site map is an IA activity.  At the level of an individual page layout, information architecture ensures that data is logically grouped and interrelated.\r\n\r\n “Information architecture (IA) focuses on the organization of data….”\r\n A major concern of information architecture is defining and using taxonomies — for example, information hierarchies — and classifying data within these taxonomies.  So, defining menu and navigational structures is an IA issue.  Doing this work successfully often requires eliciting information from users and domain experts, using techniques such as structured interviews and various types of card-sorting exercises.\r\n\r\n Information architecture also concerns applying existing taxonomies when doing new development.  Taxonomies may be proprietary — such as how to classify products a particular retailer offers — or standards such as the UK’s Local Government Category List (LGCL).  So, ensuring that a navigation bar at the left of a page is wide enough to contain all of the terms a particular taxonomy uses is also an IA issue.\r\n\r\n This means that specialists in information architecture often come from an information management or library studies background.  My experience is that some technical data modelers such as those who are excellent at Entity-Relation modelling with relational data bases — for example, with Oracle — or defining class hierarchies — for example, using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) — can also make superb information architects.  This is not just because they understand how an information architecture maps to a technical implementation.  Rather, it is because they have excellent generic skills in eliciting data relationships from users and domain experts, logically organizing data according to defined rules and principles, and abstracting key patterns in the data they’re working with.\r\n\r\n Interaction Design\r\n\r\n “Interaction design concerns the controls, mechanisms, and processes that users require to perform their tasks on systems….”\r\n Interaction design concerns the controls, mechanisms, and processes that users require to perform their tasks on systems and so meet their goals.  For example, an interaction designer determines whether to use a menu rather than a set of tabs, whether to use a drop-down list rather than set of radio buttons, and the process, or steps, for setting up a new email account using a wizard.  This inevitably means that interaction design is about creating affordances — including defining what controls do and how to communicate what they do to users — that is, designing affordances.\r\n\r\n Visual Design\r\n\r\n “Visual design focuses on the aesthetics of a user interface, ensuring that it looks good, communicates the right image to users, and conforms to any brand guidelines.”\r\n Visual design focuses on the aesthetics of a user interface, ensuring that it looks good, communicates the right image to users, and conforms to any brand guidelines.  This means that good visual designers often come from a graphic design background — whether print or online — and often have excellent related skills — for example, illustration, animation, or photography — that they can integrate into their interface design work.\r\n\r\n It is interesting to note here that the ability to design good layouts is a prerequisite for good visual design, good interaction design, and good information architecture, but each of these specialties uses the term layout in ways that are qualitatively different.  This is because their rationale and goals for a layout are very different — visual design seeks good aesthetics;  interaction design, good workflows;  and information architecture, good groupings of information.  Sometimes these things are synergistic, sometimes they’re in competition with one another, and sometimes they’re a bit of both.\r\n\r\n Usability Engineering\r\n\r\n “Usability engineering is primarily about planning and executing various types of usability studies that test how well people can use a user interface….”\r\n Usability engineering is primarily about planning and executing various types of usability studies that test how well people can use a user interface, then making recommendations for how to correct the problems that these studies identify.  These recommendations may be very specific — like “make the OK button a stronger shade of red” — or very general like — “the IA needs revisiting.”\r\n\r\n To conduct usability studies, usability engineers must have skills in questionnaire design, interviewing, test facilitation, and the use of usability testing software such as Morae.  The best usability engineers also have a good grounding in statistics, so they can apply the correct statistical methods and tests to quantitative study results.  They may also be familiar with relevant standards such as ISO 9241 and the Common Industry Format for Usability Testing (ANSI/NCITS 354-2001).\r\n\r\n Having skills in secondary research methods is also important for usability engineers, enabling them to avoid the time and expense of executing a new, or primary, study when a similar study has already been published.  Usability engineers need to be able to identify relevant studies, assess their credibility, and determine the degree to which their findings are relevant to a system they’re evaluating.\r\n\r\n All of this is more difficult than it may sound, which is why the best usability engineers often have a very strong academic background or may still work mainly in academia.\r\n\r\n User Experience Design\r\n\r\n “A visual designer would have a role that is similar to that of an interior designer — choosing the carpets, curtains, and furniture, so they coordinate well, are in keeping with the character of the house, and satisfy the home owners’ personal taste.”\r\n So what is user experience design (UXD)?\r\n\r\n Circa 2000, Melisa Cooper published an article that unfortunately no longer seems to be available online.  It drew an analogy between a User Experience Architect — a more common term than UX Designer in the 1990s — and that of a conventional architect who designs houses.  I have adapted and extended her analogy to make it more comprehensive and contemporary, as well as to put my own spin on things.  When designing a new house:\r\n\r\nAn information architect would ensure that the master bedroom could accommodate a double bed, two bedside tables, and a large wardrobe;  that the kitchen is next to the dining room;  and that the only bathroom is not in the garage!\r\n An interaction designer would ensure that the cold water tap is always on the right, the stairs have banisters, and the light switches are on the correct side of doors.\r\n A visual designer would have a role that is similar to that of an interior designer — choosing the carpets, curtains, and furniture, so they coordinate well, are in keeping with the character of the house, and satisfy the home owners’ personal taste.\r\n A usability engineer would inspect the house after each of the key stages in the building project — that is, after conceptual design, using the architect’s visuals and models;  after the planning stage, referring to the technical schematics;  once the building shell is completed;  and once the entire building is completed.\r\n A UX architect conceives the whole experience of the home owner.  This means having overall responsibility for the design, leading and briefing all of the people in specialist roles, and representing the home owner — not the builders — throughout the design process.\r\n Managing Overlap and Conflict\r\n\r\n “There is a high degree of overlap between the roles of the information architect, interaction designer, visual designer, and usability engineer, so potential for conflict exists across all of them.”\r\n Clearly, there is a high degree of overlap between the roles of the information architect, interaction designer, visual designer, and usability engineer, so potential for conflict exists across all of them.  For example, the positioning of links on a page may relate to an IT system’s information architecture, interaction design, and visual design;  and usability engineers would, of course, test this positioning.  Likewise, a visual designer might design an icon that looks fantastic and is on brand, but which has very low affordance and usability.\r\n\r\n A classic example of overlapping responsibilities — and the conflict that can ensue — occurs in the definition of style guides.  Visual designers often have sole responsibility for style guides — mistakenly in my opinion.  Of course, it’s essential that a style guide meet all visual design requirements;  however, establishing style guidelines is also vital in, for example, communicating hierarchies, which is an IA issue, and affordances, which an interaction design issue.\r\n\r\n This is why a key responsibility of a UX Designer or Architect is managing such overlaps and resolving conflicts across these areas whenever they occur — which they always do!\r\n\r\n The UX Designer’s Skillset\r\n\r\n “Does a UX designer (UXD) need to be highly skilled in all four of these areas: information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and usability engineering?”\r\n Does a UX designer (UXD) need to be highly skilled in all four of these areas: information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and usability engineering?  Well, there are certainly UX designers who are highly skilled in all of these areas, but such a skillset is extremely rare in my experience. "

        "text":" He leaned close, as if whispering to the body.\r\n Then I saw the camp, and all vague curiosity about the Adem’s peculiarity was pushed from my mind.\r\n CHAPTER NINETY-ONE Flame, Thunder, Broken Tree\r\n The ridge we crouched on made a wide half-circle, holding the bandits’ camp in the center of a protective crescent.  The result was that the camp sat at the bottom of a large, shallow bowl.  From our position I could see the open portion of the bowl was bordered by a stream that curved in and away.\r\n The trunk of a towering oak tree rose like a pillar in the center of the bowl, sheltering the camp with its huge branches.  Two fires burned sullenly on either side of the great oak.  Both would have been big as bonfires if not for the weather.  As it was, they merely shed enough light to reveal the camp.\r\n Camp is a misleading term, “encampment” would be better.  There were six field tents, short and sloping, mostly intended for sleeping and storing equipment.  The seventh tent was almost a small pavilion, rectangular and large enough for several men to stand upright.\r\n Six men sat huddled close to the fires on makeshift benches.  They were bundled up against the rain, all of them with the hard-eyed, long-suffering look of experienced soldiers.\r\n I ducked back below the ridgeline and was surprised to feel no fear at all.  I turned to Marten, and saw his eyes were a little wild.  “How many do you think there are?”  I asked.\r\n His eyes flickered thoughtfully.  “At least two to a tent.  If their leader keeps to the big tent that makes thirteen, and we’ve killed three.  So ten.  Ten at the very least.”  He licked his lips nervously.  “But they could be sleeping as many as four to a tent, and the big tent could sleep five more in addition to the leader.  That makes thirty, less three.”\r\n “So at best we’re outnumbered two to one,” I said.  “Do you like those odds?”\r\n His eyes moved to the ridgeline, then back to me.  “I’d take two to one.  We’ve got surprise, we’re right up close.”  He paused and coughed into his sleeve.  He spat.  “But there’s twenty of them down there.  I can feel it in my balls.”\r\n “Can you convince Dedan?”\r\n He nodded.  “He’ll believe me.  He’s not half the ass he seems most of the time.”\r\n “Good.”  I considered briefly.  Things had been happening more quickly than I can tell them aloud.  So despite everything that had happened, Dedan and Hespe were still five or six minutes behind us.  “Go turn the two of them around,” I told Marten.  “Then come back for Tempi and me.”\r\n He looked uncertain.  “You sure you don’t want to come now?  We don’t know when their guard might change.”\r\n “I’ll have Tempi with me.  Besides, it should only take you a couple minutes.  I want to see if I can get a better count of how many there are.”\r\n Marten hurried off, and Tempi and I edged our way back up to the top of the ridge.  After a moment he edged closer until the left side of his body was pressed up against my right.\r\n I noticed something I’d missed earlier.  There were wooden poles the size of tall fenceposts scattered throughout the camp.\r\n “Posts?”  I asked Tempi, driving my finger into the ground to illustrate what I mean.\r\n He nodded to show he understood, then shrugged.\r\n I guessed they might be tethers for horses, or drying poles for sodden clothes.  I pushed it from my mind in favor of more pressing matters.  “What do you think we should do?”\r\n Tempi was silent for a long moment.  “Kill some.  Leave.  Wait.  Others come.  We . .  .” "

        "text":"After nearly 20 years working in this field, I can count the ones I know on one hand!\r\n\r\n However, in my opinion, a UX designer needs to be highly skilled only in information architecture and interaction design — not necessarily in visual design or usability engineering.\r\n\r\n Visual Design and UX Design\r\n\r\n “A UX designer must be able to conceive the vision for the aesthetics of a user interface and manage the visual design process, but does not necessarily need to be skilled enough to actually undertake the visual design.”\r\n It is often a perfectly viable approach for a UX designer to craft a gray-scale wireframe design that is excellent in terms of information architecture and interaction design, then brief a visual designer on skinning it appropriately.  This is analogous to interior designers weaving their magic on a new building.  The activity takes place late in the design process after key design decisions have been made — that is, after the building has gone up.\r\n\r\n Of course, this means UX designers do need to have a good appreciation of visual design, know a good-looking user interface when they see it, and be able to communicate a brief effectively to a visual designer.  UX designers also have to be able to recognize — and know how to fix — the sorts of information architecture and interaction design problems that commonly get introduced during the visual design process.\r\n\r\n To summarize here, I’m arguing that a UX designer must be able to conceive the vision for the aesthetics of a user interface and manage the visual design process, but does not necessarily need to be skilled enough to actually undertake the visual design.\r\n\r\n Usability Engineering and UX Design\r\n\r\n “If a UX designer is like a chief aeronautical engineer who has overall responsibility for the design of a new fighter plane, the usability engineer is like the test pilot.”\r\n Let’s look at another analogy that describes the relationship between usability engineering and UX design.  If a UX designer is like a chief aeronautical engineer who has overall responsibility for the design of a new fighter plane, the usability engineer is like the test pilot.\r\n\r\n The implication here is that, although there is considerable overlap between the knowledge of UX designers and usability engineers, their skill sets are actually quite different!  This is why there are many UX designers who would freely admit that they are not fully qualified to undertake usability studies.  Likewise, there are many excellent usability engineers who would not dream of undertaking responsibility for UX design.\r\n\r\n Rather, the essential skill for a UX designer is the ability to communicate well with usability engineers, ensuring that the right interactions get tested and that they fully understand the findings of a study and its associated recommendations.  Again, just as in the aircraft analogy, a UX designer and a usability engineer being able work in close cooperation and have mutual respect for one another’s specialist skills is essential to a successful design process.  There is certainly no room here for a UX designer taking feedback from a usability engineer as some kind of personal criticism.\r\n\r\n The best UX designers also have reasonable secondary research skills in usability engineering, so they can reuse tested design patterns that have already been proven to work in similar contexts and avoid those that have failed under usability testing.\r\n\r\n We should also recognize that UX designers may also need to call on specialist information architects to help them with particularly challenging parts of a system’s information architecture.  This may be because a specialist in information architecture can simply work more efficiently or because they have expertise in a particular domain or taxonomy.  In my opinion, UX designers should not see this as an admission of weakness in their skillset, but rather as their leveraging a strength: the value that a UX designer adds in recognizing when someone else has greater expertise in a particular area and having the skills to integrate that resource into the overall interface design process.\r\n\r\n The UX Designer’s Profile\r\n\r\n “In … mentoring senior UX designers …, I often ask them to rank themselves on a scale of 1–10 in each of these areas, so they can define their UX profile.”\r\n In this article, I have identified four key areas in which UX designers may possess skills: information architecture, interaction design, visual design, and usability engineering.  These UX skills are, of course, in addition to the generic professional skills that any senior IT professional should have — for example, good communication and project-management skills.\r\n\r\n In my work coaching and mentoring senior UX designers in major corporations, I often ask them to rank themselves on a scale of 1–10 in each of these areas, so they can define their UX profile.  I explain that a 10 in usability engineering means, for example, that you have published 20 plus papers on usability studies in major international journals such as the Journal of usability Studies (JUS).  A 10 in visual design would mean that you’ve led the visual design work on something as great as the iPad user interface.  A 10 in information architecture might mean that you’ve led navigation schema design at eBay.  A 10 in interaction design might mean that a wizard you’ve designed gets users through the entire UK online tax return process successfully more than 90% of the time!  A 6 in any of these areas means that you are qualified to undertake these roles in a major commercial context.\r\n\r\n Maybe you can take some time to define your UXD profile?!\r\n\r\n Credits\r\n\r\n Many thanks to Melisa Cooper for the original inspiration to write this article, to Dr. David Travis of Userfocus for his feedback on the initial drafts, and to Pabini Gabriel-Petit for her help editing this article."

        "text":"All Praise and Thanks is for Allah subhanahu wa ta`ala (exalted is He) who has blessed us with witnessing yet another Ramadan!  The Prophet ﷺ (peace be upon him) said that actions are judged by their ending [Bukhari].  So while many of us have started preparing for Eid, we should also make sure that we end this blessed month in a great way.\r\n Tawbah: Repentance\r\n We end this month by returning to Allah (swt) in a state of humility and repentance.  We seek forgiveness of Allah (swt) and repent to Him because we acknowledge that our deeds are deficient, and we acknowledge that we have wronged ourselves and others.\r\n Repenting to Allah (swt) is a reminder that Allah is the One who guided us to righteous deeds, and we do not know if He will accept them from us.  It is from the sunnah of Allah (swt) that when we end a deed, we end it with seeking forgiveness.  We seek forgiveness after finishing our prayers and after we end a gathering just as Allah (swt) told the Prophet ﷺ to seek forgiveness and to repent after the Opening of Makkah.\r\n Shukr: Gratitude\r\n We end this month in a state of gratitude to Allah (swt).  Allah (swt) says:\r\nperiod and to glorify Allah for that [to] which he has guided you;  and perhaps you will be grateful,” (Qur’an 2:185).\r\n We must thank Allah (swt) for all that He has given us during this month.  He blessed us to be among those who worshiped Him and He gave us the health and ability to fast, to pray, and to increase in our good deeds.\r\n Gratitude is a trait of the believers that is highlighted throughout the Qur’an and Sunnah (tradition of the Prophet ﷺ).  We even see that when the believers enter Paradise, they proclaim:\r\n“[…] ‘Praise to Allah, who has guided us to this;  and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.’  […]” (Qur’an 7:43).\r\n Being grateful to Allah (swt) and thanking Him reminds us to be humble, because we would not have received anything good or have had the opportunity to do any good without the Help of Allah (swt).\r\n Takbeer: Proclaiming the Greatness of Allah\r\n We end this month by declaring the Greatness of Allah (swt) for what He has guided us to.  Allah (swt) says:\r\n“[…] to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which he has guided you;  and perhaps you will be grateful,” (Qur’an 2:185).\r\n Takbeer is to declare the Greatness of Allah (swt), to exalt Him, and magnify Him.  Saying “Allahu Akbar” is the highest and best way to exalt Allah (swt).\r\n We make takbeer from the night of Eid until the Eid prayer by saying:\r\nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest\r\n La ilaaha il Allah, There is no deity worthy of worship except for Allah\r\n Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest\r\n wa Lillahil Hamd and for Allah Alone is All Praise\r\n We repeat this throughout the night and day, reminding ourselves that Allah (swt) is Greater than everything else and we declare His Praise for having guided us to finish Ramadan.\r\n Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen (rahimahu allah, may Allah have mercy on him) says: “What is more beautiful than seeing the people proclaiming the greatness of Allah (swt) and declaring His Magnificence in every area and place, filling the horizon with Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greater than everything), Alhamdulillah (Praise and thanks is for Allah Alone) and La ilaaha il Allah (There is no deity worthy of worship except for Allah), while hoping for His Mercy and fearing His Punishment!”\r\n Intention to Change\r\n We end this month with the intention to continue fasting, praying and doing good.  Ramadan is a month of change that is meant to give us a spiritual cleansing that will last us the whole year.  The virtues of fasting and praying do not end after we celebrate Eid;  rather, Eid should be the beginning of a new chapter for us to continue doing the habits we started in Ramadan.  We can continue reading the Qur’an, fasting Mondays and Thursdays, or the White Days (the 13th-15th of each lunar month), and we can pray the night prayers every night (or once a week).\r\n We’ve tasted the sweetness of standing during the night;  we’ve tasted the sweetness of raising our hands to Allah (swt) in supplication;  we’ve tasted the sweetness of breaking our fast after a long day;  we’ve tasted the sweetness of giving charity.  So how can we return to disobedience and leaving good deeds after having tasted this sweetness?\r\n Al-Hafidh ibn Rajab (ra) says: “O one who has been freed from the Fire by His Owner!  Be cautious of returning to enslavement after having been freed!  Your Protector has removed you from the Fire and you are coming closer to it?  And He has saved you from it, and you are falling into it?”\r\n Do not be a “Ramadan Muslim” by intending to return to your old habits after the Eid prayer.  Ask Allah (swt), the One who guided you to worship Him in Ramadan, to help you continue in your worship and good deeds.  Remember that Ramadan has left us but the One who created this month will never leave;  for He is Living and His reward is Everlasting."

        "text":"He gave the characteristic pause that meant he was lacking the word he wanted to use.  “Jump behind trees?”\r\n “Surprise.”\r\n He nodded.  “We surprise.  Wait.  Hunt rest.  Tell Maer.”\r\n I nodded.  Not the quick resolution we had hoped for, but the only sane option against this number of men.  When Marten came back the three of us would take our first sting at them.  I guessed with surprise on our side, Marten could mark as many as three or four with his bow before we were forced to flee.  Odds were he wouldn’t kill all of them, but any man arrowshot would be less of a threat to us in the days to come.  “Any other way?”\r\n A long pause.  “No way that is of the Lethani,” he said.\r\n Having seen enough, I carefully slid down several feet until I was out of sight.  I shivered as the rain continued to pelt down.  It felt colder than it had a couple minutes ago, and I began to worry that I’d caught Marten’s cold.  That was the last thing I needed right now.\r\n I caught sight of Marten approaching and was about to explain our plan when I saw his panicked expression.\r\n “I can’t find them!”  he hissed frantically.  “I trailed back to where they should have been.  But they weren’t there.  So either they already turned back, which they wouldn’t do, or they were too close behind us and ended up following the wrong set of tracks in this bad light.”\r\n I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the constant rain.  “Can’t you track them down?”\r\n “If I could, I would have.  But all the prints look the same in the dark.  What are we going to do?”  He clutched at my arm, I could tell by his eyes that he was on the verge of panic.  “They won’t be careful.  They’ll think we’ve scouted everything ahead of them.  What should we do?”\r\n I reached into the pocket that held Dedan’s simulacra.  “I can find them.”\r\n But before I could do anything, there was an outcry from the eastern edge of the camp.  It was followed a second later by a furious shout and a string of cursing.\r\n “Is that Dedan?”  I asked.\r\n Marten nodded.  From over the ridge came the sound of frantic movement.  The three of us moved as quickly as we dared, peering over the top.\r\n Men were swarming from the low tents like hornets from a nest.  There were at least a dozen of them now, and I saw four with strung bows.  Long sections of planking appeared from nowhere and were leaned against the posts, making crude walls about four feet high.  Within seconds the vulnerable, wide-open camp became a veritable fortress.  I counted at least sixteen men, but now whole sections of the camp were cut off from view.  The light was worse as well, as the makeshift walls blocked the fires and cast deep shadows against the night.\r\n Marten was swearing a steady stream, understandably, as his bow wasn’t nearly as useful now.  He nocked an arrow quick as winking and might have fired it just as fast if I hadn’t laid a hand on his arm.  “Wait.”\r\n He frowned, then nodded, knowing they would have half a dozen arrows for every one of his.  Tempi was suddenly useless as well.  He would be riddled with arrows long before he came close to the camp.\r\n The only bright facet was that their attention wasn’t directed toward us.  They were focused off to the east where we had heard the sentry’s cry and Dedan’s cursing.  The three of us might escape before we were discovered, but that would mean leaving Dedan and Hespe behind.\r\n This was the time when a skilled arcanist should be able to tip the scales, if not to give us an advantage, then at least to make escape possible.  But I had no fire, no link.  I was clever enough to make do without one of those, but without both I was nearly helpless.\r\n Rain began to pour down more heavily.  Thunder grumbled.  It was only a matter of time before the bandits figured out there were only two of them and rushed over the ridge to make short work of our companions.  If the three of us drew their attention we would be overrun just as quickly.\r\n There was a concert of gentle hums, and a flight of arrows leapt over the eastern ridge.  Marten stopped swearing and held his breath.  He looked at me.  “What are we going to do?”  he said urgently.  There was a questioning shout from the camp, and when no answer was forthcoming another flight of arrows hummed over the eastern ridge, finding the range of their target.\r\n “What are we going to do?”  Marten repeated.  “What if they’re hurt?”\r\n What if they’re dead?  I closed my eyes and slid down below the ridgeline, trying to gain a moment of clear thought.  My foot bumped something soft and solid.  The dead sentry.  A dark thought occurred.  I drew a deep breath and threw myself into the Heart of Stone.  Deep.  Deeper than I had ever been before.  All fear left me, all hesitation.\r\n I took hold of the body by its wrist and began to drag it up toward the lip of the ridge.  He was a heavy man, but I hardly noticed.  “Marten, may I use your dead?”  I asked absently.  The words were in a pleasant baritone, the calmest voice I had ever heard.\r\n Without waiting for an answer, I looked over the ridgeline toward the camp.  I saw one of the men behind the wall bending his bow for another shot.  I drew my long, slender knife of good Ramston steel and fixed the image of the bowman in my mind.  I set my teeth and stabbed the dead sentry in the kidney.  The knife went in slowly, as if I were stabbing heavy clay instead of flesh.\r\n A scream rose above the sound of the thunder.  The man fell, his bow flying wildly out of his hands.  Another mercenary stooped to look at his companion.  I refocused and stabbed the sentry in his other kidney, using both hands this time.  There was a second scream, shriller than the first.  More a keen than a scream, I thought in an odd separate corner of my mind.\r\n “Don’t shoot yet,” I cautioned Marten calmly, not looking away from the camp.  “They still don’t know where we are.”  I drew the knife out, refocused, and drove it coolly into the sentry’s eye.  A man stood upright behind the wooden wall, blood pouring down his face from underneath his clutching hands.  Two of his comrades rose, trying to get him back below the wooden parapet.  My knife rose and fell and one of them toppled to the ground even as his hands rose to his own bleeding face.\r\n “Holy God,” Marten choked.  “Dear holy God.”\r\n I set the knife against the sentry’s throat and surveyed the camp.  Their military efficiency was falling apart as they began to panic.  One of the wounded men continued to scream, high and piercing over the grumbling thunder.\r\n I saw one of the bowmen searching the ridgeline with hard eyes.  I drew the knife across the sentry’s throat, but nothing seemed to happen.  Then the bowman looked puzzled and raised his hand to touch his own throat.  It came away lightly smeared with blood.  His eyes grew wide and he began to shout.  Dropping his bow he ran to the other side of the low wall, then back, trying to escape but not knowing where to run.\r\n Then he regained his composure and began desperately searching the ridgeline all around the camp.  He showed no signs of falling.  I frowned, set the knife against the dead sentry’s neck again and leaned against it hard.  My arms trembled, but the knife began to move again, slowly, as if I were trying to cut a block of ice.  The bowman’s hands flew to his neck and blood poured over them.  He staggered, stumbled, and fell into one of the fires.  He thrashed wildly, scattering burning coals everywhere, adding to the confusion.\r\n I was deciding where to strike next when lightning lit the sky, showing me a clear, stark picture of the body.  The rain had mingled with the blood, and it was everywhere.  My hands were dark with it.\r\n Unwilling to maim his hands, I rolled him over onto his stomach and struggled to remove his boots.  Then I refocused myself and sawed through the thick tendons above the ankles and behind the knees.  It crippled two more men.  But the knife was moving more and more slowly, and my arms ached with the strain of it.  The corpse was an excellent link, but the only energy I had was the strength of my body.  Under these conditions, it felt more like I was cutting wood than flesh.\r\n It had been scarcely more than a minute or two since the camp had been alerted.  I spat water and took a moment’s rest for my trembling arms and exhausted mind.  I eyed the camp below, watching the confusion and panic build.\r\n A man emerged from the large tent at the base of the tree.  He was dressed differently than the others, wearing a hauberk of bright chainmail that came nearly to his knees with a coif covering his head.  He stepped into the chaos with a fearless grace, taking everything in at a glance.  He snapped orders I couldn’t hear over the sound of rain and thunder.  His men calmed, settled back into their positions, and took up their bows and swords.\r\n As I watched him stride across the encampment I was reminded of . . .  something.  He stood in plain view, not bothering to crouch behind one of the protective walls.  He gestured to his men, and something in that motion was terribly familiar. . . .\r\n “Kvothe,” Marten hissed.  I looked up to see the tracker with his bow drawn tight to his ear.  “I’ve got the shot on their boss.”\r\n “Take it.”\r\n His bow hummed and the man sprouted an arrow from his upper thigh, piercing the chain mail, the leg itself, and the armor behind it.  From the corner of my eye I saw Marten draw another arrow and put it to the string in a fluid motion, but before he could shoot it, I saw their leader bend.  Not a deep bending at the waist as if he were doubling over in pain.  He bent at the neck to look down at the arrow that had pierced his leg.\r\n After a second’s scrutiny he grasped the arrow in a fist and snapped off the fletching.  Then he reached behind himself and pulled the arrow from his leg.  I froze as he looked straight toward us and pointed to our position with the hand that held the broken arrow.  He spoke a brief word of command to his men, tossed the arrow into the fire, and stalked gracefully to the other side of the camp.\r\n “Great Tehlu overroll me with your wings,” Marten said, his hand falling away from his bowstring.  “Protect me from demons and creatures that walk in the night.”\r\n Only the fact that I was deep in the Heart of Stone kept me from a similar reaction.  I turned back to the camp in time to see a small forest of bows being bent in our direction.  I ducked my head and aimed a kick at the stupefied tracker, knocking him over as the arrows hummed past.  He tumbled over, his quiver of arrows scattering down the muddy bank.\r\n “Tempi?”  I called.\r\n “Here,” he replied from off to my left.  “Aesh.  No arrow.”\r\n More arrows sang overhead, a few of them sticking into trees.  Soon they would get the range and start arcing the arrows overhead so they fell on us from above.  A thought came to me as calmly as a bubble rising to the surface of a pond.  “Tempi, bring me this man’s bow.”\r\n “Ia.”\r\n I heard Marten muttering something, his voice low, urgent, and indistinct.  At first I thought he’d been shot, then I realized he was praying.  “Tehlu shelter me from iron and anger,” he murmured softly.  “Tehlu keep me safe from demons in the night.”\r\n Tempi pushed the bow into my hand.  I took a deep breath and broke my mind into two pieces, then three, then four.  In each piece of my mind I held the bowstring.  I forced myself to relax and broke my mind again, five.  I tried again and failed.  Tired, wet and cold, I had reached my limit.  I heard bowstrings thrum again and arrows hit the ground around us like a heavy rain.  I felt a tug on the outside of my arm near my shoulder as one of the arrows grazed me before burying itself in the dirt.  There was a stinging, then a burning pain.\r\n I pushed the pain away and set my teeth.  Five would have to be enough.  I drew my knife lightly across the back of my own arm, just enough to draw a little blood, then mouthed the proper bindings and drew the blade across the bowstring, hard.\r\n The string held for a terrifying moment, then parted.  The bow jerked in my hand, jolting my wounded arm before it flew out of my grasp.  Cries of pain and dismay came over the ridge, letting me know I’d been at least partly successful.  Hopefully all five strings had been severed, leaving us with only one or two bowmen to deal with.\r\n But as soon as the bow flung itself out of my grasp, I felt the cold leech into me.  Not just my arms, but all the way through me: stomach, chest, and throat.  I had known I couldn’t trust the strength of my arm alone to make it through five bowstrings at once.  So I had used the only fire that is always with an arcanist, the heat of my blood.  Binder’s chills would have me soon.  If I didn’t find a way to get warm, I would lapse into shock, then hypothermia, then death.\r\n I fell out of the Heart of Stone and let the pieces of my mind slide back together, reeling a bit in confusion.  Chill, wet, and dizzy, I clawed my way back to the top of the ridgeline.  The rain felt cold as sleet on my skin.\r\n I saw only one bowman.  Unfortunately, he had kept his wits about him, and as soon as my face appeared over the top of the ridge, he drew and let fly in a smooth motion.\r\n A gust of wind saved me.  His arrow struck harsh yellow sparks from a stone outcrop not two feet from my head.  Rain pelted my face and lightning spidered across the sky.  I pushed myself back down out of sight and stabbed the sentry’s body over and over in a delirious rage.\r\n Finally, I struck a buckle and the blade snapped.  Panting, I dropped the broken knife.  I came back to my senses with the sound of Marten’s forlorn praying in my ears.  My limbs felt cold as lead, heavy and awkward.\r\n Worse than that, I could feel the numb sluggishness of hypothermia creeping through me.  I realized I wasn’t shivering, and knew it was a bad sign.

        "text":"Russia, no doubt, is a country with a rich history.  There are many glorious and heroic events.  Of course there are disputable moments too.  Let’s try to mention the main stages in development of the Russian state and have a look at the brightest historical events.\r\n\r\n First the centre of Russia was a city Kiev which is now the capital of Ukraine.  That is why the state was called Kiev Russia and was founded in 862.  That year variag prince Riurik subordinating all Russian lands later was invited to rule in Novgorod.\r\n\r\n There are lots of versions why the state was called “Rus”.  Some people consider that the word “Rus” formed from the name of the river Ros where Slavonic tribes polians lived.  Other interesting version is that “Rus” comes from “rusiy” – the way they call light-haired people here.\r\n\r\n Before the formation of Kiev Russia there lived several Slavonic peoples.  Their religion was paganism.  Russia became Christian in 988.  Christianity acceptance in Russia is connected with the rule of Valdimir Sviatoslavich who had chosen it among the existing religions of that period.\r\n\r\n XI-XIII centuries are familiar as a period of feudal dissociation in Russia.  Princes not wishing to share their power with anyone preferred to get in their possession less territory but to rule it themselves.  Besides after the death of a prince his inheritance was shared among his sons.  As a consequence the state was breaking up into smaller size princedoms.\r\n\r\n Later in XIII-XVI there was the centralization of Russia.  This was complicated with Mongol-Tatar invasion.  Mongol khans controlled the business of princes.  Moreover khans stimulated conflicts between princes so that no to let their integration and strengthening.  But in the end Russia managed to integrate.  And now the centre of the Russian state became Moscow mostly due to smart politics of Ivan Katila and other Moscow princes.\r\n\r\n In 1480 Russia managed to finally free from Mongol-Tatar Yoke which had lasted for 240 years.\r\n\r\n Ivan IV the Awesome (Ivan the Terrible) was a bright ruler.  This tsar stood out by his cruelty and love of power.  Once he killed his older son in anger.  In the country history he also left a step.  Ivan the Awesome divided the population on oprichnics and zemskiys.  Oprichnics were officially considered the defenders of the country and tsar power.  They were allowed to do practically everything.  They got land and people to use, robbed, destroyed, and killed.  Zemskiys had to suffer all that on them.  After the reign of Ivan the Awesome who didn’t leave worthy successors there comes the Vague time in Russia.  The fight for power is characteristic for that period and at the end of it the dynasty of the Romanovs replaced the dynasty of the Rurikoviches.\r\n\r\n Big contribution to Russian development was made by Peter I the Great.  Peter I became the founder of the country’s navy.  The emperor lived some time in Holland where nobody knew about his origin.  So under the look of ordinary worker he learnt to build ships.  In Russia they say that Peter I had cut through the window to Europe.  Before his reign Russia really was in isolation from other European Countries.  Peter the Great made all that was possible to shorten the existing distance.  Big attention he paid to behavior manners which were in a little amount in Russia.  Besides he made all men serving at court shave beards.  Also his merit is building the wonderful Saint-Petersburg and many other cities.\r\n\r\n The important turn of Russian history became Revolutions of XX century, the capture of power and going to socialism.  No doubt the time of socialism is one of the most famous periods.  It still challenges lots of discussions among historians.  All took place here - cruelty, fight for power, liquidation of worthy and smart people in a fear to loose it, deficits and also great victories, scientific discoveries, the coming of a quieter and safer life.\r\n\r\n Russian history contains lots of heroic victories.  On of them was the victory over Napoleon Bonaparte in 1812.  This was which is called the Fatherland one first consisted of permanent defeats for Russian soldiers.  The decision to leave Moscow was made.  Fortunately Russian armies beat the French and took back their territories.  And the end of the war notably raised the authority of Russia among European countries.\r\n\r\n Russia was a participant of the First and the Second World Wars.  The ending of these wars caused alot of suffering.  They don’t remember so often about the results of World War I, it has become a rigorous part of the past.  But the results of the Great Fatherland War – the period of Russian participation in it is still discussed.  There are some people left who took part in the battles.  Lots of stories about the front heroes have been kept.\r\n\r\n Socialism had a great influence on present condition of Russia.  We can see its rests in economics, politics, art, attitude to religion and other spheres of society life.   The entire world knows the names of Soviet Union leaders like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, and Leonid Brezhnev.  Each of them carried his contribution to Russian history.\r\n\r\n There was the Reorganization in Russia by Mikhail Gorbachev from 1985 till 1991.  Its results also reflected strongly on the present condition of Russia.\r\n\r\n Today some stability seems to have come to Russia.  People are tired of the radical turns that Russian history is filled with.  Though Russia is an unpredictable country.  So what will be later?  We’ll see."
