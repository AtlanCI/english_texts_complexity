        "text":" Following a huge 'Yes' vote, the Scotland Act 1998 was passed and the devolved parliament was elected and took powers in May, 1999.  Following the Scottish elections in 2007, a minority SNP government took power, under the leadership of First Minister, Alex Salmond that is determined to move Scotland towards independence.  The response of the main unionist parties has been to propose a constitutional commission to look at transferring more powers to the Scottish Parliament.\r\n\r\n Demands for constitutional change in Wales also led to a 1997 referendum on a proposed Assembly, though the result in this case was a very narrow 'Yes' vote.  Despite this start, discussions are now taking place about adding to the powers of the Welsh Assembly.\r\n\r\n With the Northern Ireland Assembly restored in 2007, England is now the only one of the four constituent countries of the UK that does not have its own devolved administration.  This situation has given rise to a constitutional anomaly known as The West Lothian question, in that since laws for England are made by the entire UK parliament, and the government of England is the entire UK government, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs help make law that affect England alone, though English MPs have no similar power over legislation that affects Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  This has led to demands for an English Parliament, or even for the formal ending of the United Kingdom, with independence for the constituent countries of the UK."

        "text":"by James Clear\r\n\r\n When you have a goal  —  whether it’s starting a business or eating healthier or traveling the world  —  it’s easy to look at someone who is already doing it and then try to reverse engineer their strategy.\r\n\r\n In some cases, this is really useful.  Learning from the experiences of successful people is a great way to accelerate your own learning curve.\r\n\r\n But it’s equally important to remember that the systems, habits, and strategies that successful people are using today are probably not the same ones they were using when they began their journey.\r\n\r\n What is optimal for them right now isn’t necessarily needed for you to get started.  There is a difference between the two.\r\n\r\n Let me explain.\r\n\r\n What is Optimal vs.  What is Needed\r\n\r\n If you set your bar at “amazing,” it’s awfully difficult to start.\r\n — Seth Godin\r\n\r\n Learning from others is great and I do it all the time myself.\r\n\r\n But comparing your current situation to someone who is already successful can often make you feel like you lack the required resources to get started at all.  If you look at their optimal setup, it can be really easy to convince yourself that you need to buy new things or learn new skills or meet new people before you can even take the first step toward your goals.\r\n\r\n And usually, that’s not true.  Here are some examples.\r\n\r\n Traveling the world.  Every time I travel, I see so many backpackers who have spent a fortune on gear: rainproof bags, moisture-wicking clothes, special shoes.  Now I’m not saying gear is useless.  Great gear can make your life much easier on the road, but it’s not required.  You don’t need new shoes to start running.  You don’t need new cooking bowls to start eating healthy.  And you don’t need a new backpack to start traveling.  Those things might be optimal, but they are not needed in the beginning.\r\n\r\n Starting a business.  When you’re an entrepreneur, it’s so easy to get obsessed with optimal.  This is especially true at the start.  I can remember being convinced that my first website would not succeed without a great logo.  After all, every popular website I looked at had a professional logo.  I’ve since learned my lesson.  Now my “logo” is just my name and this is the most popular website I’ve built.\r\n\r\n Eating healthy.  Maybe the optimal diet would involve buying beef that is only grass-fed or vegetables that are only organic or some other super-healthy food strategy.  But if you’re just trying to make strides in the right direction, why get bogged down in the details?  Start small and simply buy another vegetable this week  —  whether it’s organic or not.  There will be plenty of time for optimization later.\r\n\r\n Avoiding by Optimizing\r\n\r\n Claiming that you need to “learn more” or “get all of your ducks in a row” can often be a crutch that prevents you from moving forward on the stuff that actually matters.\r\n\r\n You can complain that your golf game is suffering because you need new clubs, but the truth is you probably just need two years of practice.\r\n You can argue that it’s hard to travel light without the right backpack, but the truth is you could make it work with what you have now.\r\n You can point out how your business mentor is successful because they use XYZ software, but they probably got started without it.\r\n Obsessing about the ultimate strategy or the ultimate diet or the ultimate golf club can be a clever way to prevent yourself from doing hard work.\r\n\r\n As regular readers know, I’m all for optimizing and improvement.

The Obama administration has stated that it regards Yanukovych as no longer actively leading the country.  Photograph: Sergei Chuzavkov/AP\r\n The Obama administration has signalled it no longer recognises Viktor Yanukovych as Ukraine’s president as western support firms up for the new leadership in Kiev.\r\n Jay Carney, the main White House spokesman, said that although Yanukovych “was a democratically elected leader, his actions have undermined his legitimacy and he is not actively leading the country at present”.\r\n\r\n Jen Psaki, a state department spokeswoman, said: “Yanukovych left Kiev.  He took his furniture, packed his bags, and we don’t have more information on his whereabouts.  So there are officials who have stepped in and are acting in response to that leadership gap at the moment.”\r\n\r\n Yanukovych’s whereabouts were unknown after he fled the capital Kiev in the wake of deadly protests seeking his ouster.\r\n\r\n At the same time, the US administration appealed for Russia to support a peaceful transition and not consider itself shut out of Ukraine’s future.  Psaki said the emergence of a new government in Kiev was not “a zero-sum game for Russia or any other country”.\r\n\r\n “It’s in all of our interests to support a prosperous future for the country,” said Psaki, urging Congress to quickly approve US aid to Ukraine.\r\n\r\n Yanukovych was widely seen as a puppet of Moscow by Ukraine protesters who demanded stronger ties with the European Union to boost the faltering economy of the onetime Soviet republic. \r\n US officials have said the International Monetary Fund is considering an aid package as high as $15bn to help stabilise a new, transitional government in Kiev.  Carney said the US would provide additional aid to complement the IMF, aimed at fostering Ukrainian economic stability, but it was not immediately clear how much money it would provide.  Officials later said any US assistance would seek to help Ukraine implement political reforms, in part through investing more in health and education.\r\n\r\n Senior US officials including the deputy secretary of state William Burns and the treasury secretary Jack Lew are scheduled to meet with political, business and civil society leaders in Kiev over the next two days, joining top European Union officials in the capital.\r\n The protests in Kiev were sparked by Yanukovych’s shelving of an agreement with the EU in November and turning instead for a $15bn bailout loan from Russia.  Within weeks the protests expanded amid outrage over corruption and human rights abuses, leading to calls for Yanukovych’s resignation.  Anger boiled over last week after 82 people, primarily demonstrators, were killed in clashes with security forces in the bloodiest violence in Ukraine’s post-Soviet history.\r\n\r\n The Republican senator and former US presidential candidate John McCain said: “Now more than ever, the Ukrainian people need the continued support of their friends.  The path of reform will be difficult but if the new Ukrainian government is prepared to make these tough and, at times, unpopular decisions, it will need significant assistance from the IMF and the European Union.  The United States must be ready to provide additional assistance as well.”\r\n\r\n Aides said the US vice-president, Joe Biden, spoke on Monday with the Georgian prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, in his first of several discussions about regional security, including with leaders of other former Soviet republics which are also struggling, either politically or economically, against generations of inherent Russian influence.\r\n\r\n The Associated Press contributed to this report"

        "text":" Wouldn’t plenty of people in his position be willing to engage a psychic, a medium, a spiritualist, a paranormal expert-whatever the hell this fraud wanted to call herself-even if they believed there was only a one-in-a-million chance, at best, that she really knew anything?  Isn’t that what someone who truly loved his wife would do?\r\n Or maybe this woman wasn’t trying to con him.  Maybe she really did have visions.  Maybe she truly believed she had some kind of connection to people in trouble, and was here out of a sincere wish to help him.  But maybe what she had wasn’t a gift.  Maybe she was a nut.  Deluded.  Her visions were nothing more than the product of a twisted, disordered mind.  Hallucinations.\r\n And then, of course, there was a third possibility: She was the real thing.\r\n Wendell considered that prospect highly unlikely.  But what if, somehow, for reasons he was not yet privy to, she was onto something?  Did he want her talking to the police?\r\n Not really.\r\n The smartest course, for now, seemed to be to hear her out.  See what she had to say.\r\n Once Keisha was back in the chair, with Wendell sitting across from her, he said, “First of all, let me apologize if I was at all rude before.”\r\n “Not at all.  I understand that what I do, the talent I have, is difficult for many people to get their heads around.”\r\n “Yes, well, I have to admit, I have my doubts.  But then again, I very much want to know what’s happened to Ellie.  To find out where she is.  I want her to come home.  And I suppose it doesn’t make sense to discount what you have to say until I’ve had a chance to hear it.”\r\n Keisha smiled, nodded.  “I think that’s very wise of you.”\r\n “So, if you want to tell me your vision, then what the hell, let’s hear it.”\r\n “I truly appreciate your open-mindedness about this.  I would have felt terrible, not being able to help you in your time of need.”\r\n “Okay, then.  Go ahead.”\r\n “There is one other matter to deal with first.”\r\n Here we go, he thought.\r\n “This gift that I have is also my livelihood,” Keisha explained.  “I’m sure, if you were to hire a private detective to assist you in locating your wife, you wouldn’t expect him to put in his time and use his experience without compensation.”\r\n “Of course not.”\r\n “I’m pleased to hear you say that.”\r\n “And what sort of money are we talking here, Ms. Ceylon?”  he asked.\r\n “One thousand dollars,” she answered, not being the slightest bit shy about it.\r\n His eyebrows went up.  “You’re not serious.”\r\n “I have a rare gift,” Keisha said.  “I believe it’s worth much more, but it would be my pleasure to help you for that sum, which I think is quite reasonable.”\r\n He thought about it.  “I’m not a rich man.”\r\n “I understand,” she said.  “I took that into account when I quoted that fee.”\r\n “I see.  There’s a sliding scale?  You take a look at the house and the kind of cars in the driveway, and if you see a Beemer you jack the price up?  What the market will bear and all that?”\r\n She started to get up.  “I think I’ll just be on my way, Mr. Garfield, if that’s okay with-”\r\n “How about this,” he said.  “You give me a hint of what your vision was all about, and if it sounds credible to me, then I’ll give you five hundred dollars.  And if the information you have leads to my finding Ellie, I’ll pay you another five hundred dollars.”\r\n She considered his words for a moment, and then said, “I will tell you a bit about my vision, and if you wish to hear more, then I will tell you everything for the full amount.  One thousand dollars.”\r\n He let out a long sigh.  He could only imagine what she must be thinking.  His wife is missing, and he’s going back and forth with her like he’s buying a new Toyota.  He was worried how that might look, so he said, “All right, then, we have a deal.”\r\n “I’m very pleased,” she said.  “Not just because we’ve reached a satisfactory arrangement, but because I do very much want to be able to help you.”\r\n “Yeah yeah, fine.”\r\n “Do you have something of your wife’s that I might be able to hold?”\r\n “What for?”\r\n “It helps.”\r\n “I thought you’d already had your vision.  I don’t get why you need something of my wife’s to hold on to.”\r\n “It’s all part of the process.  Some of the fuzzier details in my vision may come into sharper focus if I’m in possession of something that belongs to the person, something that’s come into close contact with them.”\r\n “What do you need?”\r\n “An article of clothing would be best.”\r\n “Like her bathrobe or something?”\r\n Keisha nodded.  Wendell excused himself and went upstairs.  A moment later, he was coming back down with a pink robe in his hands.  It was faded and tattered from many years of wear.\r\n “Thank you,” Keisha said, placing the robe in her lap and laying both hands on it.  She ran her fingertips over the material and closed her eyes.\r\n Several seconds went by without her saying a word.  Finally, Wendell interrupted her trance state, saying, “Are you getting anything, or what?”\r\n “Just a moment.”  She opened her eyes.  “I’m feeling some… tingling.”\r\n “Tingling?”\r\n “It’s a little bit like when the hairs go up on the back of your neck.  That’s when I know I’m starting to sense something.”\r\n “What?  What are you sensing?”\r\n “Your wife, she’s…”\r\n “She’s what?”\r\n “She’s cold,” Keisha said.  “Your wife is very, very cold.”\r\n\r\n SIX\r\n\r\n Keisha\r\n While Keisha was waiting to see if he’d take the bait and give her a chance to reel him in, she was thinking about her starting point.  Cast a wide net to begin with, then narrow the focus.  Why not start with the weather?\r\n It was winter, after all.  Everybody was cold.  Wherever Ellie Garfield was, it only stood to reason she’d be feeling chilled.  Okay, maybe that wasn’t true.  The night she disappeared, Ellie could have steered her car south and headed straight to Florida.  She could have been there in a day, and by now might be working on a pretty decent tan.\r\n But the thing was, Keisha wasn’t all that concerned with where this man’s wife really was.  She just wanted to offer him some possibilities.  And in return, make her money.\r\n “What do you mean, cold?”  Garfield asked.  He seemed, for the first time, intrigued.\r\n “Just what I said.  She’s very cold.  Did she take a jacket with her when she left Thursday night?”\r\n “A jacket?  Of course she took a jacket.  She wouldn’t have left the house without a jacket.  Not this time of year.”\r\n Keisha nodded.  “I’m still picking up that she’s cold.  Not just, you know, a little bit cold.  I mean chilled to the bone.  Maybe it wasn’t a warm enough coat.  Or maybe… maybe she lost her coat?”\r\n “I don’t see how she could lose her coat.  Once you go outside, you know you need it.”  He sank back into the couch, looking annoyed.  “I don’t see where this is very helpful.”\r\n “I can come back to it,” she said.  “Maybe, as I start picking up other things, the part about her being cold will take on more meaning.”\r\n “I thought you had a vision.  Why don’t you just tell me what the vision was instead of rubbing your hands all over my wife’s robe?”\r\n “Please, Mr. Garfield, it’s not as though my vision was an episode of Seinfeld and I can just tell you what I watched.  There are flashes, images, like fleeting snapshots.  It’s a little like dumping a shoebox full of snapshots onto a table.  They’re in a jumble, no particular order.  What I’m trying to do, it’s like sorting those pictures.  Sitting here now, in your wife’s home, holding something that touched her, I can start assembling those images, like a jigsaw puzzle.”\r\n “You’re pulling a fast one here.  I think-”\r\n “Melissa.”\r\n “What?”\r\n “Melissa.  That’s your daughter’s name, correct?”\r\n “That’s no big trick.  Her name’s been in the paper.”\r\n “I’m not trying to impress you with knowing her name, Mr. Garfield.  I’m trying to tell you about the images, the flashes.”\r\n Garfield looked as though he’d been scolded.  “I’m sorry.  Go ahead.”\r\n “She’s terribly troubled, Melissa is.”\r\n “Well, of course.”\r\n “But this goes beyond what you would expect a daughter to feel when her mother goes missing.”\r\n Garfield leaned forward, placed his elbows on his knees.  Really interested.  Keisha thought maybe she’d struck some sort of nerve here.  All she was doing, really, so far, was telling Garfield things he already knew, things everyone knew.  It was winter.  He had a pregnant daughter.  It was logical she’d be upset.  In another minute or so, she’d get to the next stunningly obvious thing-the car.  But first, she wanted to feel Garfield out about his daughter’s pregnancy, which was pretty hard to miss during the TV coverage.\r\n “What do you mean, it goes beyond?”  he asked.\r\n “Something about the baby…”\r\n “What about the baby?”\r\n “Tell me about the father,” Keisha said.  Turning it around, letting him do some of the work, and getting him to feed her a few more nuggets to work with at the same time.\r\n “Lester Cody.  A useless son of a bitch.”  Wendell Garfield shook his head in anger and frustration.  “Thirty years old, no job, lives at home with his parents.  When we learned Melissa was pregnant, we were upset, but we figured, if she’d found the right guy, settling down with him, having a baby, that would help her turn her life around, give her some stability.”\r\n “And your wife and Lester… I see tension here… on the periphery at least.”\r\n “Sure,” Garfield said.  “I mean, we’d both been hoping he’d step up to the plate, but I don’t see that happening.”\r\n “Ellie… did Ellie confront him?  I’ve seen some flashes that would seem to indicate that.”\r\n Flashes, yeah.  Keisha knew that if she had a daughter who’d been knocked up by some asshole, she’d be in his face night and day to make sure he did the right thing, at least at those times when she wasn’t giving her own daughter hell for getting in this mess.  Keisha’d be all over a guy like that.\r\n It seemed reasonable to assume Eleanor Garfield might feel the same way.\r\n “She phoned him a few times,” Garfield said.  “But any time she called his house, she got his mother.”  The man frowned.  “Ellie was extremely upset about the whole situation.”\r\n Was Keisha picking up something else here?  Ellie was.  Would the cop notice them as they passed each other?  Why hadn’t she gotten these windows tinted?\r\n The police car got closer.  Two officers inside.  A woman behind the wheel, a man riding shotgun.\r\n Just look ahead, she told herself.  Like you don’t care.  Be cool.\r\n The cars met.\r\n As the police car slid past, Keisha was certain no one looked over.  She kept her eyes front.  Then, seconds later, she glanced in the rearview, expecting the patrol car’s brake lights to come on.  The car to turn around.  To come after her.  Lights flashing.\r\n Nothing happened.  The police car drove on, pulling over to the shoulder out front of the Garfield house.\r\n Keisha put on her blinker, turned left at the corner.\r\n Home free.\r\n Lesson learned.\r\n\r\n FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n Winona\r\n She’d drifted off during a National Geographic special.  Something about the rain forests.  She’d never been all that interested in the rain forests.\r\n But only a few minutes into sleep, Winona Simpson woke with a start.\r\n Her heart was pounding.  She reached under the various necklaces she always wore and put her palm between her breasts, felt the rapid beating.\r\n That was some nightmare.\r\n So real.  So frightening.\r\n No, she thought.  Not a nightmare.\r\n Something else.\r\n She’d had a vision.  That was the way they often came to her.  As she slept.\r\n Winona blinked a couple of times, trying to bring the images in her head into focus.\r\n She drew in a sharp breath.\r\n “Oh, Keisha,” she said.  “What on earth have you done?”"

There are several valuable lessons that can be gleamed from the behavioral psychology research that inform much of the gamification examples that are out there today.  The first lesson is look at what people actually do.  Remember, the basis of the behaviorist approach was not to focus on understanding people's subjective mental states but to watch their external responses to stimuli.  And where that's useful, even today, is recognizing that people don't always behave in the way that you might think.  So, behavioral economics, for example, thinks about and looks at cognitive biases when people, for example, are averse to losses.  Even though, under basic economic theory, they should be indifferent to the same probability of a gain or a loss.  When we study what people actually do, we do empirical studies.  We find that the results are quite different.  So, a behaviorist approach is helpful in correcting for the biases we have about how people are going to act.  And they can uncover certain kinds of actions that may be valuable.  So, for example at the beginning of the class, I gave you the example of the speed camera lottery which was built on the science that track how fast you're going and you might think that telling people how fast they are going, won't cause them to slow down unless they get a ticket every time they speed.  But it turns out that even without the lotteries, people will slow down when these signs are put in place.  They are now used throughout the United States.  On average, studies suggest people slow down about ten%just with the signs.  This more gamified example that I gave you with the lottery aspect to it caused to slow down of roughly twenty percent in Sweden when it was tried.  But even without that, there are results based on what people do in reaction to those signs.  So, we shouldn't ignore that just because it seems like there's no direct punishment for speeding past the sign.  If, in fact, people slow down, then that's something useful, and we can employ that.  That's a behaviorist kind of insight.  The second and related insight is to focus on feedback.  The traffic sign about how fast you're going is a kind of feedback and as I've talked about a number of times, feedback is essential to the vast majority of video games.  When you do something, you get points.  You see an immediate reaction to your activity and that tells you what you're doing.  You don't have to wait all the way to the end of the process to know how well you're doing.  In feedback, we also see in gamification.  So, this was, if you recall the progress bar example from LinkedIn.  And part of what makes this effective in making people fill out the profile more, is that it gives you feedback.  It says, guess what, you are 90 percent of the way there.  You may have known that you where some of the way there, maybe you have seen somewhere how far along you were, but to actually see right in front of you, you're 90 percent of the way there.  And then to give you a small step up to say, alright, you are now here on the ladder.  You're, you're right here at this point on the step ladder but if you want to get up a little bit further, we will tell you how to get to the next step.  That's another part of feedback, and that's what you see here on this simple seeming 95 percent in the Linked in progress bar.  It says, here's how to break down the problem so that there's just a little bit more to go.  So, feedback about where you are and feedback about how to get to the next step using small quantifiable goals.  Those are processes that we see in lots of kinds of behavioral change programs, where things like weight loss and alcohol cessation and so forth.  And they're effective in many cases because they draw upon these behavioral insights.  That people respond to specific quantitative regular immediate feedback about their behavior.  The next lesson to take from behaviorism is that consequences can create results because they condition people.  This was the loop that I talked about with operant conditioning.  And to the extent that it works, it works based on people learning to associate certain results from what happens in a game or some other kind of system.  So, here's an example from Farmville, the spectacularly successful social Facebook game from Zynga.  Farmville has this concept of crops withering.  The game is about you creating your own farm and you grow different kinds of crops and build things up and so forth.  But you have to water the crops periodically.  Because if you don't, the crops look like these ones here, they wither.  And each set of crops has a specific time limit when the crops mature and they can be harvested, you wanna harvest the crops because then you can use them for other things.  But at a certain point of time, if you don't harvest them and don't water them enough, they turn into these brown withered things that you see here.  And what Farmville was able to do based on this structure, was create what was called an appointment mechanic.  And the idea is that people know that they have to come back at a certain time interval to water their crops or to harvest them.  Because if not, they're going to wither.  And that creates this draw, people start to realize, well, I better check in ever day or maybe every hour, to make sure that my crops aren't withering, to make sure that I kept things up to date.  Because, if I don't, then I'm going to lose out.  And this draw of having to constantly check in and tend to your virtual farm was part of what made Farmville so powerful and successful because it got people learning to just as a matter of habit, regularly check back in.  That's a very behavioral kind of approach which worked well for Farmville.  And it also underlies many of the PBL type examples of gamification.  So, early on, I gave you the example of the MLB.com badges that you would collect when you watch streaming video of the games based on certain things that happen.  And I gave you the quotes from that blog, where people were saying, gee, what is it that's so addictive about this?  Why are we obsessed with c ollecting these badges?  And the reason is a behavioral kind of feedback loop.  That, people see that when they take the action, they get the badge and that feels rewarding to them for reasons that I will talk about and they learn through that operant conditioning process that if they keep doing that, keep watching the videos, they'll get more badges.  And there's a kind of addictive quality to it that gets people, at least some people to want to come back more and more.  So, that's a behavioral kind of structure in a gamification example.  Now just to preview what's coming later, don't take away from this that all gamification works this way or that all gamification should work this way.  There's some real problems and limitations to this notion that gamification is like addiction and it's about creating these behavioral loops.  But it's worth noting that this is something that does work in some cases, and understanding where it comes from.  Now, basically, the idea here is about rewards.  So, behaviorism talks about conditioning.  But specifically, this example with the badges is about rewarding people.  It's about giving them some benefit.  Something that seems valuable, even though it's not tangible or not worth any money.  And reinforcing by continually providing those rewards.  Much of the PBL type gamification that's out there is very focused on the notion of rewards.  And one reason I gave you the whole pyramid of elements before, was to emphasize that rewards are valuable, but they're just one of the kinds of game mechanics that are out there.  Here, they are here and you see all these other kinds of mechanics that are not specifically about rewards.  So, rewards are real, but they should only be one piece in the toolbox.  That being said, when we go down a level to the components, to the more surface level aspects of gamification, at least the ones that are regular patterns in many of the examples today, you'll see that a great many of them tie in at least in some way to rewards.  So, achievem ents, badges, boss fights, collections, content unlocking.  Leaderboards, levels, points, quests and virtual goods.  All can or necessarily, link into the idea of running some kinds of rewards.  So rewards are very powerful and very significant in gamification.  But keep in the back of your head that they should not be the only thing that you think about.  Now, why are these rewards so powerful?  Why do people talk about things like obsession?  Like a moth to a flame, addiction when they're referring to these silly little badges, or to something in a game that has no real or tangible value.  The reason comes back again to psychology, specifically to brain chemistry.  And it relates to something called the dopamine system.  The structure in the brain that is associated with pleasure, and interestingly also associated with learning.  And our brains release and reabsorb the neuro-transmitted dopamine in response to certain activities.  And rewards, things that we find rewarding or valuable, or sometimes just surprising, tend to cause that dopamine release.  And that gives you literally a shot of a drug.  It's literally pleasurable and that causes you to make that association of the activity and the pleasure.  It causes that learning process and causes people to literally feel a little bit like they have to go back and engage in the activity.  So you see here Samsung Nation, the PBL type gamification site that I've showed you a few times before, this is an example of one badge that you get.  And the idea here is when you unlock this badge, it says, sweet, you just unlocked a badge and this one is just by hanging out.  So, you didn't do anything, right?  You're just hanging out in the site and it says, poof, you get a badge.  All of the sudden there is something there, there is something that manifests that, that you didn't necessarily expect in return for spending time on the site and to the extent that, that works.  Again, I caution you, this doesn't always work, it doesn't work for everyone but the t hing that is working there when it does work, is that dopamine hit.  That sense of ooh, that comes about in your brain associating the reward with the activity.  And so, behavioral gamification tends to focus on creating rewards that maximize that engagement based on dopamine release.  And based on that addictive quality, that we also see in lots of social games, like Farmville and so forth. \r\n\r\n 5.4.  Reward Structures (10:30)\r\n Cognitive Evaluation Theory \r\n •  Tangible/intangible \r\n •  Expected/unexpected \r\n •  Contingency \r\n – Task non-contingent \r\n –  Engagement-contingent \r\n – Completion-contingent \r\n – Performance-contingent \r\n\r\n •  Intangible \r\n •  Unexpected \r\n •  Engagement-contingent\r\n\r\n SAPS (Zichermann) \r\n •  Status \r\n •  Access \r\n •  Power \r\n •  Stuff\r\n\r\n Gamification at least in it's more behavioral manifestations tends to be very heavily about rewards.  But there are lots of different ways to do rewards.  First of all, many different things can be rewarded.  So Four Square with its famous badges has rewards for all sorts of things.  Rewards for the first time that you check in, rewards for checking in ten, 25, 50 times.  Rewards for checking in every day, rewards for showing up at a bar a certain number of times.  Rewards for being part of a swarm or a flash mob where lots of people are checking in, in the same place and so on and so forth.  So, the first point is that creative and effective gamification designs will think pretty expansively about what can be rewarded.  What kinds of behavior does the designer want to incentivize and what are different options.  Again, the goal is to give users, a.k.a.  Players, a set of meaningful choices and a set of options that make the game feel more engaging.  The second aspect of rewards is that there are different categories of rewards.  And one typology of different kinds of rewards, not at all limited to gamification, is what's called Cognitive Evaluation Theory.  And this comes from Richard Ryan and Ed Deci who we're going to meet in the next segment when we start to talk about self determination theory.  But one of the things that they developed was a typology of different kinds of rewards that can be used to motivate behavior.  So the first category, the first distinction that they highlight is between tangible rewards and intangible rewards.  Physical things versus things that are not real in any physical, tangible sense.  So a badge is an intangible reward.  It's not something you can take with you.  It's not something you can hold in your hands.  On the other hand, money is a tangible reward.  But not all tangible rewards are money.  A Boy Scout badge, the sown on patch that goes on a Boy Scout uniform, tangible reward.  Lots and lots of kinds of rewards may not be directly for money value.  They may be of sentimental value or a sta tus value or something to the person that receives them.  That's still a tangible reward if what they get is some physical thing.  If what they get is, Good Job, that's a verbal reward, that's intangible, and if they get something digital, that's also an intangible reward.  Second set of distinction for rewards, is between expected rewards and unexpected rewards.  Sometimes, we know the reward is coming, if we do certain things.  Sometimes the reward just happens.  It's a surprise.  And our brains love surprises.  We're going to talk about this more but we are hardwired to seek out surprises, to find them interesting that dopamine, pleasure system of the brain loves surprises.  So, that means that an expected reward isn't, quite so cool to the brain.  But, most of the rewards that we tend to think about specially in areas like gamification where the idea is designing for certain behaviors, tend to be expected.  They say, if you visit the site a certain number of times and if you make x number of blog posts you will get this reward.  And so you as the player see that, and to the extent that the reward motivates you you're responding to the expectation of getting the reward.  So, distinction between those kinds of rewards and ones that just come up by surprise.  Even though they may be on some defined schedule or algorithm by the designer, but to the player they are not expected.  Third, set of distinctions has to do with what the rewards are contingent on.  What is it that the player or other participant has to do to get their reward?  And here there are several different kinds of subcategories.  The first subcategory is if the reward is non-contingent, i.e., you get the reward no matter what.  You don't have to do anything, you just get the reward.  That's the reward not being contingent upon a task.  Not something that we see too commonly in gamification and not something that we see too commonly in general because then, what's the point if you get the reward automatically?  Second category is if the reward is contingent upon en gagement.  And engagement here means starting the task.  So, if we want someone to paint our house, we will give them the reward when they start painting the house.  Or if we want someone to do something on our website or check out our product reviews, just starting it is what gives them the reward, whether it's a badge or some amount of points, or even some money.  Third category is completion consistent, contingent.  So, here it's not just starting it, it's actually finishing it.  You'll have to go all the way through and finish the task in order to get the reward.  Remember the mlb.com badges that popped up when you watched videos and certain things happened, those were completion contingent.  Remember that one of the people who was talking about them on the blog site complained that his coworker shut down the computer, and therefore he didn't get the rewards because the rewards system was designed that you had to watch the entire video of the game in order to be eligible for the badge.  So that's an example of being completion consistent, contingent instead of engagement contingent.  And finally, performance contingent.  Both of these two, the engagement and the completion one, require someone to do a task. "

The show is going on now — the animals are doing beautifully,\" said Ben.\r\n\r\n The Captain muttered an oath.  Phil suddenly grasped him by the throat, hurled him against the wall, and snatched the keys from his hand.\r\n\r\n Page 225\r\n \"Now open your mouth, you white-livered cur, and inside of twenty-four hours I'll have you behind the bars.

Accompany us to the street and strike your charges from the record.\"\r\n\r\n The coward did as he was ordered, and Ben hurried back to Piedmont with a friend toward whom he began to feel closer than a brother.\r\n\r\n When Elsie heard the full story of the outrage, she bore herself toward Ben with unusual tenderness, and yet he knew that the event had driven their lives farther apart.  He felt instinctively the cold silent eye of her father, and his pride stiffened under it.  The girl had never considered the possibility of a marriage without her father's blessing.  Ben Cameron was too proud to ask it.  He began to fear that the differences between her father and his people reached to the deepest sources of life.\r\n\r\n Phil found himself a hero at the Cameron House.  Margaret said little, but her bearing spoke in deeper language than words.  He felt it would be mean to take advantage of her gratitude.\r\n\r\n But he was quick to respond to the motherly tenderness of Mrs. Cameron.  In the groups of neighbours who gathered in the evenings to discuss with the doctor the hopes, fears, and sorrows of the people, Phil was a charmed listener to the most brilliant conversations he had ever heard.  It seemed the normal expression of their lives.  He had never before seen people come together to talk to one another after this fashion.  More and more the\r\n\r\n Page 226\r\n simplicity, dignity, patience, courtesy, and sympathy of these people in their bearing toward one another impressed him.  More and more he grew to like them.\r\n\r\n Marion went out of her way to express her open admiration for Phil and tease him about Margaret.  The Rev. Hugh McAlpin was monopolizing her on the Wednesday following his return from Columbia and Phil sought Marion for sympathy.\r\n\r\n \"What will you give me if I tease you about Margaret right before her?\"  she asked.\r\n\r\n He blushed furiously.\r\n\r\n \"Don't you dare such a thing on peril of your life!\"\r\n\r\n \"You know you like to be teased about her,\" she cried, her blue eyes dancing with fun.\r\n\r\n \"With such a pretty little friend to do the teasing all by ourselves, perhaps — \"\r\n\r\n \"You'll never get her unless you have more spunk.\"\r\n\r\n \"Then I'll find consolation with you.\"\r\n\r\n \"No, I mean to marry young.\"\r\n\r\n \"And your ideal of life?\"\r\n\r\n \"To fill the world with flowers, laughter, and music —  especially my own home — and never do a thing I can make my husband do for me!  How do you like it?\"\r\n\r\n \"I think it very sweet,\" Phil answered soberly.\r\n\r\n At noon on the following Friday, the Piedmont Eagle appeared with an editorial signed by Dr. Cameron, denouncing in the fine language of the old school the arrest of Ben as \"despotism and the usurpation of authority.\"\r\n\r\n At three o'clock, Captain Gilbert, in command of the troops stationed in the village, marched a squad of soldiers\r\n\r\n Page 227\r\n to the newspaper office.  One of them carried a sledgehammer.  In ten minutes he demolished the office, heaped the type and their splintered cases on top of the battered press in the middle of the street, and set fire to the pile.\r\n\r\n On the court-house door he nailed this proclamation:\r\n\r\n    \"To the People of Ulster County:\r\n\r\n    \"The censures of the press, directed against the servants of the people, may be endured;  but the military force in command of this district are not the servants of the people of South Carolina.  WE ARE YOUR MASTERS.  The impertinence of newspaper comment on the military will not be brooked UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER.\r\n\r\n \"G. C. GILBERT, \"Captain in Command.\"\r\n\r\n Not content with this display of power, he determined to make an example of Dr. Cameron, as the leader of public opinion in the county.\r\n\r\n He ordered a squad of his negro troops to arrest him immediately and take him to Columbia for obstructing the execution of the Reconstruction Acts.  He placed the squad under command of Gus, whom he promoted to be a corporal, with instructions to wait until the doctor was inside his house, boldly enter it and arrest him.\r\n\r\n When Gus marched his black janizaries into the house, no one was in the office.  Margaret had gone for a ride with Phil, and Ben had strolled with Elsie to Lover's Leap, unconscious of the excitement in town.\r\n\r\n Dr. Cameron himself had heard nothing of it, having just reached home from a visit to a country patient.\r\n\r\n Gus stationed his men at each door, and with another\r\n\r\n Page 228\r\n trooper walked straight into Mrs.  Cameron's bedroom, where the doctor was resting on a lounge.\r\n\r\n Had an imp of perdition suddenly sprung through the floor, the master of the house of Cameron would not have been more enraged or surprised.\r\n\r\n A sudden leap, as the spring of a panther, and he stood before his former slave, his slender frame erect, his face a livid spot in its snow-white hair, his brilliant eyes flashing with fury.\r\n\r\n Gus suddenly lost control of his knees.\r\n\r\n His old master transfixed him with his eyes, and in a voice, whose tones gripped him by the throat, said:\r\n\r\n    \"How dare you?\"\r\n\r\n The gun fell from the negro's hand, and he dropped to the floor on his face.\r\n\r\n His companion uttered a yell and sprang through the door, rallying the men as he went:\r\n\r\n    \"Fall back!  Fall back!  He's killed Gus!  Shot him dead wid his eye.  He's conjured him!  Git de whole army quick.\"\r\n\r\n They fled to the Commandant.\r\n\r\n Gilbert ordered the negroes to their tents and led his whole company of white regulars to the hotel, arrested Dr. Cameron, and rescued his fainting trooper, who had been revived and placed under a tree on the lawn.\r\n\r\n The little Captain had a wicked look on his face.  He refused to allow the doctor a moment's delay to leave instructions for his wife, who had gone to visit a neighbour.  He was placed in the guard-house, and a detail of twenty soldiers stationed around it.\r\n\r\n Page 229\r\n The arrest was made so quickly, not a dozen people in town had heard of it.  As fast as it was known, people poured into the house, one by one, to express their sympathy.  But a greater surprise awaited them.\r\n\r\n Within thirty minutes after he had been placed in prison, a Lieutenant entered, accompanied by a soldier and a negro blacksmith who carried in his hand two big chains with shackles on each end.\r\n\r\n The doctor gazed at the intruders a moment with incredulity, and then, as the enormity of the outrage dawned on him, he flushed and drew himself erect, his face livid and rigid.\r\n\r\n He clutched his throat with his slender fingers, slowly recovered himself, glanced at the shackles in the black hands and then at the young Lieutenant's face, and said slowly, with heaving breast:\r\n\r\n    \"My God!  Have you been sent to place these irons on me?\"\r\n\r\n \"Such are my orders, sir,\" replied the officer, motioning to the negro smith to approach.  He stepped forward, unlocked the padlock and prepared the fetters to be placed on his arms and legs.  These fetters were of enormous weight, made of iron rods three-quarters of an inch thick and connected together by chains of like weight.\r\n\r\n \"This is monstrous!\"  groaned the doctor, with choking agony, glancing helplessly about the bare cell for some weapon with which to defend himself.\r\n\r\n Suddenly, looking the Lieutenant in the face, he said: \"I demand, sir, to see your commanding officer.  He\r\n\r\n Page 230\r\n cannot pretend that these shackles are needed to hold a weak unarmed man in prison, guarded by two hundred soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n \"It is useless.  I have his orders direct.\"\r\n\r\n \"But I must see him.  No such outrage has ever been recorded in the history of the American people.  I appeal to the Magna Charta rights of every man who speaks the English tongue — no man shall be arrested or imprisoned or deprived of his own household, or of his liberties, unless by the legal judgment of his peers or by the law of the land!\"\r\n\r\n \"The bayonet is your only law.  My orders admit of no delay.  For your own sake, I advise you to submit.  As a soldier, Dr. Cameron, you know I must execute orders.\"\r\n\r\n \"These are not the orders of a soldier!\"  shouted the prisoner, enraged beyond all control.  \"They are orders for a jailer, a hangman, a scullion — no soldier who wears the sword of a civilised nation can take such orders.  The war is over;  the South is conquered;  I have no country save America.  For the honour of the flag, for which I once poured out my blood on the heights of Buena Vista, I protest against this shame!\"\r\n\r\n The Lieutenant fell back a moment before the burst of his anger.\r\n\r\n \"Kill me!  Kill me!\"  he went on, passionately throwing his arms wide open and exposing his breast.  \"Kill- I am in your power.  I have no desire to live under such conditions.  Kill, but you must not inflict on me and on my people this insult worse than death!\"\r\n\r\n Page 231\r\n \"Do your duty, blacksmith,\" said the officer, turning his back and walking toward the door.\r\n\r\n The negro advanced with the chains cautiously, and attempted to snap one of the shackles on the doctor's right arm.\r\n\r\n With sudden maniac frenzy, Dr. Cameron seized the negro by the throat, hurled him to the floor, and backed against the wall.\r\n\r\n The Lieutenant approached and remonstrated:\r\n\r\n    \"Why compel me to add the indignity of personal violence?  You must submit.\"\r\n\r\n \"I am your prisoner,\" fiercely retorted the doctor.  \"I have been a soldier in the armies of America, and I know how to die.  Kill me, and my last breath will be a blessing.  But while I have life to resist, for myself and for my people, this thing shall not be done!\"\r\n\r\n The Lieutenant called a sergeant and a file of soldiers, and the sergeant stepped forward to seize the prisoner.\r\n\r\n Dr. Cameron sprang on him with the ferocity of a tiger, seized his musket, and attempted to wrench it from his grasp.\r\n\r\n The men closed in on him.  A short passionate fight, and the slender, proud, gray-haired man lay panting on the floor.\r\n\r\n Four powerful assailants held his hands and feet, and the negro smith, with a grin, secured the rivet on the right ankle and turned the key in the padlock on the left.\r\n\r\n As he drove the rivet into the shackle on his left arm, a spurt of bruised blood from the old Mexican War wound stained the iron.\r\n\r\n Page 232\r\n Dr. Cameron lay for a moment in a stupor.  At length he slowly rose.  The clank of the heavy chains seemed to choke him with horror.  He sank on the floor, covering his face with his hands and groaned:\r\n\r\n    \"The shame!  The shame!  O God, that I might have died!  My poor, poor wife!\"\r\n\r\n Captain Gilbert entered and said with a sneer:\r\n\r\n    \"I will take you now to see your wife and friends if you would like to call before setting out for Columbia.\"\r\n\r\n The doctor paid no attention to him.\r\n\r\n \"Will you follow me while I lead you through this town, to show them their chief has fallen, or will you force me to drag you?\"\r\n\r\n Receiving no answer, he roughly drew the doctor to his feet, held him by the arm, and led him thus in half- unconscious stupor through the principal street, followed by a drove of negroes.  He ordered a squad of troops to meet him at the depot.  Not a white man appeared on the streets.  When one saw the sight and heard the clank of those chains, there was a sudden tightening of the lip, a clinched fist, and an averted face.\r\n\r\n When they approached the hotel, Mrs. Cameron ran to meet him, her face white as death.\r\n\r\n In silence she kissed his lips, kissed each shackle on his wrists, took her handkerchief and wiped the bruised blood from the old wound on his arm the iron had opened afresh, and then with a look, beneath which the Captain shrank, she said in low tones:\r\n\r\n    \"Do your work quickly.

If he comes before you go, he will kill you on sight as he would a mad dog.\"\r\n\r\n With a sneer, the Captain passed the hotel and led the doctor, still in half-unconscious stupor, toward the depot down past his old slave-quarters.  He had given his negroes who remained faithful each a cabin and a lot.\r\n\r\n They looked on in awed silence as the Captain proclaimed:\r\n\r\n    \"Fellow citizens, you are the equal of any white man who walks the ground.  The white man's day is done.  Your turn has come.\"\r\n\r\n As he passed Jake's cabin, the doctor's faithful man stepped suddenly in front of him, looking at the Captain out of the corners of his eyes, and asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Is I yo' equal?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n \"Des lak any white man?\"\r\n\r\n \"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n The negro's fist suddenly shot into Gilbert's nose with the crack of a sledge-hammer, laying him stunned on the pavement.\r\n\r\n \"Den take dat f'um yo' equal, d—m you!\"  he cried, bending over his prostrate figure.  \"I'll show you how to treat my ole marster, you low-down slue-footed devil!\"\r\n\r\n The stirring little drama roused the doctor, and he turned to his servant with his old-time courtesy, and said:\r\n\r\n    \"Thank you, Jake.\"\r\n\r\n \"Come in here, Marse Richard;  I knock dem things off'n you in er minute, 'en I get you outen dis town in er jiffy.\"\r\n\r\n Page 234\r\n \"No, Jake, that is not my way;  bring this gentleman some water, and then my horse and buggy.  You can take me to the depot.  This officer can follow with his men. \"And he did.\r\n\r\n Page 235\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n FORTY ACRES AND A MULE\r\n\r\n WHEN Phil returned with Margaret, he drove, at Mrs. Cameron's request, to find Ben, brought him with all speed to the hotel, took him to his room, and locked the door before he told him the news.  After an hour's blind rage, he agreed to obey his father's positive orders to keep away from the Captain until his return, and to attempt no violence against the authorities.  Phil undertook to manage the case in Columbia, and spent three days in collecting his evidence before leaving.\r\n\r\n Swifter feet had anticipated him.  Two days after the arrival of Dr. Cameron at the fort in Columbia, a dust- stained, tired negro was ushered into the presence of General Howle.\r\n\r\n He looked about timidly and laughed loudly.\r\n\r\n \"Well, my man, what's the trouble?  You seem to have walked all the way, and laugh as if you were glad of it.\"\r\n\r\n \"I 'spec' I is, sah,\" said Jake, sidling up confidentially.\r\n\r\n \"Well?\"  said Howle, good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n Jake's voice dropped to a whisper.\r\n\r\n \"I hears you got my ole marster, Dr. Cameron, in dis place.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.  What do you know against him?\"\r\n\r\n Page 236\r\n \"Nuttin', sah.  I dis hurry 'long down ter take his place, so's you kin sen' him back home.  He's erbleeged ter go.  Dey's er pow'ful lot er sick folks up afar in de county can't git 'long widout him, en er pow'ful lot er well ones gwiner be raisin' de debbel 'bout dis.  You can hol' me, sah.  Des tell my ole marster when ter be yere, en he sho' come.\"\r\n\r\n Jake paused and bowed low.\r\n\r\n \"Yessah, hit's des lak I tell you.  Fuddermo', I 'spec' I'se de man what done de damages.  I 'spec' I bus' de Capt'n's nose so 'taint gwine be no mo' good to 'im.\"\r\n\r\n Howle questioned Jake as to the whole affair, asked him a hundred questions about the condition of the county, the position of Dr. Cameron, and the possible effect of his event on the temper of the people.\r\n\r\n The affair had already given him a bad hour.  The news of this shackling of one of the most prominent men in the state had spread like wildfire, and had caused the first deep growl of anger from the people.  He saw that it was a senseless piece of stupidity.  The election was rapidly approaching.  He was master of the state, and the less friction the better.  His mind was made up instantly.  He released Dr. Cameron with an apology, and returned with him and Jake for a personal inspection of the affairs of Ulster county.\r\n\r\n In a thirty-minutes' interview with Captain Gilbert, Howle gave him more pain than his broken nose.\r\n\r\n \"And why did you nail up the doors of that Presbyterian church?\"  he asked, suavely.\r\n\r\n \"Because McAlpin, the young cub who preaches there,\r\n\r\nPage 237\r\n dared come to this camp and insult me about the arrest of old Cameron.\"\r\n\r\n \"I suppose you issued an order silencing him from the ministry?\"\r\n\r\n \"I did, and told him I'd shackle him if he opened his mouth again.\"\r\n\r\n \"Good.  The throne of Russia needn't worry about a worthy successor.  Any further ecclesiastical orders?\"\r\n\r\n \"None, except the oaths I've prescribed for them before they shall preach again.\"\r\n\r\n \"Fine!  These Scotch Covenanters will feel at home with you.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"But they make no assessment about how well the task is done.  Either you start it or you finish it, and that's enough.  Performance contingent says you have to do well somehow on the task in order to get the reward.  We are rewarding you for not just what you did, but for how you did it.  So, those are a spectrum of different kinds of rewards that can be offered.  And for now, let's just bracket the question of how effective those different kinds of rewards are.  But they're different kinds of rewards, all of which can be applied in gamification.  So let's look at a few different examples and see which category they fit into.  The, first couple come from the Samsung Nation site, that I've already introduced you to.  Here's a badge that you get, it's called the Cruise Badge, that you get for ha nging out on the site.  Certain amount of time you spend on the site but basically, you show up to the site and as far as you're concerned you just are there and this badge pops up after a certain amount of time.  What kind of reward is that?  The Samsung Nation Cruise Badge is intangible, right?  Just a badge.  Most of the examples we're going to see in gamification tend to be intangible rewards, but not all as we'll get to.  It's unexpected.  It's something that just pops up when you spend a little time on the site, presumably this is something that Samsung puts in to give you a little surprise reward and get you engaged in the whole badge structure that they are trying to use to drive behavior.  And it's engagement contingent.  Now, at some level you might think this is completion contingent because it requires you to spend certain amount of time, I'm guessing it's ten minute based on the design of the badge.  But from the user's perspective, this is the badge you get just for hanging out there.  It's basically a badge that you get once you spend enough time to really be thought of as engaging and visiting the site, and not just popping on there and popping off instantaneously.  So I would consider this an engagement-contingent reward.  Something that you get unexpectedly just for starting to spend time on the site.  Here's another badge on the same Samsung Nation website.  This one is for hanging out a lot and it's basically I think for 30 minutes of time on the site but this one is a quest.  So, this one's a little different.  It's still intangible, but it's an expected reward.  You get this badge for doing something on a quest which defines a set of rules.  The quest says, if you spend 30 minutes you'll get this other badge.  The notion of course, being this other badge is cooler or there more badges than just spending ten minutes on the site.  But the fact that you know that you're going on a quest turns it into an expected award.  And it also makes it completion contingent.  Now that you know you'll have to spend 30 mi nutes to get the reward, you gotta spend 30 minutes to get the reward.  It's not just something you get for embarking on the quest.  Now, many examples of rewards in gamification and otherwise are hybrids of more than one of these categories.  Here is one example from World of Warcraft.  This is an achievement that you get for various fishing prowess in the game.  Yes, if you haven't played W.O.W., fishing is actually a skill in the game.  The reward here you get is just a title.  So, intangible reward.  Just a, something that goes in front of your character name.  And there's all these sub components.  And some of them are things like, catch a 1,000 fish.  That's completion contingent, pretty clear. "

        "text":"Your 8-month-old's development\r\n\r\n Crawling\r\n Your baby may be creeping (pushing himself around on his belly), crawling, or moving about by bottom shuffling  —  scooting around on his posterior using a hand behind him and a foot in front of him to propel himself.\r\n\r\n Creeping is your baby's first method of getting around efficiently on his own.  Usually, he'll first learn to pull himself with his hands and then get up on his hands and knees.  Then he'll figure out how to move forward and backward by pushing off with his knees.  (A \"combat crawl\" is a variation in which one leg is the pusher and the opposite arm the lead puller.)\r\n\r\n All of these variations on crawling strengthen the muscles that will soon enable him to walk.  Whichever mode of mobility your baby's using, it's fascinating to see how he solves the problem of getting around.\r\n Stand and deliver\r\n Your baby may be able to pull himself up to a standing position while holding on to furniture.  In fact, if you stand your baby next to the sofa, he may be able to hold himself up, although he may be hanging on for dear life.\r\n\r\n At this stage some parents put their children in baby walkers, but that's not a good idea.  Walkers are unsafe: Your baby can use a walker as a stepladder to reach things he couldn't normally get to, such as a hot stove or bottle of bleach.  What's more, they discourage floor play, which helps him learn to walk by giving him opportunities to crawl, pull up, and cruise while holding on to furniture  —  all activities that lead to walking.\r\n Safety first\r\n Your baby's newfound mobility means that he's now entering the land of bumps and falls.  These are an inevitable part of childhood, and although your heart may occasionally skip a beat or two, try to enjoy watching your baby explore his surroundings and discover his limits.\r\n\r\n Restraining your innate desire to protect your baby allows him to grow and learn for himself.  However, do make every effort to make your home baby-safe.  A good way to do this is to get down to his level to find the possible danger zones.  Secure fragile objects so they won't topple, for example, and keep rickety furniture in rooms that don't get much baby traffic.\r\n\r\n Now's a good time to move drapery and blind cords out of reach, pad sharp coffee-table corners, install toilet-seat locks, relocate hazardous houseplants to higher ground, lock away poisonous cleaning supplies and medications, cover electric outlets, and secure safety gates at the top and bottom of each staircase.\r\n\r\n Exploring objects\r\n Your baby's now exploring objects by shaking them, banging them, dropping them, and throwing them before falling back on the tried-and-true method of gumming them.  The idea that you do something to an object is beginning to emerge (using a comb to tidy her hair), so an activity center with lots of things your baby can bang, poke, twist, squeeze, shake, drop, and open will fascinate her.\r\n\r\n Your baby will also be fascinated with toys that have specific functions, such as phones.  If she can't hold it up to her ear herself, do it for her and pretend to have a conversation.  Over the next few months, she'll start to use objects for their intended purposes  —  brushing her hair, drinking from a cup, and babbling on her play phone.\r\n\r\n Watch for her to start pointing or looking at the correct picture when you name an object  —  especially if it's something familiar (such as eyes, nose, or mouth) or beloved (like a dog or a rubber ducky).\r\n\r\n Also, at this stage, your baby likes to see things fall down, get picked up (by you, of course), and then get thrown down again.  She's not trying to drive you mad.  She just finds the spectacle interesting and naturally wants to see it again and again.\r\n\r\n I can see clearly now\r\n Your baby's vision  —  previously about 20/40 at best  —  is now almost adult-like in its clarity and depth perception.  Though your baby's short-range sight is still best, his long-range vision is good enough to recognize people and objects across a room.  He may see a toy on the other side of the room and try to crawl toward it.  His eyes are also probably close to their final color, though you may see subtle changes later.\r\n Using his hands\r\n Your baby may start looking for dropped objects and may use his index finger to point at them.  He can easily use his fingers to rake up a piece of food and hold it with his fist closed, and he's learned to open his hand to drop and throw objects with greater precision.  He's probably beginning to master the pincer grasp, too  —  the delicate maneuver that lets him pick up small objects with his thumb and first finger.\r\n\r\n Your baby's also a fan of poking things and getting his little fingers into holes, making this a great time to cover outlets around the house.\r\n Handling your baby's fears\r\n There'll be times when your baby is afraid of things he can't understand.  Even things that didn't bother him before, like a ringing doorbell or a whistling teakettle, may frighten him.  When this happens, the most important thing you can do as a parent is comfort and reassure him.  Tell him that you're there and he's fine  —  a hug or a snuggle may be all he needs.\r\n\r\n Almost walking\r\n Your baby's getting closer and closer to full-fledged walking.  She can probably crawl up stairs and cruise, moving around upright while holding onto furniture.  A baby this age may even take a couple of steps.  (A few actually do walk now  —  and some don't walk until well into their second year.  There's a wide range of ages at which children meet this milestone.)\r\n\r\n Your baby's also learning how to bend her knees and how to sit after standing, which is harder to master than you might think!  She might get \"stuck\" standing up in her crib.  If this happens, gently show her how she can get back down.\r\n\r\n There are ways to help your baby with her walking efforts.  Stand or kneel in front of her, and help her walk toward you by holding both of her hands.  Eventually just hold your hands out to her in encouragement.  Some babies enjoy pushing a toddle truck, which provides both support and mobility.  Look for one with a wide, stable base.\r\n\r\n Babyproofing your home is a necessity now.  One good place to start is to put latches on the doors of off-limits cabinets  —  babies inevitably make a beeline for such things.  (You could also move all cleaning supplies or potential poison hazards to higher cabinets.)  Also, your baby's crib mattress should be at the lowest mattress setting.\r\n Shoes?  Not yet\r\n Once your baby starts standing and cruising, you may wonder if shoes are necessary.  Until your baby is walking around outdoors regularly, most pediatricians and developmental experts don't think so.  It's normal for your baby to walk a little bowlegged or with her feet turned out, and her feet may look flat.  Going barefoot can help strengthen your baby's arches and leg muscles, and feeling the textures of what she's walking on can help her balance."

The nightmarish slo-mo with which the mortified pedestrian reels away into streettraffic with his whole arm over his mouth, the avuncular vendor's kindly face now hateful and writhing as he hurls hygienic invectives.\r\n These ads shook viewers to the existential core, apparently.  It was partly a matter of plain old taste: ad-critics argued that the NoCoat spots were equivalent to like Preparation H filming a procto-exam, or a Depend Adult Undergarment camera panning for floor-puddles at a church social.  But Hal's paper located the level at which the Big Four's audiences reacted, here, as way closer to the soul than mere tastelessness can get.\r\n V&V's NoCoat campaign was a case-study in the eschatology of emotional appeals.  It towered, a kind of Überad, casting a shaggy shadow back across a whole century of broadcast persuasion.  It did what all ads are supposed to do: create an anxiety relievable by purchase.  It just did it way more well than wisely, given the vulnerable psyche of an increasingly hygiene-conscious U.S.A. in those times.\r\n The NoCoat campaign had three major consequences.  The first was that horrible year Hal vaguely recalls when a nation became obsessed with the state of its tongue, when people would no sooner leave home without a tongue-scraper and an emergency backup tongue-scraper than they'd fail to wash and brush and spray.  The year when the sink-and-mirror areas of public restrooms were such grim places to be.  The NoCoat co-op folks traded in their B'Gosh overalls and hand-woven ponchos for Armani and Dior, then quickly disintegrated into various eight-figure litigations.  But by this time everybody from Procter & Gamble to Tom's of Maine had its own brand's scraper out, some of them with baroque and potentially hazardous electronic extras.\r\n The second consequence was that the Big Four broadcast Networks finally just plain fell off the shelf, fiscally speaking.  Riding a crest of public disaffection not seen since the days Jif commercials had strangers shoving their shiny noses in your open jar, the Malone-Turner-and-shadowy-Albertan-led cable kabal got sponsors whose ads had been running as distant as seven or eight spots on either side of the NoCoat gaggers to jump ship to A.C.D.C.  U.S. broadcast TV's true angels of death, Malone and Turner then immediately parlayed this fresh injection of sponsorial capital into unrefusable bids for the rights to the N.C.A.A. Final Four, the MLB World Series, Wimbledon, and the Pro Bowlers Tour, at which point the Big Four suffered further defections from Schick and Gillette on one side and Miller and Bud on the other.  Fox filed for Ch.  11 protection Monday after A.C.D.C.'s coup-announcements, and the Dow turned Grizzly indeed on G.E., Paramount, Disney, etc.  Within days three out of the Big Four Networks had ceased broadcasting operations, and ABC had to fall back on old 'Happy Days' marathons of such relentless duration that bomb threats began to be received both by the Network and by poor old Henry Winkler, now hairless and sugar-addicted in La Honda CA and seriously considering giving that luridlooking but hope-provoking LipoVac procedure a try. . . .\r\n And but the ironic third consequence was that almost all the large slick advertising agencies with substantial Network billings  —  among these the Icarian Viney and Veals  —  went down, too, in the Big Four's maelstrom, taking with them countless production companies, graphic artists, account execs, computer-enhancement technicians, ruddy-tongued product-spokespersons, horn-rimmed demographers, etc.  The millions of citizens in areas for one reason or another not cable-available ran their VCRs into meltdown, got homicidally tired of 'Happy Days,' and then began to find themselves with vast maddening blocks of utterly choiceless and unenter-taining time;  and domestic-crime rates, as well as out-and-out suicides, topped out at figures that cast a serious pall over the penultimate year of the millennium.\r\n But these consequences' own consequence  —  with all the Yankee-ingenious irony that attends true resurrections  —  comes when the now-combined Big Four, muted and unseen, now, but with its remaining creditor-proof assets now supporting only those rapaciously clever executive minds that can survive the cuts down to a skeleton of a skeleton staff, rises from the dust-heap and has a collective last hurrah, ironically deploying V&V's old pro-choice/anti-passivity appeal to obliterate the A.C.D.C. that had just onths before obliterated the Big Four, bringing TCI's Malone down on a golden bell-shaped 'chute and sending TBS's Turner into self-imposed nautical exile:\r\nBecause enter one Noreen Lace-Forché, the USC-educated video-rental mogulette who in the B.S. '90s had taken Phoenix's Intermission Video chain from the middle of the Sun Belt pack to a national distribution second only to Blockbuster Entertainment in gross receipts.  The woman called by Microsoft's Gates 'The Killer-App Queen' and by Blockbuster's Huizenga 'The only woman I personally fear.’  Convincing the rapacious skeletal remains of the Big Four to consolidate its combined production, distribution, and capital resources behind a front company she'd had incorporated and idling ever since she'd first foreseen broadcast apocalypse in the Nunhagen ads' psycho-fiscal fallout  —  the front an obscure-sounding concern called InterLace TelEntertainment  —  Lace-Forché then went and persuaded ad-maestro P. Tom Veals  —  at that time mourning his remorse-tortured partner's half-gainer off the Tobin Bridge by drinking himself toward pancreatitis in a Beacon Hill brownstone  —  to regather himself and orchestrate a profound national dissatisfaction with the 'passivity' involved even in D.S.S.-based cablewatching: What matter whether your 'choices' are 4 or 104, or 504?  Veals's campaign argued.  Because here you were  —  assuming of course you were even cable-ready or dish-equipped and able to afford monthly fees that applied no matter what you 'chose' each month  —  here you were, sitting here accepting only what was pumped by distant A.C.D.C. fiat into your entertainment-ken.  Here you were consoling yourself about your dependence and passivity with rapid-fire zapping and surfing that were starting to be suspected to cause certain rather nasty types of epilepsy over the longish term.  The cable kabal's promise of 'empowerment,' the campaign argued, was still just the invitation to choose which of 504 visual spoonfeedings you'd sit there and open wide for.164164  And so but what if, their campaign's appeal basically ran, what if, instead of sitting still for choosing the least of 504 infantile evils, the vox- and digitus-populi could choose to make its home entertainment literally and essentially adult?  I.e.  what if —  according to InterLace  —  what if a viewer could more or less 100% choose what's on at any given time?  Choose and rent, over PC and modem and fiber-optic line, from tens of thousands of second-run films, documentaries, the occasional sport, old beloved non-'Happy Days' programs, wholly new programs, cultural stuff, and c., all prepared by the time-tested, newly lean Big Four's mammoth vaults and production facilities and packaged and disseminated by InterLace TelEnt.  in convenient fiber-optic pulses that fit directly on the new palm-sized 4.8-mb PC-diskettes InterLace was marketing as 'cartridges'?  Viewable right there on your trusty PC's high-resolution monitor?  Or, if you preferred and so chose, jackable into a good old premillennial wide-screen TV with at most a coaxial or two?  Self-selected programming, chargeable on any major card or on a special low-finance-charge InterLace account available to any of the 76% of U.S. households possessed of PC, phone line, and verifiable credit?  What if, Veals's spokeswoman ruminated aloud, what if the viewer could become her/his own programming director;  what if s/he could define the very entertainment-happiness it was her/his right to pursue?\r\n The rest, for Hal, is recent history.\r\n By the time not only second-run Hollywood releases but a good many first-run films, plus new sitcoms and crime-dramas and near-live sports, plus now also big-name-anchor nightly newscasts, weather, art, health, and financial-analysis cartridges were available and pulsing nicely onto cartridges everywhere, the ranks of A.C.D.C.'s own solvent program-pumpers had been winnowed back to the old-movie-andafternoon- baseball major-metro regional systems of more like the B.S. '80s.  Passive pickings were slim now.  American mass-entertainment became inherently pro-active, consumer-driven.  And because advertisements were now out of the televisual question  —  any halfway-sensitive Power-PC's CPU could edit out anything shrill or ungratifying in the post-receipt Review Function of an entertainment-diskette  —  cartridge production (meaning by now both the satellitic 'spontaneous dissemination' of viewer-selected menu-programming and the factory-recording of programming on packaged 9.6 mb diskettes available cheap and playable on any CD-ROM-equipped system) yes cartridge production  —  though tentacularly controlled by an InterLace that had patented the digital-transmission process for moving images and held more stock than any one of the five Baby Bells involved in the InterNet fiber-optic transmission-grid bought for .  17 on the dollar from GTE after Sprint went belly-up trying to launch a primitively naked early mask- and Tableauxless form of videophony  —  became almost Hobbes-ianly free-market.  No more Network reluctance to make a program too entertaining for fear its commercials would pale in comparison.  The more pleasing a given cartridge was, the more orders there were for it from viewers;  and the more orders for a given cartridge, the more InterLace kicked back to whatever production facility they'd acquired it from.  Simple.  Personal pleasure and gross revenue looked at last to lie along the same demand curve, at least as far as home entertainment went.\r\n And as InterLace's eventual outright purchase of the Networks' production talent and facilities, of two major home-computer conglomerates, of the cutting-edge Froxx 2100 CD-ROM licenses of Aapps Inc., of RCA's D.S.S. orbiters and hardware-patents, and of the digital-compatible patents to the still-needing-tocome- down-in-price-a-little technology of HDTV's visually enhanced color monitor with microprocessed circuitry and more lines of optical resolution  —  as these acquisitions allowed Noreen Lace-Forché's cartridge-dissemination network to achieve vertical integration and economies of scale, viewers' pulse-reception- and cartridge-fees went down markedly;  (165) and then the further increased revenues from consequent increases in order- and rental-volume were plowed presciently back into more fiber-optic-InterGrid-cable-laying, into outright purchase of three of the five Baby Bells InterNet'd started with, into extremely attractive rebate-offers on special new InterLace-designed R.I.S.C. (166)-grade High-Def-screen PCs with mimetic-resolution cartridge-view motherboards (recognizably renamed by Veals's boys in Recognition 'Teleputers' or 'TPs'), into fiber-only modems, and, of course, into extremely high-quality entertainments that viewers would freely desire to choose even more. (167) But there were  —  could be  —  no ads of any kind in the InterLace pulses or ROM cartridges, was the point Hal's presentation kept struggling to return to.  And so then besides e.g. a Turner who kept litigating bitterly via shortwave radio from his equatorial yacht, the true loser in the shift from A.C.D.C. cable to InterLace Grid was an American advertising industry already reeling from the death of broadcast's Big Four.  No significant markets seemed in any hurry to open up and compensate for the capping of TV's old gusher.  Agencies, reduced to skeletal cells of their best and most rapacious creative minds, cast wildly about for new pulses to finger and niches to fill.  Billboards sprouted with near-mycological fury alongside even rural two-laners.  No bus, train, trolley, or hack went unfestooned with high-gloss ads.\r\n Commercial airliners began for a while to trail those terse translucent ad-banners usually reserved for like Piper Cubs over football games and July beaches.  Magazines (already endangered by HD-video equivalents) got so full of those infuriating little fall-out ad cards that Fourth-Class postal rates ballooned, making the e-mail of their video-equivalents that much more attractive, in another vicious spiral.\r\n Chicago's once-vaunted Sickengen, Smith and Lundine went so far as to get Ford to start painting little domestic-product come-ons on their new lines' side-panels, an idea that fizzled as U.S. customers in Nike T-shirts and Marlboro caps perversely refused to invest in 'cars that sold out.'  In contrast to just about the whole rest of the industry, a certain partnerless metro-Boston ad agency was doing so well that it was more out of ennui and a sense of unlikely challenge that P. Tom Veals consented to manage PR for the fringe candidacy of a former crooner and schmaltz-mogul who went around swinging a mike and ranting about literally clean streets and creatively refocused blame and rocketing people's waste into the forgiving chill of infinite space.  (168)\r\n 30 APRIL / 1 MAY YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT\r\n Marathe did not quite sleep.  They had remained on the shelf for some hours.  He thought it a bit of much that Steeply refused even for a brief time to sit down upon the ground.  If his persona's skirt rode up above his weapon, what was the difference?  Were grotesque and humiliating undergarments also involved?\r\n Marathe's wife had been in an irreversible coma for fourteen months.  Marathe was able to refresh himself without quite sleeping.  It was not a state of fugue or neural relaxation, but a type of detachment.  He had learned this in the months after losing his legs to a U.S.A. train.  Part of Marathe floated off and hovered somewhere just above him, crossing its legs, nibbling at his consciousness as does a spectator at popcorn.\r\n At some times on the outcropping Steeply went farther than crossing his arms, almost embracing himself, chilled but unwilling to comment on the chill.  Marathe noted that the gesture of self-embrace appeared convincingly feminine and unconscious.  Steeply's preparations for his returning fieldassignment had been disciplined and effective.  The feature of complete un-swallowability about M.\r\n Steeply as a U.S.A. female journalist  —  even a massive and unfortunate-looking U.S.A. female journalist  —  was his feet.  These were broad and yellow-nailed, hairy and trollesque, the ugliest feet Marathe had observed anywhere south of 60° N, and the ugliest supposedly female feet of his experience.\r\n Both men were strangely reluctant, somehow, to broach the subject of plans for getting down off the shelf in the utter dark.  Steeply didn't even waste time wondering how Marathe could have gotten up (or down) there in the first place, short of some sort of helicopter drop, which capricious winds and the proximity of the mountainside made unlikely.  The dogma around Unspecified Services was that if Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents had one Achilles' heel it was their penchant for showing off, making a spectacle of denying any kind of physical limitation, etc.  Steeply had field-interfaced with Rémy Marathe once on a rickety-feeling Louisiana oil platform 50-plus clicks out of Caillou Bay, covered the whole time by armed Cajun sympathizers.  Marathe always disguised the boggling size of his arms under a longsleeved windbreaker.  His eyelids were half-closed whenever Steeply turned to look.  If he (Marathe) were a cat he would be purring.  One hand stayed below the blanket at all times, Steeply noted.  Steeply himself had a small and unregistered Taurus PT9 taped to his shaved inner thigh, which was the main reason he was reluctant to sit down on the outcrop-ping's stone;  the weapon was unsafetied.\r\n In the faint lume- and starlight Marathe found the four-limbed American's high-heeled feet compellingly grotesque, like loaves of soft processed U.S.A. bread being slowly squeezed and mangled by the footwear's straps.  The meaty compression of the toes at the shoes' open tips, the leather faintly creaking as he bobbed up and down, hugging himself chillily in the sleeveless summer dress, his fleshy bare arms webbed redly with mottle in the chill, one arm luridly scratched.

        "text":"You catch one fish you don't get it.  You catch 100 fish you don't get it.  You catch a 1,000 fish you get it.  But some of them are different, some of them are performance based and competitive.  So, this one here, Master Angler, you only get if you win a weekly fishing contest get the most fish or get certain special reward fish in a defined contest.  So, that one actually is not just completion contingent, it's performance contingent, and so on and so forth.  There's a mix of different rewards here that are built in and, the point I just want to make here is, there's a lot of complexity that can go into reward design.  And in designing gamification, the key is to think about the different possibilities, and come up with the rewards that are most effective in motivating users but as we'll get to in the subsequent unit, also ensuring that there is a truly meaningful and rewarding and valuable experience for those players. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 5.5.  Reward Schedules (11:19)\r\n •  Continuous \r\n •  Fixed Ratio \r\n •  Fixed Interval \r\n •  Variable\r\n\r\n Variability \r\n •  Competitive/non-competitive \r\n •  Certain/uncertain\r\n\r\n Variable Schedule Reward Machine\r\n\r\n Rewards schedules, refers to when the reward is offered as opposed to what it is or what it's based on.  And the behavioral studies suggest that the structuring of rewards schedules actually has significant implications for the psychological reaction that the rewards produce.  There are several different possible rewards schedules.  Here are some of the major ones.  The first one is the continuous reward.  So, if we look at time here on the x-axis and the activity that the player or person is engaging in, a continuous reward says guess what, you get a reward each time.  The reward is automatic.  It goes for every incidence of the action.  The second kind of reward is a fixed ratio reward.  Fixed ratio says, if let's say, that the activity happens a certain number of times.  Here I'm putting down the times that someone does something that might be visiting your website, or that might be pushing a lever in some of these behavioral studies, or it might be something involved in playing a game.  But, lets assume there is a certain level of actions.  Fixed ratio says, every n number of times you get the reward.  So, lets say the fixed ratio is every other time you get the reward, that would mean you get a reward, the first time, the third time, the fifth time, the seventh time, the ninth time and so forth.  That's a fixed ratio reward.  The third category is a fixed interval reward.  And here, the reward is fixed not based on the amount that the person engages in the activity, but based on time.  So, let's say the fixed interval says the reward comes every three units of time.  We look here.  One, two, three, that means the reward comes right here.  The reward then comes one, two, three units later.  One, two, three units after that.  One, two, three units after that.  So, you see here sometimes, as in this case right here, the reward hit right on a time when the user was engaging in the action, but some other times it didn't.  Here the reward was given right here, and the action was much earlier.  That's the point of the fixed interval a ward, it's based on time not based on what the user does, but it's still fixed in some way, it's still a regular pattern when the reward happens.  And then the final category of rewards are variable rewards.  The reward is on no fixed schedule.  And essentially, when we think about gamification, this first one here, the continuous reward is really of the least interest.  The idea that you get a reward every time, tends to not feel like a reward.  It makes sense.  At some point that's not going to motivate people when it's just something automatic.  It's not really a reward then it's just noticing that you're just playing.  The kind of fixed rewards, ratio and interval, have some psychological value, but as we'll see, the brain picks up on the pattern.  And that tends to ultimately dull the psychological impact of the reward.  Although it makes those things easier to do in gamification because those are the classic examples of badges and quests and so forth, where there's some defined set of processes or some defined set of time, as we saw in Samsung Nation, that then unlocks the reward.  The final one is probably the most interesting.  This is the variable reward.  And, as I said, our brains love surprises.  This probably comes from evolution.  Our brains are evolved basically to be hunter gatherer species.  And surprise, something that's different, unexpected out of place with the terrain, is really interesting.  And it's really interesting partly because, if you're a neolithic hunter gatherer, it might be something like a big wild animal that's going to eat you.  So, our brains are really good at picking out for example movement on a solid field.  And our brains are really good at encouraging us to take a closer look at things that are somehow different.  And something that is not according to a pattern.  Something that seems to come up randomly, fits into that category of surprise.  So, just based on the way our brains have been evolved we tend to respond powerfully to unexpected and to variable schedule, rewards.  So, then let's look at some examples of gamification rewards and how they fit on this structure.  The Samsung Nation hangout quest that I showed you, the one that was completion contingent expectant reward, is also a fixed interval reward because it's about time.  It's about a certain amount of time that has to pass before you get the reward, and so we'd call that fixed interval.  What about this one?  Here's another quest that you can go on, on Samsung Nation, and this one is based not on time but the number of visits that you make to the site.  You have to visit the site so many times to unlock this badge.  What category does that fit under?  That badge in Samsung Nation is a fixed ratio badge.  Because it happens every certain number of times that you go to the site as opposed to being based on time.  Variable rewards, as I said, are in many ways the most interesting kind of reward schedule.  But there are different ways that variable rewards can be variable.  One dimension, as I said, is just surprise.  You are not expecting them.  So therefore, they feel they are variable because you don't know if they are coming.  A second dimension is whether or not they are competitive.  So, if the reward is based on you winning some contest, you have to have the most points on the leader board, or you have to beat someone head-to-head in some kind of virtual duel in order to get the reward.  Well then it's necessarily variable, it's based on your activity, based on competition.  And there many different ways to structure competitive rewards.  Maybe you're competing in a zero sum game.  One person wins, one person looses.  Maybe you're just competing to overcome a certain threshold that other people have set.  So, there are different ways to make rewards competitive.  The second dimension that can make rewards variable is how certain the reward is.  If you know absolutely that a reward is contingent upon something, then the reward maybe variable in terms of how much that activity takes place but it's variable, it's not variable in the sense th at, you are certain once the trigger happens, the reward will follow.  But the alternate circumstance is where there's some randomness involved.  There's some level of chance, and you're not certain that you're going to get the reward even if you engage in the triggering activity.  So, once again the mlb.com badges as I talked about, those occurred not just when you watched the streaming video but when something happened to the player that was designated in that game.  So there's some randomness involved.  It's not uncertainty that if you watch the video that you're going to get the reward.  And all this ties back to the fact that again, our brains love that sense of surprise and they love those variable schedule rewards.  So the, uncertainty, turns something that would otherwise be a fairly fixed schedule.  Watch the video.  Completion contingent.  Complete the video.  Get the reward.  It turns it into more of a variable reward which is part of what makes it more interesting to people.  Now, variable rewards we see in lots of situations and probably the most powerful example of a variable reward machine is this thing.  The one armed bandit, the slot machine.  It's all about tangible rewards, those gold coins you get there.  But, what makes the slot machine work?  What makes the slot machine addictive to people is the variable reward schedule.  You never know when a reward is going to come up.  And a good slot machine, or at least an effective slot machine for the casino owner is tuned so that the reward is variable, it's random, you can't be certain exactly when it's going to happen.  But the reward comes just enough so that you don't give up.  You play, and play, and play, and most of the times you pull the big handle and nothing happens but then just before you're going to give up, you get something, you get a little jackpot.  And every once in a while someone in the casino gets a big jackpot.  So, the idea is it's a variable schedule, a random uncertain reward, but it's tuned so that it happens frequently enough so that the pe rson who's playing holds out that hope.  If I just pull the handle a few more times, put in a few more coins, then I'm going to hit the jackpot.  And that's the essence of what makes slot machines for at least some people, really addicting.  Now, I will emphasize as I have before, that this is not entirely a good thing.  Addicting people is something that is dangerous and potentially harmful to them, and while we throw around sometimes in gamification and marketing things like we want to get our customers addicted, it's important to distinguish that from truly getting them to the point where they don't know what they're doing and can't make good judgments.  And as we'll see, as we get into the next section, there's some real danger of going down this behavioral path of focusing entirely on how people respond to stimuli that we put in front of them."

        "text":"In one of my favourite books, The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, author Alain de Botton spends a chapter detailing his time spent with a career counsellor.\r\n de Botton explores the career of Robert Symons – a British man who claims he has found meaning in his job by helping others find meaning in theirs.  It’s a fascinating read because it quite simply answers the question about why people might hate their job:\r\nThey expect too much from it.\r\n It’s an interesting read (one that I recommend) but the outcome of this chapter is somewhat along the lines of “in order to be happy at work, you need to lower your expectations”.  It’s not to say you can’t be happy at work, but it does sometimes require a person to give up the romantic notion that your job should be giving you this, and that, and everything else you’ve always wanted.\r\n In fact, it sounds a lot like relationships.  So, how can you rekindle the love you once had with your job?\r\n Well, like a relationship or a marriage, it often requires you to take a step back.  Think about when the last time was that you felt happy.  When was that?  What were you doing when you were happy?  Chances are you’ll discoverthat you don’t hate your job as it is now – you’ll hate the way you’re doing it.  This is good news, because this can be fixed.\r\n I can’t remember exactly, but in de Botton’s book, Symons gets his clients to think in detail about what they hate about their jobs.  Then, they dissect the reasoning behind this hate, and often they discover they don’t actually hate it, it’s just easier to say they hate it, because they’ve believed themselves for so long.\r\n An important thing to remember when reevaluating your career choices is that what you like is not the exact opposite of what you hate.  Meaning, a job hop into something totally different is not necessarily going to be the answer to your career woes.\r\n Therefore, it’s important – once you’ve figured this out – to speak up about what you want.  Do not assume your boss or manager knows what you want, and even if you think you’ve made yourself clear, make yourself even clearer.\r\n It’s exactly the same as dealing with frictions in your romantic relationships, and it’s the reason why many of them break down.  One party think they’ve made themselves clear, and the other thinks they’ve done what they can to accommodate them, when in fact both parties have been communicating extremely poorly with one another.\r\n So, start talking!  I mean, if the alternative is to quit your job, then what’s the problem?\r\n Lastly, when figuring out how to find the love in your job again, focus on the bits you love.  Most of what we do during the working day are not things we love doing.  They are things that are necessary for our jobs to continue –meetings, emails, mundane tasks, etc – but they’re not what keeps you ticking.\r\n Make time to really do the things you love at work.  Schedule it in if you have to, or put less pressing things aside to do the tasks that affect your bigger purpose at work.  I’m not sure what will happen exactly, but surely it’s better than sitting there moaning to yourself about doing something you claim to hate.\r\n The secret to happiness, or at least contentment, with our jobs isn’t about making our jobs work better for us – it’s about working better in our jobs once we’ve taken a realistic look at what we’re doing."

They lost a thousand dollars each betting on the wrong horse.  They are recuperating after the strain.  They are booked for judges of the Supreme Court when they finish this job.  The negro mass-meeting to-night is to indorse their names for the Supreme Bench.\r\n\r\n \"Is it possible!\"  the doctor exclaimed.\r\n\r\n When Whipper resumed his place at his desk, the introduction of bills began.  One after another were sent to the Speaker's desk, a measure to disarm the whites and equip with modern rifles a Negro militia of 80,000 men;  to make the uniform of Confederate gray the garb of convicts in South Carolina, with the sign of rank to signify the degree of crime;  to prevent any person calling another a \"nigger\";  to require men to remove their hats in the presence of all officers, civil or military, and all disfranchised men to remove their hats in the presence of voters;  to force whites and blacks to attend the same schools and open the State University to negroes;  to permit the intermarriage of whites and blacks;  and to inforce social equality.\r\n\r\n Whipper made a brief speech on the last measure:\r\n\r\n    \"Before I am through, I mean that it shall be known that Napoleon Whipper is as good as any man in South\r\n\r\n Page 269\r\n Carolina.  Don't tell me that I am not on an equality with any man God ever made.\"\r\n\r\n Dr. Cameron turned pale, and trembling with excitement, asked his friend:\r\n\r\n    \"Can that man pass such measures, and the Governor sign them?\"\r\n\r\n \"He can pass anything he wishes.  The Governor is his creature — a dirty little scalawag who tore the Union flag from Fort Sumter, trampled it in the dust, and helped raise the flag of the Confederacy over it.  Now he is backed by the Government at Washington.  He won his election by dancing at negro balls and the purchase of delegates.  His salary as Governor is $3,500 a year, and he spends over $40,000.  Comment is unnecessary.  This Legislature has stolen millions of dollars, and already bankrupted the treasury.  The day Howle was elected to the Senate of the United States, every negro on the floor had his roll of bills and some of them counted it out on their desks.  In your day the annual cost of the State government was $400,000.  This year it is $2,000,000.  These thieves steal daily.  They don't deny it.  They simply dare you to prove it.  The writing-paper on the desks cost $16,000.  These clocks on the wall $600 each, and every little Radical newspaper in the state has been subsidised in sums varying from $1,000 to $7,000.  Each member is allowed to draw for mileage, per diem, and \"sundries.\"  God only knows what the bill for \"sundries\" will aggregate by the end of the session.\"\r\n\r\n \"I couldn't conceive of this!\" "

        "text":"Why are employees such as nurses and teachers in \"caring professions\" a lot happier than highly-paid commercial lawyers?\r\n\r\n Arun Abey, executive director of ipac financial planning, says there are three sources of happiness for people.  While the first source of happiness is derived from consuming and buying material items, this is not a long-lasting source of happiness, he says.  \r\n\r\n Another source of happiness is in partaking in engaging activities that require the use of skills.  The third source of happiness is having a positive effect on others, which from a HR standpoint, is the real source of highly engaged workforce, Abey says.  And this does not require for a person to be working at a senior level as well, Abey says. \r\n\r\n This is why people in \"caring professions\" such as teachers and nurses who while not highly paid, have a greater sense of well-being than commercial lawyers whose work is of an adversarial nature. \r\n\r\n Abey cites an incident where he was in a Sri Lakan hospital where the hospital orderly had taken upon himself to make helicopters out of used plastic IV drips for the children in the ward.  When the orderly was asked why he was doing this, he said he was helping in the recovery of the patients. \r\n\r\n \"He had taken a lowly activity and had re-crafted it into a higher calling.  From his viewpoint, he was part of the medical care team, he didn't have the professional qualifications, but he played a role in patient care and recovery,\" says Abey. \r\n\r\n So how can employees derive a greater sense of well-being from their jobs?  The trick is to  recognise how a job can become a greater calling.  \"In whatever your job, you should take a step back and say, 'How can I think of it as a calling?'\" \r\n\r\n Abey adds that great companies constantly reinforce to their employees on how the product or service has an impact on the lives of people.  When Toyota was looking to compete against General Motors and Ford after the Second World War, the company first had to raise the quality standards of their cars. \r\n\r\n So Toyota created a fictional customer called Mrs Jones who was introduced to everyone on the factory floor, says Abey.  Employees were encouraged to think of Mrs Jones and how the reliability of their car would affect her life in chauffering her family around to school and work.   \" [The scenario] gave their jobs a context and it made their jobs more meaningful,\" Abey says."

Now, his in­vention dominates the modem media.  This is its story.\r\n\r\n John Logie Baird produced the first television pictures just eight years after the First World War.  They were in black and white and were not very clear, but he had proved that the prin­ciple worked.  Early sets made in the years Baird’s break­through cost as much as a small car and not many were sold.  Soon, though, his original system was improved and in 1936 Britain's first regular TV programme went on the air.  \"Here's Looking At You\" was broadcast by the BBC from north Lon­don's Alexandra Palace studios twice a day for a weekly bud­get of one thousand pounds.  But Great Britain wasn't the only country producing programmes.  Other European nations, in­cluding Germany, were also involved in the early days of television.  As, of course, was America  —  and it's there that the real TV revolution began after World War Two.\r\n\r\n US television boomed in the late '40s.  Commercial stations began to open in almost every city, and national networks made programmes which were seen from coast to coast.  One of the American networks  —  CBS  —  even developed a colour service as early as 1951.  Two years later, TV took another important step when it covered its first major international event  —  the coronation of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.  It was the first time that a worldwide audience of millions had seen history take place in their own homes.\r\n\r\n By the end of the decade, TV culture was rapidly becoming a fact of life on both sides of the Atlantic.  Even so, it was still a very young medium  —  lots of people didn't have sets  —  and many experts thought it wouldn't last.  That all changed in the '60s and '70s, though, as television started to satisfy the pub­lic's desire, not just for entertainment, but also for rapid, accu­rate information.  As more and more sets were sold, the impor­tance of TV news quickly grew.  After all  —  what other medium could show you live  —  as TV did in 1969  —  Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon?\r\n\r\n Since 1980 there have been four more major developments.  The first is video, which has given viewers the power to control what they watch and when they watch it.  These days, fifty per cent of homes have a VCR (video-cassette recorder) and mil­lions more are being sold every year.\r\n\r\n The second is satellite TV.  Thanks to DBS (direct broadcast satellites), dozens of new channels are now available to anyone who buys a receiving \"dish\".  Many of these new,channels spe­cialize in one kind of programme  —  e. g. news, sport, cartoons, music, movies.\r\n\r\n The third development is cable  —  a system of hi-tech wires, which provides even more channels... at a price.  But not only that.  Cable also makes it possible for you to communicate through your TV, not just the other way around.  More about that in a moment.\r\n\r\n Fourthly, there's HDTV (high definition television), which now offers a much clearer and more realistic picture than was possible even a few years ago.\r\n\r\n So ... more channels, more choice, more clarity.  What is there left for TV to achieve in the future?  The answer to that is two-way communication.  Modern technology means that twen­ty-first century televisions will be linked to computer data­banks. "

Hal spits thickly and gathers and tries to spit again, watching.\r\n Troeltsch broadcasts the fact that there's always a queer vague vitaminish stink about Mary Esther Thode that he never can quite place.  There's the sudden tripartite whump of three Empire Waste Displacement vehicles being propelled above the cloud-cover to points far north.  Hal identifies Thode's ambient odor as the stink of thiamine, which for reasons best known to Thode she takes a lot of;  and Troeltsch broadcasts the datum and refers to Hal as a 'close source,' which strikes Hal as odd and somehow off in a way he can't quite name.  Kittenplan shakes Chu's arm loose and darts over and extracts a warhead from SOVWAR's portable stockpile and shouts out that well OK then if players can be targets then in that case: and she fires a real screamer at IngersolPs head, which Ingersoll barely blocks with his Rossignol and shrieks that Kittenplan can't launch anything at anything because she's been vaporized by a 5-megaton contact-burst.  Kittenplan tells Ingersoll to write his congressman about it and over LaMont Chu's pleas for reasoned discussion takes several more theoretically valuable warheads out of the industrial-solvent bucket and gets truly serious about hitting Ingersoll, moving steadily east across Nigeria and Chad, causing Ingersoll to run due north across the courts' map at impressive speed, abandoning IRLIBSYR's ammo-bucket and tear-assing up through Siberia crying Foul.  Lord's mewing ineffectually for order, but some of the other Combatants' staffs have begun to smell that Evan Ingersoll's become fair game for cruelty  —  the way kids can seem to smell this sort of thing out with such uncanny acuity  —  and REDCHPs General Secretary and an AM-NAT vector-planning specialist and Josh Gopnik all start moving northeast over the map firing balls as hard as they can at Ingersoll, who's dropped his launcher and is shaking frantically at the chained gate on the fence's north side, where Mrs. Incandenza has decided she doesn't want kids exiting the East Courts and trampling her calliopsis;  and these little kids can hit balls exceptionally hard.  Hal is now unable to gather enough spit to spit.  One warhead hits Ingersoll in the neck and another solidly in the meat of the thigh.  Ingersoll begins to limp around in small circles holding his neck, crying in that slow-motion shuddery way little kids have when they're crying more at the fact of being hurt than at the hurt itself.  Pemulis is walking backwards away from the south fence back toward the pavilion and has both arms up in either appeal or fury or something else.  Axford tells Hal and Troeltsch he wishes he didn't feel the dark thrill he felt watching Ingersoll get pummeled.  Some filmy red peanutskin has gotten into Jim Struck's hair as he lies there motionless.  O. P. Lord attempts to rule that Ingersoll is no longer on the four courts of Eschaton's earth-map and so isn't even theoretically a valid target-area.\r\n It doesn't matter.  Several kids close in on Ingersoll, triangulating their bombardment, T. Peterson on point.\r\n Ingersoll is hit several times, once right near the eye.  Jim Troeltsch is up and running to the fence wanting to stop the thing, but Pemulis catches him by his headset's cord and tells him to let them all lie in their own bed.  Hal, now leaning forward, steeple-fingered, finds himself just about paralyzed with absorption.\r\n Trevor Axford, fist to his chin, asks Hal if he's ever just simply fucking hated somebody without having any idea why.  Hal finds himself riveted at something about the degenerating game that seems so terribly abstract and fraught with implications and consequences that even thinking about how to articulate it seems so complexly stressful that being almost incapacitated with absorption is almost the only way out of the complex stress.  Now INDPAK's Penn and AMNAT's McKenna, who have long-standing personal bones to pick with Ann Kittenplan, peel off and gather ordnance and execute a pincer movement on Ann Kittenplan.  She is hit twice from behind at close range.  Ingersoll has long since gone down and is still getting hit.  Lord is ruling at the top of his lungs that there's no way AMNAT can launch against itself when he gets tagged right on the breastbone by an errant warhead.  Clutching his chest with one hand, with the other he flicks the red beanie's propeller, never before flicked, whose flicked spin heralds a worst-case- &-utterly-decontrolled-Armageddon-type situation.  Timmy Peterson takes a ball in the groin and goes down like a sack of refined flour.  Everybody's scooping up spent warheads and totally unrealistically refiring them.  The fences shudder and sing as balls rain against them.  Ingersoll now resembles some sort of animal that's been run over in the road.  Troeltsch, who's looking for the first time at the idling sedan by West House's dump-sters and asking if anybody knew anybody who drove a Nunhagen-Aspirin-adverting Ford, is the only upperclass spectator who doesn't seem utterly silently engrossed.  Ann Kittenplan has dropped her racquet and is charging McKenna.  She takes two contact-bursts in the breast-area before she gets to him and lays McKenna out with an impressive left cross.  LaMont Chu tackles Todd Possalthwaite from behind.  Struck looks to have wet his pants in his sleep.  J. J. Penn slips on a grounded warhead near Fiji and goes spectacularly down.  The snowfall makes everything gauzy and terribly clear at the same time, eliminating all visual background so that the map's action seems stark and surreal.  Nobody's using tennis balls now anymore.  Josh Gopnik punches LaMont Chu in the stomach, and LaMont Chu yells that he's been punched in the stomach.  Ann Kittenplan has Kieran McKenna in a headlock and is punching him repeatedly on the top of the skull.  Otis P. Lord lets down the beach umbrella and starts pushing his crazywheeled food cart at a diskette-rattling clip toward 12's open south gate, still flicking furiously at the red beanie's propeller.  Struck's hair is steadily accreting nut-skins.  Pemulís is under cover but still standing, his legs well apart and his arms folded.  The figure in the green Ford still hasn't moved once.  Troeltsch says he for his own part wouldn't be just sitting and lying there if any of the Little Buddies under his personal charge were out there getting potentially injured, and Hal reflects that he does feel a certain sort of intense anxiety, but can't sort through the almost infinite-seeming implications of what Troeltsch is saying fast enough to determine whether the anxiety is over something about what he's seeing or something in the connection between what Troeltsch is saying and the degree to which he's absorbed in what's going on out inside the fence, which is a degenerative chaos so complex in its disorder that it's hard to tell whether it seems choreographed or simply chaotically disordered.  LaMont Chu is throwing up into the Indian Ocean.  Todd Possalthwaite has his hands to his face and is shrieking something about his 'doze.'  It is now, beyond any argument or equivocation, snowing.  The sky is off-white.  Lord and his cart are now literally making tracks for the edge of the map.  Evan Ingersoll hasn't moved in several minutes.  Penn lies in a whitening service box with one leg bent beneath him at an impossible angle.  Someone way off behind them has been blowing an athletic whistle.  Ann Kittenplan begins to chase REDCHI's General Secretary south across the Asian subcontinent at top speed.  Pemulis is telling Hal he hates to say he told them so.\r\n Hal can see Axford leaning way forward sheltering something tiny from the wind as he flicks at it with a spent lighter.  It occurs to him this is the third anniversary of Axhandle losing a right finger and half his right thumb.  Fierce little J. Gopnik is flailing at the air and telling whoever wants it to come on, come on.\r\n Otis P. Lord and his cart sail clattering across Indochina toward the southern gate.  Hal is suddenly aware that Troeltsch and Pemulis are wincing but is not himself wincing and isn't sure why they are wincing and is looking out into the fray trying to determine whether he should be wincing when REDCHI's General Secretary, calling loudly for his mother and in full flight as he looks over his shoulder at Ann Kittenplan's contorted face, barrels directly into Lord's speeding food cart.  There's a noise like the historical sum of all cafeteria accidents everywhere.  3.6-MB diskettes take flight like mad bats across what uncovered would be the baseline of Court 12.  Different-colored beanies spill from the rolling solander box, whose lock's hasp is broken and protrudes like a tongue as it rolls.  The TP's monitor and modem and Yushityu chassis, with most of Eschaton's nervous system on its hard drive, assume a parabolic southwest vector.\r\n The heavy equipment's altitude is impressive.  An odd silent still moment hangs, the TP aloft.  Pemulis bellows, his hands to his cheeks.  Otis P. Lord hurdles the bent forms of food cart and General Secretary and sprints low over the court's map's snow, trying to save hardware that's now at the top of its rainbow's arc.  It's clear Lord won't make it.  It's a slow-motion moment.  The snowfall's more than heavy enough now, Hal thinks, to excuse Lord's not seeing LaMont Chu directly before him, on his hands and knees, throwing up.  Lord impacts Chu's arched form at about knee-level and is spectacularly airborne.  The idling Ford reveals a sudden face at the driver's-side window.  Axford is holding the lighter's chassis up to his ear and shaking it.  Ann Kittenplan is ramming REDCHI's leader's face repeatedly into the mesh of the south fence.  Lord's flight's parabola is less spectacular on the y-axis than the TP's has been.  The Yushityu's hard-drive chassis makes an indescribable sound as it hits the earth and its brightly circuited guts come out.  The color monitor lands on its back with its screen blinking ERROR at the white sky.  Hal and everyone else can project Lord's flight's own terminus an instant before impact.  For a brief moment that Hal will later regard as completely and uncomfortably bizarre, Hal feels at his own face to see whether he is wincing.  The distant whistle patweets.  Lord does indeed go headfirst down through the monitor's screen, and stays there, his sneakers in the air and his warm-up pants sagging upward to reveal black socks.  There'd been a bad sound of glass.  Penn flails on his back.  Possalthwaite, Ingersoll, and McKenna bleed.  The second shift's 1600h.  siren down at Sunstrand Power & Light is creepily muffled by the no-sound of falling snow.\r\n 8 NOVEMBER YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT\r\n INTERDEPENDENCE DAY GAUDEAMUS IGITUR\r\n Boston AA is Jike AA nowhere else on this planet.  Just like AA everyplace else, Boston AA is divided into numerous individual AA Groups, and each Group has its particular Group name like the Reality Group or the Allston Group or the Clean and Sober Group, and each Group holds its regular meeting once a week.  But almost all Boston Groups' meetings are speaker meetings.  That means that at the meetings there are recovering alcoholic speakers who stand up in front of everybody at an amplified podium and 'share their experience, strength, and hope.'  (131) And the singular thing is that these speakers are not ever members of the Group that's holding the meeting, in Boston.  The speakers at one certain Group's weekly speaker meeting are always from some other certain Boston AA Group.  The people from the other Group who are here at like your Group speaking are here on something called a Commitment.\r\n Commitments are where some members of one Group commit to hit the road and travel to another Group's meeting to speak publicly from the podium.  Then a bunch of people from the host Group hit the opposite lane of the same road on some other night and go to the visiting Group's meeting, to speak.  Groups always trade Commitments: you come speak to us and we'll come speak to you.  It can seem bizarre.  You always go elsewhere to speak.  At your own Group's meeting you're a host;  you just sit there and listen as hard as you can, and you make coffee in 60-cup urns and stack polystyrene cups in big ziggurats and sell raffle tickets and make sandwiches, and you empty ashtrays and scrub out urns and sweep floors when the other Group's speakers are through.  You never share your experience, strength, and hope on-stage behind a fiberboard podium with its cheap nondigital PA system's mike except in front of some other metro Boston Group.  (132) Every night in Boston, bumper-stickered cars full of totally sober people, wall-eyed from caffeine and trying to read illegibly scrawled directions by the dashboard lights, crisscross the city, heading for the church basements or bingo halls or nursing-home cafeterias of other AA Groups, to put on Commitments.  Being an active member of a Boston AA Group is probably a little bit like being a serious musician or like athlete, in terms of constant travel.\r\n The White Flag Group of Enfield MA, in metropolitan Boston, meets Sundays in the cafeteria of the Provident Nursing Home on Hanneman Street, off Commonwealth Avenue a couple blocks west of Enfield Tennis Academy's flat-topped hill.  Tonight the White Flag Group is hosting a Commitment from the Advanced Basics Group of Concord, a suburb of Boston.  The Advanced Basics people have driven almost an hour to get here, plus there's always the problem of signless urban streets and directions given over the phone.  On this coming Friday night, a small horde of White Flag-gers will drive out to Concord to put on a reciprocal Commitment for the Advanced Basics Group.  Travelling long distances on signless streets trying to parse directions like 'Take the second left off the rotary by the driveway to the chiropractor's' and getting lost and shooting your whole evening after a long day just to speak for like six minutes at a plywood podium is called 'Getting Active With Your Group';  the speaking itself is known as '12th-Step Work' or 'Giving It Away.'

I swear, darkies are more trouble.  Sometimes I think the Abolitionists have got the right idea.”\r\n “Well, it wouldn’t be right to make Jeems face what we don’t want to face.  We’ll have to take him.  But, look, you impudent black fool, if you put on any airs in front of the Wynder darkies and hint that we all the time have fried chicken and ham, while they don’t have nothing but rabbit and possum, I’ll  —  I’ll tell Ma.  And we won’t let you go to the war with us, either.”\r\n “Airs?  Me put on airs fo’ dem cheap niggers?  Nawsuh, Ah got better manners.  Ain’ Miss Beetriss taught me manners same as she taught y’all?”\r\n “She didn’t do a very good job on any of the three of us,” said Stuart.  “Come on, let’s get going.”\r\n He backed his big red horse and then, putting spurs to his side, lifted him easily over the split rail fence into the soft field of Gerald O’Hara’s plantation.  Brent’s horse followed and then Jeems’, with Jeems clinging to pommel and mane.  Jeems did not like to jump fences, but he had jumped higher ones than this in order to keep up with his masters.\r\n As they picked their way across the red furrows and down the hill to the river bottom in the deepening dusk, Brent yelled to his brother:\r\n“Look, Stu!  Don’t it seem like to you that Scarlett WOULD have asked us to supper?”\r\n “I kept thinking she would,” yelled Stuart.  “Why do you suppose . .  .”"
