Tell them, you know, what your house looked like at the time of the recording.\r\n Objection.\r\n Relevance?  Well, the circumstances of the recording are materially relevant.\r\n How can you know what the tape really means unless you know what was going on when it was recorded?  Overruled.\r\n The witness can answer the question.\r\n I covered most of the walls with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.\r\n I also hung a number of space blankets.\r\n Compact Mylar sheets.\r\n They insulate and protect against mild electromagnetic radiation.\r\n [Sighs] All right, so, shiny insulation and space blankets all over the walls and the ceiling.\r\n [Chuckling] It was like being inside of a disco ball.\r\n Do you have a point?  Well, um, I'm impressed by how much work went into entrapping me.\r\n You went all out.\r\n I didn't entrap you.\r\n I provoked an admission in adverse interest.\r\n That's not the same thing.\r\n How did you know it would work?  What do you mean?  How did you know your \"provocation\" would work?  Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic would make me say anything?  Isn't it because you knew that it was precisely the thing that would worry me so much that I'd say anything to talk you down?  - Objection.\r\n - Okay.\r\n Withdrawn.\r\n Let's let's get back to your house, every surface covered in tinfoil.\r\n Nothing crazy about that, huh?  As I've said, I was playing up my condition.\r\n Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.\r\n You think your house is normal?  Can I call your attention to Exhibit Nine?  This is your house, right?  Yes.\r\n So, exposed wires.\r\n [Pages turning] There's a camp stove.\r\n There's a lantern on top of newspapers.\r\n You call this normal?  I call them adaptations.\r\n A prophylactic measure for a physical, medical condition.\r\n Did the doctor who granted me guardianship for you - think this was a physical condition?  - Objection.\r\n You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.\r\n Besides which, the panel has already ruled that Mr.\r\n McGill's mental health is not at issue.\r\n No, the State Bar opened the door to this on direct when the witness talked about his supposed \"play-acting.\r\n \" Allowing me to follow up on cross is only reasonable.\r\n We discussed the physical allergy, not a mental disability.\r\n Potato, po-tah-to.\r\n It comes down to this In order to understand what I was thinking, you need to see Chuck through my eyes.\r\n You need to know if I believed that tape was evidence.\r\n And I say it was evidence of only one thing My brother hates me.\r\n Now, he claims that he lied to me to get me to tell the truth.\r\n And I'm telling you I lied to my brother to make him feel better.\r\n Which of us you believe depends on how we all understand the mind of Charles McGill.\r\n Well, we did promise the defense some leeway.\r\n You may proceed.\r\n - Thank you, Mr.\r\n Chairman.\r\n - But watch yourself.\r\n Chuck, I'd like to go back a little further, talk about when these symptoms first started.\r\n It was shortly after you were divorced, is that right?  Yes.\r\n You think the stress of the divorce brought on the illness?  I doubt it.\r\n It was an amicable split.\r\n My ex-wife and I are still on good terms.\r\n In fact, your ex-wife is present with us today, is she not?  When was the last time you two saw each other?  Objection.\r\n This is not family court.\r\n We're not here to re-litigate the witness' divorce.\r\n I can't see what purpose this serves.\r\n I can.\r\n I'll tell you why my brother brought my ex-wife to this hearing.\r\n 4,000 miles she came, lured by concern for me.\r\n What Jimmy's driving at is the last time I saw her, I covered up my illness.\r\n I'd been suffering from it for some time, but I went to great lengths to conceal that fact from her.\r\n I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.\r\n [Sighs] I didn't want you to think less of me.\r\n Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.\r\n You know why?  To rattle me.\r\n He knows I still have a [Voice breaking] a lot of, feeling for my ex-wife.\r\n He's hoping this will break me down.\r\n Split me apart at the seams, like a murderer confessing on an episode of \"Perry Mason.\r\n \" Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jimmy.\r\n Have I answered your questions to your satisfaction?  Do you have anything else?  Yeah, I do.\r\n Earlier, you talked about other diseases.\r\n Physical conditions, you said.\r\n Uh, so, okay, if you'd had, um I don't know lung cancer, would you have told Rebecca then?  [Sighs] If that had been the case, maybe.\r\n I might have.\r\n - So how is this different?  - Mr.\r\n McGill.\r\n Move it along.\r\n You don't have to answer that.\r\n I want to get down to brass tacks.\r\n I want to be very, very specific here.\r\n This illness, what does it feel like?  You mentioned it's painful.\r\n It is.\r\n [Breathes sharply] There's a tightness in my chest, difficulty breathing, and pain, burning pain.\r\n The pain spreads everywhere.\r\n Sounds horrible.\r\n Does it hurt right now?  There's always some discomfort, yes.\r\n Electricity is everywhere in the modern world.\r\n [Sighs] But I very much appreciate the indulgence of the panel for their accommodation here today.\r\n I can handle this fine.\r\n [Sighs] Right, so, with the lights out, you don't feel them?  Chuck: If the current's not flowing, no.\r\n - [Door creaks] - Oh.\r\n Sorry about the exit signs.\r\n I guess they couldn't kill those for you.\r\n Well, they're not drawing much current, and they're far away.\r\n [Door creaks] Intensity drops off with distance, per the inverse-square law.\r\n [Chuckling] Okay, whoa!  Inverse-square I'm not a physicist.\r\n Could you dumb that down a shade for me?  The farther away it is, the stronger the source needs to be to have an effect.\r\n Got it.\r\n Got it.\r\n So, if I had a small battery, say, from a watch or something, and I got it close to you, close to your skin, you'd know?  I would feel it, yes.\r\n Can you feel more current coming from any particular direction right now?  Uh, from that back wall or, uh, from over there or up through the floor?  Can you tell us where the nearest source is right now?  Jimmy, do you have something in your pocket?  Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.\r\n My cellphone.\r\n From this distance, you should feel it, and you don't, do you?  Mr.\r\n McGill, you were warned to leave your electronics outside.\r\n It's all right.\r\n It's all right.\r\n May I?  Ah.\r\n Just as I thought.\r\n There's no battery in here.\r\n You removed the battery.\r\n [Cellphone clicks] [Chuckling] That's a sorry little trick, isn't it?  Yeah, you got me, Chuck.\r\n Dead to rights.\r\n - [Sighs] - I removed the battery.\r\n - Objection.\r\n - Sustained.\r\n Y-You've taken all the leeway you're getting, Mr.\r\n McGill.\r\n Wrap it up fast.\r\n God, Jimmy.\r\n [Sighs] Don't you know by now this is real?  I feel this.\r\n It's a physical response to stimuli.\r\n It's not a quirk.\r\n [Sighs] What do I have to do to prove it to you?  I don't know, Chuck.\r\n Could you reach into your breast pocket and tell me what's there?  [Scoffs] What now?  Can you tell the court what that was?  - A battery.\r\n - Mr.\r\n Chairman, please.\r\n Do you recognize that man in back?  His name is Huell Babineaux.\r\n He's on our witness list.\r\n You bumped into him in the stairway.\r\n He'll testify he planted this fully charged battery on you over an hour and a half ago.\r\n Hour and 43 minutes ago.\r\n An hour and 43 minutes.\r\n Thank you, Mr.\r\n Babineaux.\r\n And you felt nothing.\r\n - [Cellphone beeps] - No, no, no.\r\n - No, no.\r\n It's a trick.\r\n It has to - Enough is enough.\r\n I submit that Mr.\r\n McGill's mental illness is a non-issue.\r\n - If he were schizophrenic - Schizo it wouldn't take away from the fact - that the defendant - I am not crazy!  [Chuckling] I am not crazy.\r\n I know he swapped those numbers.\r\n I knew it was 1216.\r\n One after Magna Carta.\r\n As if I could ever make such a mistake.\r\n Never.\r\n Never!  I just I just couldn't prove it.\r\n H-H-He covered his tracks.\r\n He got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him.\r\n Alley: Mr.\r\n McGill, please.\r\n You don't have to go in You think this is something?  You think this is bad, this this chicanery?  He's done worse.\r\n That billboard!  Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that?  No.\r\n He orchestrated it!  Jimmy!  He defecated through a sunroof!  [Chuckling] And I saved him, and I shouldn't have.\r\n I took him into my own firm.\r\n What was I thinking?!  He'll never change.\r\n He'll never change.\r\n Ever since he was 9, always the same.\r\n Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer.\r\n But not our Jimmy.\r\n Couldn't be precious Jimmy!  Stealing them blind.\r\n And he gets to be a lawyer?!  What a sick joke!  [Voice breaking] I should have stopped him when I had the chance!  And you you have to stop him!  You [Breathes deeply] I apologize.\r\n I lost my train of thought.\r\n [Sighs] I got carried away.\r\n [Clears throat] Do you have anything else?  No.\r\n Nothing further.\r\n [Sighs] [Electricity humming loudly] \r\n\r\n Read more: http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=better-call-saul-2015&episode=s03e05"

        "text":"Hi.  So our world today is a far more sexually permissive place than it used to be 50 years ago.\r\n\r\n These days, for most people, premarital sex is okay, oral sex is okay.  In this post “50 Shades of Grey” era, even kinky sex is okay.  But we’re still very conflicted as a society and as individuals over whether it’s acceptable and healthy to have casual sex  —  sex outside the confines of long-term, romantic relationships.\r\n\r\n We are constantly surrounded by it, yet we are often told it’s bad for us, we shouldn’t be doing it.  By the time we are 25, 70% of us will have hooked up at least once, and yet most of us will worry we shouldn’t really be doing it.\r\n\r\n But there’s something that doesn’t make sense here to me about this love-hate relationship we have with casual sex.  We all seem to agree that sex with a romantic partner has all these amazing benefits, from longer and healthier lives, to better relationships and greater happiness.\r\n\r\n So, how come that same sexual activity has the exact opposite effect if our partner is a stranger or a friend?  Is sex somehow good for us only because of the love and commitment we feel for our partners?  And without that love and commitment, it automatically turns into a destructive force?  Isn’t there something good in just, you know, sex?\r\n\r\n When I started my PhD in Developmental Psychology, I decided to get to the bottom of this.  Is casual sex objectively bad for us?  Or is this just another grossly over-exaggerated moral sex panic that the US has had no shortage of?\r\n\r\n In the 10 years since, we’ve learned a great deal about casual sex from social science research  —  my own and that of other scholars.  But virtually 90% of that knowledge is based on US undergrads.  And trust me, you are not the only people hooking up.\r\n\r\n So to supplement our knowledge and understanding of this phenomenon, I started this website, called “The Casual Sex Project.”  It’s an online space for people of all demographic backgrounds to share their true stories of hook ups.\r\n\r\n My hope was to give people a chance to tell their stories, make sense of their experiences through this process of storytelling, but also, to paint a more diverse, richer picture of what casual sex really looks like;  what it means to people, what it feels like, what its aftermath may be.\r\n\r\n In the 10 months since the website’s been up, it’s been viewed over six million times.  Over 1200 stories have been shared by people from all over the world, and it’s been written about on six continents.\r\n\r\n So what have all these stories and studies taught us about casual sex and well-being?  Well, here are a few things that you may not have been aware of.\r\n\r\n First of all, casual sex has many potential benefits.  Perhaps the most obvious one is sexual pleasure.  Orgasms, hedonic ecstasy, if you will.  Then there are things like learning new sexual skills, making new friends, it’s a good one.  An increased sense of self-confidence, accomplishment, desirability, empowerment, freedom.\r\n\r\n Then there are collecting fun stories and memories to tell your friends at the senior citizens’ home, many years later, or share on the casual sex project.  There’s even experiencing that deep, emotional, spiritual, intellectual connection with another human being that sometimes happens even though no romantic feelings are involved.\r\n\r\n But casual sex has yet another powerful pull on us.  As Esther Perel so eloquently puts it, humans have this fundamental need for adventure, novelty, mystery, risk, danger, the unknown, the unexpected.  Some more than others, but it’s there in our DNA.  And that is a need that casual sex satisfies effortlessly by its very nature, and it’s a need that’s much more difficult, if not impossible, to meet in the long-term part of long-term relationships.\r\n\r\n Now, there are of course risks: unsatisfying sex, broken hearts, ruined friendships, regret, coercion, confusion, awkwardness, STIs and unwanted pregnancies, social stigma, disrespectful partners.\r\n\r\n Now, people fear that most of the time these cons outweigh the pros.  But that is simply not true.  Study after study finds this pattern for how people feel following their hook ups.  For both men and women alike, positive post-hook-up reactions  —  happy, pleased, excited  —  are much stronger than negative hook up reactions: used, empty, disappointed.\r\n\r\n Other studies show that casual sex has little to no impact on longer-term psychological well-being.  Things like self-esteem, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety.\r\n\r\n Now, of course, this doesn’t mean that all hook-ups follow this pattern, or that this pattern is typical of everybody who hooks up, and that no one’s well-being is ever affected.  No, these are just averages.\r\n\r\n When you look more closely at the people and the experiences making up these averages, you find that some hook-ups do indeed have the potential to harm or benefit well-being.  And some people are more susceptible to that potential.  So whether casual sex is good for you or not depends on who you are and how you do it.\r\n\r\n There are many factors that this relationship can depend on, and I couldn’t possibly cover all of them in one 18 minute talk.  But one critical one is “authenticity.”  Doing only the kinds of things that are fully in line with who you are;  your beliefs, your values, your desires, your needs.\r\n\r\n Casual sex is not for everyone.  Nothing sexual ever is, really.  Due to differences in nature, nurture, and life circumstances, some of us have a much stronger general need for sexual novelty, and much greater comfort having sex with people we don’t know very well.  So figure out where you are on this spectrum.  Is hooking up with people you’re not dating something that sounds enjoyable, exciting, an important experience to have?  Morally acceptable to you?  Would you be hooking up with this person even if you are never going to see them afterwards?  If the answer to most of these is “no,” you shouldn’t really be doing it.\r\n\r\n Now, there’s a bit of an elephant in the room when we talk about pleasure in heterosexual casual sex: the orgasm gap between men and women.  In a study of over 20,000 undergrads, 80% of men had an orgasm during their most recent hook up.  This was true of only 40% of women.\r\n\r\n Now, there’s an orgasm gap in romantic encounters too, but it’s twice as large in hook ups.  This doesn’t mean that women aren’t enjoying it necessarily.  In this same study, 90% of the women said they enjoyed their hook up very much, or at least somewhat.  Most of them enjoyed it very much, about 70 plus percent.\r\n\r\n But we can all do better.  I mean, this gap needs closing.  Women need to learn to be more selfish, demand their sexual pleasure.  And men need to learn to be more giving, try harder to please their partners, even in the briefest of one night stands.  You know, casual sex doesn’t have to be devoid of all intimacy and passion.  It’s not like you’re doing laundry or picking up your mail.  Try to give and get as much sexual pleasure out of every hook up.  That’s the whole point."

        "text":"Abstract\r\nThe cognitive approach of learning agrees in that behavior of the individual correlates with certain complex and dynamic mental processing operations modulated by certain internal mechanisms learned or improved during life.  Applied to university learning, the demand towards students no longer focuses only in the results of the process but, ideally, in the development of individual styles based on cognitive preferences and learning strategies.  Several tests such as Kolb and VAK or Hermann dominances allow distinguishing some learning styles such as: Divergent, Assimilator, Convergent and Accommodator;  Visual;  Kinesthetic;  and Auditory.  Meanwhile, by using electrophysiological tools like an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording it is now possible to measure individual differences in the varying electrical activity present in the cerebral cortex while a student face a cognitive problem or performs a test of intelligence.  In this study, we tested 20 students from their early years of engineering to be classified in three systems of learning styles.  The students were then subjected to a test of intelligence (Raven test, abbreviated version of 15 questions) with increasing levels of complexity.  The time length to solve the test taken for students previously classified in four main styles yielded by the Kolb test, were analyzed.  Then we grouped them by correspondences with the visual, auditory and kinesthetic predominance yielded by the VAK test.  The response time was measured and the absolute frequency of response time for each question was calculated.  During the Raven test execution an electroencephalogram with Emotiv Epoc Brain-Computer Interface of 14 channels was recorded.  After subtracting baseline and eliminating common artifacts with the help of EEGLAB toolbox under Matlab, we obtained clean signals for theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands.  Using the set of learning styles classificatory tools and the electrophysiological analysis we started to look for variability and consistencies that support or rise new questions about adequate usefulness of common used psycho-cognitive and behavioral learning styles tests.  In our sample we found relatively low discriminative resolution from all learning styles test applied, but a promising research field to study electrical brain activity phenomenology associated with learning and solving problem strategies of the brain."

So we need to eliminate them.   Investigate.   Experiment.   We send some people to check out Tarleton’s background, as best we can, and see if he was just an actor all along or if he started behaving oddly.   We send some people to look into the friend who was hired at the same time as him, if possible.   And whatever else we think of, that we can safely do.   I’ll speak to the Westphalians — these inquiries make sense if we really do think it’s Malfoy, and I think I can sell that.”\r\n\r\n “Got it,” Tonks said, nodding.   “Esther will go with you.

What if this is less complicated than we think, with all these deductions and guesses all in a flurry?”  Tonks asked.   “Or even worse, what if it was Harry… do you really want to push this investigation so hard that you, um, win?   And have to face him?”\r\n\r\n Hermione sighed.   “We’re investigating our friend’s possible involvement in a bombing, or maybe even two bombings.   What investigation needs dedication more?

        "text":"  Jeremy Brendan Sears got his start in the “Bieber Hijacking and Trolling Company,” an online group that trolled girls’ fan-sites for Bieber and the boyband One Direction.168 Soon, Sears struck out on his own, harassing the young website owners and spamming their pages in order to extort the girls for explicit photos and videos.169 The fans, who had invested months or even\r\n years of work in collecting pictures of their idols, were desperate to regain control over their webpages  —  which was exactly what made them vulnerable to Sears.170 Sears would also catfish victims using fake social media profiles and post victims’ contact information online, promising to remove it only if the victims provided photographs or video.171 When nterviewed by the FBI, Sears stated that his sextortion had “a very minor sexual thing to it,” but that the primary appeal was the “power” it offered him over his victims.172\r\n Christopher Patrick Gunn was charged with six counts of producing child pornography, two counts of possessing child pornography, seven counts of stalking, 20 counts of extortion, and eight counts of interstate transmission in aid of extortion.173 He pleaded guilty to two counts of producing child pornography and four counts of extortion,174\r\n and was sentenced to 35 years in prison.175\r\n Jeremy Brendan Sears received a sentence of 15 years176 after pleading guilty to just one count of producing child pornography.177 He was originally charged with 16 counts of \r\n  roducing child pornography, 11 counts of distributing or receiving child pornography, one count of possessing child pornography, one count of extortion, one count of computer fraud, and one count of aggravated identity theft.178\r\n RICHARD FINKBINER\r\n When FBI agents searched Richard Finkbiner’s rural Indiana home in 2012, they discovered more than 22,000\r\n video files saved on his computer, roughly half of which were sexually explicit and most of which depicted minors.179\r\n Finkbiner routinely sextorted so many people for these videos, he told the FBI, that it was impossible for him to recognize the images of any one particular victim that agents had presented to him: he had too many victims to recall them individually.180\r\n Finkbiner would reach out to potential victims  —  usually teenage boys  —  through Omegle or other anonymous chatting programs.  Like Chansler, he would ask them to strip and perform sexual acts while he surreptitiously recorded them, hiding his own identity by displaying sexually explicit videos in place of his own camera feed.181 Then he would threaten to upload the video to pornographic websites unless the victims emailed him  —  and as soon as they did so, he would threaten to distribute the material to friends, family, and school acquaintances unless they agreed to become what he referred to as his “cam slaves.”182 In as many as three cases, Finkbiner may have used image editing software to trick his victims into believing that he had uploaded their videos to pornographic sites.183\r\n At one point, a 17-year-old girl wrote to Finkbiner saying that she had attempted suicide the previous night and would attempt it again if he did not stop his requests.  Finkbiner wrote back, “Glad i could help.”184\r\n When one boy protested against Finkbiner’s requests, Finkbiner responded, “yes it is illegal im ok with that … i wont get caught im a hacker i covered my tracks.”185 In fact, he made no effort to hide his IP address, and the FBI was able to trace the email and Skype accounts he used for sextortion to the small Internet service company registered in his name.186\r\n Overall, Finkbiner sextorted ” “hundreds, if not thousands, of .  .  .  minors and adults all over the world,” prosecutors claimed.187 Most of the victims were minors.  He was charged with six counts of producing child pornography, 20\r\n counts of interstate extortion, eight counts of interstate transmission in aid of extortion, two counts of possessing child pornography, and seven counts of stalking.188 He pleaded guilty to all seven counts of stalking, two counts of producing child pornography, and 15 counts of extortion,189 and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.190\r\n ADAM SAVADER\r\n Adam Savader, a college student active in Republican politics, spent the summer and fall of 2012 in a prestigious position as Paul Ryan’s “sole intern” on the Romney-Ryan presidential campaign.191 But by September 2012, he had begun sextorting,192 targeting young women whom he knew from high school or college193  —  one of whom had threatened to take out a restraining order against him in the past.194 In the case of one victim who was similarlypolitically active, Savader threatened to release her photos to her mother, her sorority sisters, and the Republican National Committee.195 He would usually goad his victims into responding to him: a typical series of messages reads,\r\n “I’m about to send those pics… Should I?  If not tell me.  I’m running out of patience… Answer me now or pay.”196 Savader extorted at least 15 women in total,197 hacking into victims’ email and social media accounts in order to access sexually explicit photos stored there.  His college and hometown connections with his victims allowed him access to their accounts, as he could reset their passwords by guessing the answers to security questions that asked about information such as high school mascots and street of residence.198\r\n Once he had the photos, he would contact victims through Google Voice, a service that allows users to create a new number from which to receive and forward calls.199 Savader’s multiple Google Voice accounts allowed him to keep his cell phone number hidden from his victims, and may also have allowed him to prevent them from contacting him back in turn: Google Voice allows users to turn off call forwarding to their devices,200 and one victim’s account of her failed attempts to contact Savader is consistent with Savader’s having used this function.201 Savader used freshly created email accounts to register for the Google Voice numbers,202 but both the forwarding number for the Google Voice accounts and the IP addresses used to create those email addresses traced directly back to Savader.203\r\n Savader was sentenced to two-and-a-half years on one count of cyberstalking204 after pleading guilty to one count of cyberstalking and one count of extortion;205 he had originally been charged with four counts of each.206 While in prison, Savader has registered a Super PAC lobbying for legislation supporting improved reintegration of previously incarcerated individuals into society.  According to Savader’s father, the PAC will refrain from fundraising until his son is released from prison.207\r\n RINAT: ISRAELI CASE OF SEXTORTION\r\n The problem of sextortion is not by any means limited to the United States.  In 2013, a 30-year-old man was convicted in Israel of extortion, sexual harassment, and the publication of obscene material after posing as a female soldier on various social media sites and tricking young girls into communicating with him.  Under pressure, the communications became sexually explicit and exploitative, with the offender requesting nude photos and other pornographic material from at least three minors. \r\n In one instance, the perpetrator filmed a 13-year-old female minor without her knowledge over Skype after pressuring the girl to masturbate on camera.  The young girl eventually attempted to end the relationship with the person she knew as “Rinat,” cutting off communication with the offender.  However, the man then told her that\r\n he had recorded all of their online conversations and would publish the material if she refused to continue their relationship.  After the victim refused, the sextortionist published explicit images of the minor on Facebook.  \r\n In another instance, the perpetrator pressed a different 13-year-old minor to engage in sexual acts over Skype.  When the minor told the sextortionist that her mother was in the room, he asked and eventually convinced his victim to pretend to change her clothes in front of her webcam, so as not to attract the attention of her mother, and to allow him to see her naked.  According to the court opinion, the victim’s mother was present in the room as she was sextorted. \r\n In denying the man’s appeal against the two-year prison sentence imposed on him, the Israeli Supreme Court stated, that “the appellant’s action, absent any physical contact, does not reduce the severity of the offence.” In a chilling conclusion, the court wrote: “The thought that children are unsafe in their own home is a difficult one, and it turns out that there, in their own room in their house under the watchful eye of their parents, the appellant managed to trick them, hurt them, and cause them unimaginable harm.”208 \r\n IMPACT OF SEXTORTION ON VICTIMS\r\n The harm that many victims experience as a result of sextortion is, indeed, unimaginable.  But it is also real.  Victims of sextortion feel a justified sense of powerlessness and vulnerability: they are at the mercy of their hackers.  Victims have described descried feeling like a “slave” to the hackers during the sextortion scheme.209 Victims of these schemes spend every moment in fear of the next message demanding more compromising pictures or videos, living in perpetual anxiety of the risk of public exposure.  With every new picture sent to the hacker is the worry that it isn’t enough or that the hacker will never leave.  Related is the feeling of helplessness: the inability to reach out to others about what is going on for fear of the attacker’s retaliation.  The days, weeks, and months under the sextortionist’s control can be an absolute “nightmare,” where a victim is “trapped” and can’t “talk to anyone.”210 One teenager told investigators that the experience “felt like I was being virtually raped.”211\r\n The traumatic effects on child victims can be particularly severe.  Younger victims are sometimes paralyzed by the potential social repercussions of sextortion.  One victim recounted that, as a young teenager, she was “already getting teased in middle school” and was terrified she might lose friends and become a target of cruel teenage bullying if her classmates found out what was going on.212 The nature of sextortion also makes for easy victim-blaming: the\r\n victims, after all, took pictures and videos of themselves and sent them along.  Why didn’t they just refuse to go along with the scheme? \r\n Martha Finnegan, an FBI expert in child forensics explains that this kind of psychological cruelty  —  forcing the victim to participate in the production of these images  —  can have “a devastating emotional effect” on the victims:\r\n [T]hat’s what society doesn’t get: Yes, the girls participated in this.  But they’re children; they’re still very much victims.  Even though they haven’t been touched, the trauma level we see is as severe as hands-on offenses, because a lot of these kids don’t know how to end what can go on, sometimes, for years.  … And they think it’s not happening to anyone else.213\r\n Children are often the easiest targets of these sorts of crimes not only because of their social vulnerability, but because they often do not realize that what is happening is criminal behavior.  They are often left defenseless and too scared to admit to their parents or to anyone else what is happening.  They also sometimes have no idea when threats are completely idle ones.  One young sextortion victim complied with demands for nude photos because her attacker threatened to “blow up” her computer if she did not, and the computer was a treasured new Christmas present.214 That defenselessness does not cease even in when the hacking is over and the sextortionist is prosecuted.  One of Luis Mijangos’ victims described the visceral fear of her hacker that has stayed with her since, despite Mijangos’ prosecution and ultimate jail time: “He [still] haunts me every time I use the computer.”215 Another one of Mijangos’ victims explained that moving away from the Los Angeles area has not made her feel any safer: as long as he had an Internet connection, Mijangos was able to attack from anywhere, at any time.  This is a crime from which some victims have a great deal of trouble escaping.  They carry the weight of this anxiety and distrust with them. \r\n To make these points tangible, consider some of the victim impacts from the case studies in the previous section.  In sentencing Abrahams, for example, the judge declared:\r\n Through his computer skills, he hacked into girls’ computers and observed them in their bedrooms dressing and undressing through cameras, or webcams, on the computers.  He hacked their e-mail and social media accounts, and by his own assessment attempted to make them his “slaves.” The intimidation turned to extortion when he demanded that they perform certain acts before the computer camera or face posting of their images on the internet.  He did in fact post images.  And as one of the victims noted, she will never know for rest of her life when those images will resurface on the internet.216\r\n In the Chansler case, impact statements for five victims and their family members were introduced at sentencing. \r\n One victim described herself as becoming a “hollow shell” under the onslaught of Chansler’s demands, plagued by panic attacks.217 The mother of another victim explained that her daughter now becomes uncomfortable whenever she steps out onto the street, constantly wondering if any passersby have seen her naked.218 An FBI special agent\r\n assigned to the case described the situation of one young girl who was forced to leave school and move hundreds of miles away out of fear for her life, returning home only when she learned from FBI agents that Chansler had been arrested.219\r\n Impact statements submitted in the Savader case make clear how an ever-present stream of threats can lead to victims’ psychological exhaustion.  One woman characterized the experience as an unending “barrage of harassment,”\r\n leading to a “feeling of helplessness [that] consumed almost every aspect of my life.”220 Another described the extensive reach of Savader’s sextortion:\r\n The harassment invaded every part of my life.  There were times when I needed to completely turn my phone off to avoid receiving continuous harassment almost every minute.  There was no way to block the messages because the numbers were constantly changing.  I received messages on my cell phone while at home in Pennsylvania, in the classroom in D.C., and even on vacation with my family in Florida.  The fake Facebook account then began contacting my mother, stepfather, brother, boyfriend, and best friend.  The fake account sent messages to my family seeking further pictures of me.  At this point, everyone in both my boyfriend’s family\r\n and mine were involved.  When the texts would not stop, I was forced to contact my cell phone provider and change my cell phone number.221\r\n The sentencing transcript in the Ivory Dickerson case and the government’s sentencing memorandum in the Finkbiner case makes for particularly ugly reading.  In Dickerson’s case, one victim reported that she became “afraid to go to school … afraid to walk outside” for fear that she would meet her tormenter.222 The parents of a second victim testified that they constantly feared for their daughter’s life: “we had no idea what would happen when she went to the school, to the store, to anywhere.”223 The atmosphere of fear in the family was such that this second victim’s younger brother began to worry that Dickerson would come and hurt him in his sleep.224\r\n In Finkbiner, the government did not introduce victim impact statements.  It did, however, lay out what Finkbiner made some of his victims do.  In addition, as we noted above, to driving one girl to a suicide attempt, he forced children to engage in all sorts of highly-degrading sexual activity.  The following is an almost random sample: C. Finkbiner’s Victimization of John Doe 2 (Count 2 of the First Information)\r\n At the time of Finkbiner’s offense against him, John Doe 2 was a 14-year-old boy located in Sissonville, West Virginia.  During a March 10, 2011, video chat session, Finkbiner demanded that John Doe 2 model a jock strap, dance naked, do sit-ups, masturbate and eat his ejaculate, and penetrate his anus with a finger.  John Doe 2 complied with Finkbiner’s demands, which Finkbiner recorded on video.  During a March 14, 2011, video chat session, Finkbiner demanded that John Doe 2 wear short shorts, strip naked, dance, masturbate, wear a wet t-shirt and jock strap, dance, strip again, do sit-ups and simulate sex with a pillow.  John Doe 2 again complied with Finkbiner’s demands, which Finkbiner recorded on video. \r\n"

During a May 10, 2011, chat session, Finkbiner recorded a video of John Doe 3 masturbating. \r\n During another video chat session about an hour later, John Doe 3 initially refused to show Finkbiner his face on camera.  Finkbiner stated that he knew John Doe 3 lived in Dubuque, Iowa, and threatened to send the video to named individuals and teachers who knew John Doe 3, and a named high school.  John Doe 3 then agreed to comply with Finkbiner’s demands.  During this chat session, Finkbiner demanded that John Doe 3 strip, dance, masturbate, and show Finkbiner his anus.

During a May 12, 2011, video chat session, Finkbiner recorded a video of John Doe 4 masturbating. \r\n During another video chat session about 20 minutes later, Finkbiner demanded that John Doe 4 be his “cam slave” and engage in additional sexually explicit conduct on video.  John Doe 4 initially refused to comply.  Finkbiner threatened to send the video to individuals and teachers who knew John Doe 4, naming the individuals and a high school.  John Doe 4 then agreed to comply with Finkbiner’s demands.  Finkbiner demanded\r\n that John Doe 4 dance like “a stripper,” masturbate, and show Finkbiner his anus.  Finkbiner demanded that John Doe 4 play with his nipples, then lay in bed and masturbate.  Finkbiner then told John Doe 4 to ejaculate into his hand, lick up his ejaculate and show his mouth full of ejaculate to Finkbiner on camera.  John Doe 4 complied with Finkbiner’s demands, which Finkbiner recorded on video.  Finkbiner then told John Doe 4 to contact him again the next day.  John Doe 4 pleaded with Finkbiner not to have to engage in any more activity on camera.  Finkbiner stated “complain and ill fukk u over,” “depends on u.” John Doe 4 then asked Finkbiner to just get it all done at that time, Finkbiner stated “ull be fine dgo do ur\r\n hw or somthing.” John Doe 4 continued to plead with Finkbiner, stating “no please im scared i dont wanna worry about this please.” Finkbiner did not respond further to John Doe 4.225 CONCLUSION\r\n The discussion above suggests a number of important policy and social interventions.  Our purpose in this paper is largely to describe a serious problem of whose existence many people are unaware.  But to describe this problem is also to notice serious deficiencies in the way we are addressing the matter as a society.  The following are several recommendations aimed at different levels of society:\r\n RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LAWMAKERS\r\n The law currently contains two startling deficiencies that lead to serious sentencing disparities in sextortion cases.  The first is the absence of any parallel in cases involving adult victims for the severe sentencing associated with federal child pornography prosecutions.  The disparity is understandable as an original matter: adult pornography is, as a general matter, constitutionally protected speech and expression, whereas the federal government has an\r\n abiding interest in protecting children against exploitation in fashions that implicate federal jurisdiction.  In this context, however, as we have explained, the disparate treatment of adults and children results in a gross under-protection of adult women relative to children of either gender in the interstate coerced production of pornography.  Exacerbating this problem is the relative weakness of many state laws.  Some serious sextortion cases we reviewed were prosecuted at the state level as misdemeanors.  Prosecutors and investigators\r\n should operate on the presumption that sextortion is taking place everywhere and should devote human resources to investigating and prosecuting sextortion cases as\r\n part of their broader focus on child exploitation.  \r\n Recommendation #1: Given that these cases are numerous, many are interstate in nature, and most being prosecuted federally anyway, Congress should consider adopting a federal sextortion statute that addresses the specific conduct at issue in sextortion cases and does not treat the age of the victim as a core element of the offense.  Specifically, as we lay out in greater depth in a separate paper, “Closing the Sextortion Sentencing Gap,” we believe this statute should combine elements of the federal interstate extortion statute with elements of the\r\n aggravated sexual abuse statute and have sentencing that parallels physical-world sexual assaults.  Recommendation #2: State lawmakers should likewise adopt strong statutes with criminal penalties commensurate with the harm sextortion cases do.  More broadly, states should carefully review their statutes relative to the productionn\r\n Prosecutors and investigators\r\n should operate on the presumption that sextortion is taking place everywhere and should devote human resources to investigating and prosecuting sextortion cases as part of their broader focus on child exploitation. \r\n Sextortion: Cybersecurity, teenagers, and remote sexual assault 27 and distribution of non-consensual pornography.  Many states have no such laws.  Others have laws of inadequate\r\n force.  In our view, states should both criminalize the production and distribution of nonconsensual pornography and give victims of it reasonable civil remedies against their victimizers.  In combination with a federal statute, this would create a number of avenues for victims to pursue.  \r\n RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FEDERAL AUTHORITIES\r\n Short of the adoption of new legislation, there are important steps available to the Justice Department and the FBI to take administratively.  One striking feature of the sextortion problem is that nobody knows how widespread or serious it is, because nobody publishes good data on sextortion cases at either the state or federal levels.  The failure to lack of readily available data takes place even as the FBI has repeatedly warned of the problem and even as the Justice Department has announced Project Safe Childhood, which the department describes as “a Department of Justice initiative launched in 2006 to combat the proliferation of technology-facilitated crimes involving the sexual exploitation of children.”226 A number of Justice Department press releases in sextortion cases describe the prosecutions in question as taking place under the Project Safe Childhood umbrella.  It is striking that even the project under which sextortion prosecutions take place cannot readily identify or count them. \r\n Moreover, the federal system is notably uneven in its focus on sextortion cases.  We think it unlikely that four of our cases come each from such jurisdictions as the Central District of California, the Middle District of Florida, and the Northern District of Georgia because these jurisdictions are particularly rife with sextortionists.  We suspect, moreover, that the reason three of our cases come from state court in Wisconsin has more to do with the attention\r\n in that state of a single local prosecutor named Erin Karshen  —  who cares about the issue  —  than with the prevalence of the offense in Milwaukee.  We also suspect that the apparent absence of cases (at least in our dataset) from such powerhouse prosecutorial districts as the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York does not reflect the fact that New York City is a sextortion-free zone. \r\n Recommendation #3: The federal government should develop and maintain robust data on federal prosecutions of sextortion and other cases involving the non-consensual production of pornography and cyberstalking.  It should not wait to do so until Congress passes statutes specifically criminalizing sextortion.  The conduct is all already covered by federal statutes; it is mostly prosecuted, as we have seen, in federal court.  Having access to good data on federal\r\n handling of these cases is critical both to raising awareness of the problem and to developing more refined statutory tools for addressing it. \r\n Recommendation #4: U.S.  Attorneys and FBI Special Agents in Charge in jurisdictions which have not seen these cases should not conclude that they are not taking place but that they have probably overlooked them.  Prosecutors and investigators should operate on the presumption that sextortion is taking place everywhere and should devote human resources to investigating and prosecuting sextortion cases as part of their broader focus on child exploitation.  Recommendation #5: They should also adopt as policy what is already de facto practice: Federal authorities, being both better positioned for interstate and international investigations than state or local authorities and having the stronger laws and penalties, should presume  —  in contrast to many other sex crimes cases  —  that they are an investigative\r\n and prosecutorial front line.  Unlike physical sexual assaults, which are presumptively local in nature, sextortions take place in a domain that is generally non-local and often requires complex interjurisdictional machinations and technical forensics.  These cases are, much of the time, best handled at the federal level.  \r\n RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND INTERNET COMPANIES\r\n Webcams are a great innovation for human connectivity.  They are also often insecure and offer sextortionists and other bad cyber actors literal visibility into the activity of non-consenting targets.  Similarly, relatively lax password controls  —  and relatively simple password recovery  —  on social media platforms makes hacking accounts too easy.  \r\n Recommendation #6: Hardware manufacturers should build into computers easy slip-over webcam masks that allow users to physically cover their computers’ camera when it is not in use.  More generally, hardware manufacturers should consider whether the security risks of software-driven webcams exceed the convenience benefits and whether a physical switch disabling webcams should be the preferred norm.  By one means or another, computer\r\n manufacturers should make it convenient and easy to physically disable when not in use those hardware devices that hackers can use to turn computers into surveillance devices. \r\n Recommendation #7: Account hacking would be far more difficult if Internet and social media companies required the use of strong passwords and made those passwords recoverable based on criteria other than data hometown stalkers know well or can guess easily.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND VICTIMS\r\n One of the factors that makes sextortion cases, particularly those involving child victims, difficult to uncover is the intergenerational gap in sexual mores concerning online activities.  Teenagers often send nude pictures of themselves to one another.  Their parents find this shocking.  And this gap in attitude inhibits communication between generations when what a teenager may regard as innocent sexting suddenly turns very ugly.  Yet one of the features of these cases that jumps out at even a casual reader is how much better those victims who have an adult to turn to fare than those who are too humiliated to tell a parent or a teacher what is happening to them.  Parents are better positioned to activate law enforcement than are children.  And every sextortionist who gets caught has one thing in common: a victim who talked to someone that victim decided to trust.  This observation has important process implications. \r\n Recommendation #8: It is critically important for parents and teachers to establish with their children a no-judgment, no-questions reporting regime for sexual exploitation online.  Children need to understand that there are ways out of the traps the sextortionists have them in.  And responsible adults need to create mechanisms the children they are responsible for feel safe using when they are threatened.  Finally, there is one critical recommendation with respect to victims of sextortion, both those currently subject to it and those who have been victimized in this past. \r\n Recommendation #9: Victims need to be enabled to come forward and, to the extent they wish, speak up.  Current victims of sextortion may or may not understand that the person victimizing them may also be doing the same thing to literally hundreds of other people and will not stop until someone gets law enforcement involved.  Past victims have a role to play in making current victims understand that they are experiencing something that is both common and  not their fault.  Yet it can be extremely difficult for victims to come forward, especially in the absence of assurances that the law will protect them and that law enforcement will treat them with respect and dignity.  In this context, it is especially troubling that child pornography laws in many jurisdictions have been used to punish minors for creating images of themselves  —  a reality that means that minor victims potentially put themselves in legal jeopardy by coming forward.  Only by making it possible to talk about sextortion will society lessen the power of those who engage in it."

        "text":" There were two almanacs of the Rich Party on the walls.  It was surprisingly crowded for that time of the afternoon.  There were normal, decent-looking people, as well as men with scars, women with bracelets that weighed down their arms, men with dark glasses.  Arguments reverberated in the heated place.  They discussed politics and scandals in loud, passionate voices.  Some of them had thunderous faces, gleaming with sweat, and when they talked their mouths opened to astonishing degrees.  Some of them were thin and bony, with ragged hungry beards and furtive eyes.  The women had long painted fingers.  They waved their hands violently when they spoke.  They fanned themselves with newspapers Their noises mingled with the incessant buzz of the flies.\r\n\r\n There was a hammer on the counter.  I thought the carpenter was around, but upon looking, I found he wasn’t.  There were several gourds of palm-wine on the tables, and flies jostled on their rims.  The plates empty of peppersoup were also a little busy with the flies.  At one corner of the room a man lay on the bench, his mouth and eyes open.  He was fast asleep.  A wall-gecko ran across his face and got caught in his hair and he woke up screaming.  The others burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n In the midst of all the noise sat a man with a chief’s cap on his head.  He sat straight, with inherited dignity, and there was a boy next to him who fanned him.  He had great orange beads round his neck and wore a dazzling blue agbada.  He drank as if he owned the place.  He looked familiar.  I looked hard at him.  Then I remembered him as oneof themen on thevanwhohadbeenoverseeingthedistributionofpoisonedmilk.  His lips were large for his face and the colour of his lower lip was a curious mixture of red and black.  There was more red than black and it seemed he had been burnt thereas achild.  Hehad theeyes of arat.  Hecaught mestaringat him.\r\n\r\n ‘What areyou lookingat?’  heasked.  Thevoices in thebar stopped.\r\n\r\n ‘You,’ I said.\r\n\r\n ‘Why?  Are you mad?’\r\n\r\n ‘No.’\r\n\r\n He gave me a vicious stare.  One of the men in the bar got up, came over, and cracked me on the head.\r\n\r\n ‘You are mad,’ he said.\r\n\r\n I spat at him, but it didn’t travel very far.\r\n\r\n ‘Look at this bad boy,’ he said, and cracked me a second time.\r\n\r\n I spat again.  It landed on my shirt.  Madame Koto came into the bar.  The man slapped me with two thick fingers and I shouted and rushed for the hammer on the counter.  I tore at the man, who for some reason fled.  Madame Koto grabbed my arms and took the hammer from me.\r\n\r\n ‘Don’t be a bad boy!  Do you see that man there?’  she said, pointing.  ‘He’s a chief.  Heis goingto ruleour area.  Hewillswallow you.’\r\n\r\n The chief, satisfied with the tribute, smiled, and went on drinking.  The noises resumed.  Some of the people commented on my behaviour and lamented the way children no longer respected their elders and blamed it all on the white man’s way of lifewhich was spoilingthevalues of Africa.\r\n\r\n Then one of the men suggested to Madame Koto that she would be better off with girls as waiters and servants than with boys.  A woman amongst them said that if Madame Koto wanted some girls to work for her, and to help her serve the customers, she could arrange it.\r\n\r\n ‘That ugly boy will destroy your business for you,’ said the man who had knocked me twice on the head.  ‘Who wants to be drunk on your excellent palm-wine and see that terrible face?’\r\n\r\n ‘You will die!’  I said to the man.\r\n\r\n The voices stopped.  The man rose from his bench, his face quivering under the superstitious fear of a child’s curse.\r\n\r\n ‘Say I won’t die!’  he demanded.\r\n\r\n ‘No!’\r\n\r\n He came towards me.  Madame Koto was counting money behind her counter.  She was too engrossed to be aware of what was happening.\r\n\r\n ‘Take it back!’\r\n\r\n ‘No!’\r\n\r\n He strode towards me.  Only the flies made any noises.\r\n\r\n ‘Floghimtillhepisses on himself,’ said thechief.  ‘That’s how to train achild.’\r\n\r\n I watched the man without moving.  He raised his hand to hit me and I ran neatly between his legs and everyone laughed.  I stopped and made faces at the chief and the painted women.  When the man dashed at me, enraged by the trick, I fled out of the bar and went on fleeing and didn’t stop till I was in the forest.  I looked back.  The man was panting.  He gave up and turned back.  I went deeper into the forest and sat on the mighty tree that had been cut down.  I looked over the great pit from which they had been dredging sand to build the roads of the world.\r\n\r\n And then I wandered.  I wandered for a long time in the forest.  The earth gave off a potent aroma and in the heat the palm trees released alcoholic fumes deep in their trunks which I breathed in with the smell of their barks and their wine-sap evaporating into the quivering air.  I listened to the curlews in the groves of wild pine trees.  Intoxicated with the alcoholic fumes of sun on earth I broke through a remote section of the forest, where sunbirds clustered in baobab branches, and I emerged in another reality, a strange world, a path which had completed its transition into a road.  The surface of the road was uneven with bumps.  The tarmac melted under the sun and my soles turned black.  The smell of melting tarmac was heady and I saw the mirage of a trailer, quivering in its frightening speed, coursing down the road towards me.  The mirage shot right through the road construction machines that stood at the intersection.  It ground its way over the women who sold iced water and oranges, over the beggars and the workers and shacks within which the eternal arguments about pay and strikes raged.  And then the great mirage of the trailer went on, plungingforward, right into the forest and I did not see it any more.\r\n\r\n I came to another half-constructed road.  Workers stood around the hulks of machinery, abusing those who were working.  They waved sticks with words written on them.  I gathered that those who cursed had been sacked.  They shouted slogans at the white engineers.  I did not see any white engineers.  It might have been the sun.  I passed them and when I looked back I saw figures setting upon the protesting workers.  The sun was remorseless.  Shadows were deep.  Where the sun was brightest, objects were blackest.  Antagonists and protesters twisted in an extraordinary dance and all I could make out were the confusing shapes of glistening bodies moving in and out of visibility.  Thelights madeeverythingunreal.\r\n\r\n Birds cawed overhead, flying around in widening circles.  I reentered the forest.  The sun’s rays were sharp like glass.  The blue shadows of green trees blinded me for a moment.  The shade was cooling and the air smelt of fine aromatic herbs and bark.  Patterns of light and colours danced on the forest floor.  Flowers which I didn’t see scented the dense and tender breeze.  I listened to the fluted sound of birds, the murmurings of a distant stream, the wind in the somnolent trees, and the pervasive concert of insects.  And then, suddenly, that part of the forest was over.\r\n\r\n I had emerged into another world.  All around, in the future present, a mirage of houses was being built, paths and roads crossed and surrounded the forest in tightening circles, unpainted churches and the whitewashed walls of mosques sprang up where the forest was thickest.  The worshippers in the unpainted churches wore whitecassocks and prayed totheringingofbellsallafternoon.Theworldoftreesand wild bushes was being thinned.  I heard the ghostly wood-cutters axing down the titanic irokos, the giant baobabs, the rubber trees and obeches.  There were birds’ nests on the earth and the eggs within them were smashed, had fallen out, had mingled with the leaves and the dust, the little birds within the cracked eggs half-formed and dried up, dying as they were emerging into a hard, miraculous world.  Ants swarmed all over them.\r\n\r\n At intervals I passed people who were sitting behind trees.  When I looked back they were no longer there.  Nude women appeared and vanished before my gaze.  The smell of earth, leaves, sun, and the merest hint of dried excrement overpowered my senses.  I wandered deeper into the world of trees, amongst the solitude of acacias and needlepines, andsawpeopleclearingthebushes,uprootingtreestumps,rakinggreatclusters of climbers and dried mistletoes into heaps.  I saw old bicycles restingon trees.  I saw men and women burning the bushes, the clusters of climbers and vines, and there must havebeenecstaticherbsamongstwhatwasbeingburntforthesmokeyieldedup voluminous aromas of sage and rosemary, dried leaves and densities of green and yellow fumes and all manner of secret potencies and powerful crackling smells into the air.\r\n\r\n And the smoke and the smells were dense everywhere and it was impossible not to breathe them in and the mysteries of burning plants in the deep forest charged my head and I went around stumbling into trees, tripping over roots, walking up against the ochre palaces that were anthills, or wandering round in circles, or watching bicycles riding around among the trees without riders, or noticing women pedalling the air without anything beneath them.  Anthills which I had passed followed me.  I became certain that the whole forest was moving.\r\n\r\n The trees were running away from human habitation.  My eyes became charged too and I saw people with serene bronze masks emerging from trees.  I saw a bird with a man’s hairy legs flying clumsily over the branches of the rain-tree.  An antelope with the face of a chaste woman stopped and stared at me and when I moved it disappeared among the luxuriant bushes.  An old man emerged from the anthill that had been following me.  He had a white beard and green bejewelled eyes and a face that was both a hundred years old and childlike.  His hands were up in the air, his neck slightly bent, as if he were carrying the heaviest riddle in the world.  He seemed to follow me wherever I went.  He had a staff which was the flowering branch of an orange tree and he hobbled slowly and came after me with inscrutable persistence.  When I became aware of how intent he was I ran, but no matter how fast I fled he remained the same distance from me.  I became confused and afraid.  I tripped over a skull and hurt my ankle and couldn’t move.  I waited.  I heard no footsteps, but the old man kept on at me, neither catching up with me, nor retreating.  He remained at the same distance, bearing the great weight of an invisible enigma on his head.\r\n\r\n The forest was full of mirages from which I could not escape. "

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal patterns, a form of biofeedback, differ with level of expertise in shooting due to the level of focused attention and posture exhibited by variously skilled shooters.  This project studies how to optimize focused attention in expert rifle shooters, with the use of neurocognitive tools, to enhance shooting performance.  The specific aims of this study are to (i) develop neurocognitive tools to train focused attention in shooters, (ii) correlate EEG data with shooting performance (i.e.  “good” shot vs. “bad” shot), pre and post neurofeedback training and (iii) propose strategies for shooters to increase and maintain their level of focused attention during training and competition.  We developed Electroencephalogram (EEG) based tools that allow recognizing mental workload of shooters during the task performance.  The mental workload is defined as mental efforts needed to perform the task.  In our preliminary study, a total of 6 shooters took part in the experiment, 3 male and 3 female.  3 were pistol shooters and 3 were rifle shooters – all participants used their own equipment which they were accustomed to and were familiar with the range and surroundings.  During the experiment, participants’ real-time brain activity was recorded via the Emotiv Epoc EEG device, with the pre-shot phase of each of the 40 shots to be analyzed against the shooting performance.  The EEG data were processed using 4 sec sliding window.  The preliminary analyses have shown negative correlation of mental workload calculated right before the shot with shooting performance in the experienced shooters, and positive correlation in the novice shooters.  This confirms hypotheses that experience shooters have better shots with lower mental workload that may also involve the optimal posture.  It was found that alpha power is positively correlated with shooting performance.  This initially confirms the hypotheses that alpha-based neurofeedback training can be used to train focused attention in shooters"
