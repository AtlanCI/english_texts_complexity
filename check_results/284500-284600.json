The coach is outside.\"\r\n\r\n \"Come on, people,\" said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling.  \"Bob, you'll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'll try to,\" said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie.  \"You won't need much watching, will you?\"  he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way.\r\n\r\n \"Not very, I hope,\" said Carrie.\r\n\r\n They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into the open coach.\r\n\r\n \"All right,\" said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance rolled away.\r\n\r\n \"What is it we're going to see?\"  asked Ames.\r\n\r\n \"Sothern,\" said Vance, \"in 'Lord Chumley.'\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, he is so good!\"  said Mrs. Vance.  \"He's just the funniest man.\"\r\n\r\n \"I notice the papers praise it,\" said Ames.\r\n\r\n \"I haven't any doubt,\" put in Vance, \"but we'll all enjoy it very much.\"\r\n\r\n Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention.  He was interested to find her so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful interest.  There was nothing of the dashing lady's man about him.  He had respect for the married state, and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in Indianapolis.\r\n\r\n \"Are you a born New Yorker?\"  asked Ames of Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, no;  I've only been here for two years.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, well, you've had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't seem to have,\" answered Carrie.  \"It's about as strange to me as when I first came here.\"\r\n\r\n \"You're not from the West, are you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes.  I'm from Wisconsin,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n \"Well, it does seem as if most people in this town haven't been here so very long.  I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are here.\"\r\n\r\n \"What is your line?\"  asked Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"I'm connected with an electrical company,\" said the youth.\r\n\r\n Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional interruptions from the Vances.  Several times it became general and partially humorous, and in that manner the restaurant was reached.\r\n\r\n Carrie had noticed the appearance of gayety and pleasure-seeking in the streets which they were following.  Coaches were numerous, pedestrians many, and in Fifty-ninth Street the street cars were crowded.  At Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth Avenue a blaze of lights from several new hotels which bordered the Plaza Square gave a suggestion of sumptuous hotel life.  Fifth Avenue, the home of the wealthy, was noticeably crowded with carriages, and gentlemen in evening dress.  At Sherry's an imposing doorman opened the coach door and helped them out.  Young Ames held Carrie's elbow as he helped her up the steps.  They entered the lobby already swarming with patrons, and then, after divesting themselves of their wraps, went into a sumptuous dining-room.\r\n\r\n In all Carrie's experience she had never seen anything like this.  In the whole time she had been in New York Hurstwood's modified state had not permitted his bringing her to such a place.  There was an almost indescribable atmosphere about it which convinced the newcomer that this was the proper thing.  Here was the place where the matter of expense limited the patrons to the moneyed or pleasure-loving class.  Carrie had read of it often in the \"Morning\" and \"Evening World.\"  She had seen notices of dances, parties, balls, and suppers at Sherry's.  The Misses So-and-so would give a party on Wednesday evening at Sherry's.  Young Mr. So-and-So would entertain a party of friends at a private luncheon on the sixteenth, at Sherry's.  The common run of conventional, perfunctory notices of the doings of society, which she could scarcely refrain from scanning each day, had given her a distinct idea of the gorgeousness and luxury of this wonderful temple of gastronomy.  Now, at last, she was really in it.  She had come up the imposing steps, guarded by the large and portly doorman.  She had seen the lobby, guarded by another large and portly gentleman, and been waited upon by uniformed youths who took care of canes, overcoats, and the like.  Here was the splendid dining-chamber, all decorated and aglow, where the wealthy ate.  Ah, how fortunate was Mrs. Vance;  young, beautiful, and well off—at least, sufficiently so to come here in a coach.  What a wonderful thing it was to be rich.\r\n\r\n Vance led the way through lanes of shining tables, at which were seated parties of two, three, four, five, or six.  The air of assurance and dignity about it all was exceedingly noticeable to the novitiate.  Incandescent lights, the reflection of their glow in polished glasses, and the shine of gilt upon the walls, combined into one tone of light which it requires minutes of complacent observation to separate and take particular note of.  The white shirt fronts of the gentlemen, the bright costumes of the ladies, diamonds, jewels, fine feathers—all were exceedingly noticeable.\r\n\r\n Carrie walked with an air equal to that of Mrs. Vance, and accepted the seat which the head waiter provided for her.  She was keenly aware of all the little things that were done—the little genuflections and attentions of the waiters and head waiter which Americans pay for.  The air with which the latter pulled out each chair, and the wave of the hand with which he motioned them to be seated, were worth several dollars in themselves.\r\n\r\n Once seated, there began that exhibition of showy, wasteful, and unwholesome gastronomy as practised by wealthy Americans, which is the wonder and astonishment of true culture and dignity the world over.  The large bill of fare held an array of dishes sufficient to feed an army, sidelined with prices which made reasonable expenditure a ridiculous impossibility—an order of soup at fifty cents or a dollar, with a dozen kinds to choose from;  oysters in forty styles and at sixty cents the half-dozen;  entrees, fish, and meats at prices which would house one over night in an average hotel.  One dollar fifty and two dollars seemed to be the most common figures upon this most tastefully printed bill of fare.\r\n\r\n Carrie noticed this, and in scanning it the price of spring chicken carried her back to that other bill of fare and far different occasion when, for the first time, she sat with Drouet in a good restaurant in Chicago.  It was only momentary—a sad note as out of an old song—and then it was gone.  But in that flash was seen the other Carrie—poor, hungry, drifting at her wits' ends, and all Chicago a cold and closed world, from which she only wandered because she could not find work.\r\n\r\n On the walls were designs in colour, square spots of robin's-egg blue, set in ornate frames of gilt, whose corners were elaborate mouldings of fruit and flowers, with fat cupids hovering in angelic comfort.  On the ceilings were coloured traceries with more gilt, leading to a centre where spread a cluster of lights— incandescent globes mingled with glittering prisms and stucco tendrils of gilt.  The floor was of a reddish hue, waxed and polished, and in every direction were mirrors—tall, brilliant, bevel-edged mirrors—reflecting and re-reflecting forms, faces, and candelabra a score and a hundred times.\r\n\r\n The tables were not so remarkable in themselves, and yet the imprint of Sherry upon the napery, the name of Tiffany upon the silverware, the name of Haviland upon the china, and over all the glow of the small, red-shaded candelabra and the reflected tints of the walls on garments and faces, made them seem remarkable.  Each waiter added an air of exclusiveness and elegance by the manner in which he bowed, scraped, touched, and trifled with things.  The exclusively personal attention which he devoted to each one, standing half bent, ear to one side, elbows akimbo, saying: \"Soup—green turtle, yes.  One portion, yes.  Oysters— certainly—half-dozen—yes.  Asparagus.  Olives—yes.\"\r\n\r\n It would be the same with each one, only Vance essayed to order for all, inviting counsel and suggestions.  Carrie studied the company with open eyes.  So this was high life in New York.  It was so that the rich spent their days and evenings.  Her poor little mind could not rise above applying each scene to all society.  Every fine lady must be in the crowd on Broadway in the afternoon, in the theatre at the matinee, in the coaches and dining-halls at night.  It must be glow and shine everywhere, with coaches waiting, and footmen attending, and she was out of it all.  In two long years she had never even been in such a place as this.\r\n\r\n Vance was in his element here, as Hurstwood would have been in former days.  He ordered freely of soup, oysters, roast meats, and side dishes, and had several bottles of wine brought, which were set down beside the table in a wicker basket.\r\n\r\n Ames was looking away rather abstractedly at the crowd and showed an interesting profile to Carrie.  His forehead was high, his nose rather large and strong, his chin moderately pleasing.  He had a good, wide, well-shaped mouth, and his dark-brown hair was parted slightly on one side.  He seemed to have the least touch of boyishness to Carrie, and yet he was a man full grown.\r\n\r\n \"Do you know,\" he said, turning back to Carrie, after his reflection, \"I sometimes think it is a shame for people to spend so much money this way.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surprise at his seriousness.  He seemed to be thinking about something over which she had never pondered.\r\n\r\n \"Do you?\"  she answered, interestedly.\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" he said, \"they pay so much more than these things are worth.  They put on so much show.\"\r\n\r\n \"I don't know why people shouldn't spend when they have it,\" said Mrs. Vance.\r\n\r\n \"It doesn't do any harm,\" said Vance, who was still studying the bill of fare, though he had ordered.\r\n\r\n Ames was looking away again, and Carrie was again looking at his forehead.  To her he seemed to be thinking about strange things.  As he studied the crowd his eye was mild.\r\n\r\n \"Look at that woman's dress over there,\" he said, again turning to Carrie, and nodding in a direction.\r\n\r\n \"Where?\"  said Carrie, following his eyes.\r\n\r\n \"Over there in the corner—way over.  Do you see that brooch?\"\r\n\r\n \"Isn't it large?\"  said Carrie.\r\n\r\n \"One of the largest clusters of jewels I have ever seen,\" said Ames.\r\n\r\n \"It is, isn't it?\"  said Carrie.  She felt as if she would like to be agreeable to this young man, and also there came with it, or perhaps preceded it, the slightest shade of a feeling that he was better educated than she was—that his mind was better.  He seemed to look it, and the saving grace in Carrie was that she could understand that people could be wiser.  She had seen a number of people in her life who reminded her of what she had vaguely come to think of as scholars.  This strong young man beside her, with his clear, natural look, seemed to get a hold of things which she did not quite understand, but approved of.  It was fine to be so, as a man, she thought.\r\n\r\n The conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue at the time—\"Moulding a Maiden,\" by Albert Ross.  Mrs. Vance had read it.  Vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers.\r\n\r\n \"A man can make quite a strike writing a book,\" said Vance.  \"I notice this fellow Ross is very much talked about.\"  He was looking at Carrie as he spoke.\r\n\r\n \"I hadn't heard of him,\" said Carrie, honestly.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, I have,\" said Mrs. Vance.  \"He's written lots of things.  This last story is pretty good.\"\r\n\r\n \"He doesn't amount to much,\" said Ames.\r\n\r\n Carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle.\r\n\r\n \"His stuff is nearly as bad as 'Dora Thorne,'\" concluded Ames.\r\n\r\n Carrie felt this as a personal reproof.  She read \"Dora Thorne,\" or had a great deal in the past.  It seemed only fair to her, but she supposed that people thought it very fine.  Now this clear- eyed, fine-headed youth, who looked something like a student to her, made fun of it.  It was poor to him, not worth reading.  She looked down, and for the first time felt the pain of not understanding.\r\n\r\n Yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way Ames spoke.  He had very little of that in him.  Carrie felt that it was just kindly thought of a high order—the right thing to think, and wondered what else was right, according to him.  He seemed to notice that she listened and rather sympathised with him, and from now on he talked mostly to her.\r\n\r\n As the waiter bowed and scraped about, felt the dishes to see if they were hot enough, brought spoons and forks, and did all those little attentive things calculated to impress the luxury of the situation upon the diner, Ames also leaned slightly to one side and told her of Indianapolis in an intelligent way.  He really had a very bright mind, which was finding its chief development in electrical knowledge.  His sympathies for other forms of information, however, and for types of people, were quick and warm.  The red glow on his head gave it a sandy tinge and put a bright glint in his eye.  Carrie noticed all these things as he leaned toward her and felt exceedingly young.  This man was far ahead of her.  He seemed wiser than Hurstwood, saner and brighter than Drouet.  He seemed innocent and clean, and she thought that he was exceedingly pleasant.  She noticed, also, that his interest in her was a far-off one.  She was not in his life, nor any of the things that touched his life, and yet now, as he spoke of these things, they appealed to her.\r\n\r\n \"I shouldn't care to be rich,\" he told her, as the dinner proceeded and the supply of food warmed up his sympathies;  \"not rich enough to spend my money this way.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, wouldn't you?\"  said Carrie, the, to her, new attitude forcing itself distinctly upon her for the first time.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he said.  \"What good would it do?  A man doesn't need this sort of thing to be happy.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie thought of this doubtfully;  but, coming from him, it had weight with her.\r\n\r\n \"He probably could be happy,\" she thought to herself, \"all alone.  He's so strong.\"\r\n\r\n Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, and these impressive things by Ames came at odd moments.  They were sufficient, however, for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself upon Carrie without words.  There was something in him, or the world he moved in, which appealed to her.  He reminded her of scenes she had seen on the stage—the sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she knew not what.  He had taken away some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life and her life, and all by a certain calm indifference which concerned only him.\r\n\r\n As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach, and then they were off again, and so to the show.\r\n\r\n During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him very attentively.  He mentioned things in the play which she most approved of—things which swayed her deeply.\r\n\r\n \"Don't you think it rather fine to be an actor?\"  she asked once.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, I do,\" he said, \"to be a good one.  I think the theatre a great thing.\"\r\n\r\n Just this little approval set Carrie's heart bounding.  Ah, if she could only be an actress—a good one!  This man was wise—he knew—and he approved of it.  If she were a fine actress, such men as he would approve of her.  She felt that he was good to speak as he had, although it did not concern her at all.  She did not know why she felt this way.\r\n\r\n At the close of the show it suddenly developed that he was not going back with them.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, aren't you?\"  said Carrie, with an unwarrantable feeling.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, no,\" he said;  \"I'm stopping right around here in Thirty- third Street.\"\r\n\r\n Carrie could not say anything else, but somehow this development shocked her.  She had been regretting the wane of a pleasant evening, but she had thought there was a half-hour more.  Oh, the half-hours, the minutes of the world;  what miseries and griefs are crowded into them!\r\n\r\n She said good-bye with feigned indifference.  What matter could it make?  Still, the coach seemed lorn.\r\n\r\n When she went into her own flat she had this to think about.  She did not know whether she would ever see this man any more.  What difference could it make—what difference could it make?\r\n\r\n Hurstwood had returned, and was already in bed.  His clothes were scattered loosely about.  Carrie came to the door and saw him, then retreated.  She did not want to go in yet a while.  She wanted to think.  It was disagreeable to her.\r\n\r\n Back in the dining-room she sat in her chair and rocked.  Her little hands were folded tightly as she thought.  Through a fog of longing and conflicting desires she was beginning to see.  Oh, ye legions of hope and pity—of sorrow and pain!  She was rocking, and beginning to see. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXXIII\r\n\r\n WITHOUT THE WALLED CITY—THE SLOPE OF THE YEARS\r\n\r\n The immediate result of this was nothing.  Results from such things are usually long in growing.  Morning brings a change of feeling.  The existent condition invariably pleads for itself.  It is only at odd moments that we get glimpses of the misery of things.  The heart understands when it is confronted with contrasts.  Take them away and the ache subsides.\r\n\r\n"

But while it may seem like every corner of the world has been surveyed and charted, navigating the world of indoors spaces can still be somewhat vexing.  A map may help you get from your house to the airport but often times it leaves you at the front door.  Many places provide a \"You are Here\" directory.  But if you don't know where \"here\" is in relation to \"there\"\" you can quickly become lost in a veritable labyrinth of unknown twists and turns.  This is why the mapping folks at Google added indoor Google Maps.  Now it's easy to figure out where you are orient yourself and even know what floor you're on.  Best of all, this feature now appears right within Google Maps on Android devices, meaning you can plan your trip the whole way through and never worry about getting lost in the wrong department again."

        "text":"\"There're some cots upstairs,\" interrupted the man, \"if you want one of them.\"\r\n\r\n \"That'll do,\" he assented.\r\n\r\n He meant to ask for a meal ticket, but the seemingly proper moment never came, and he decided to pay himself that night.\r\n\r\n \"I'll ask him in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n He ate in a cheap restaurant in the vicinity, and, being cold and lonely, went straight off to seek the loft in question.  The company was not attempting to run cars after nightfall.  It was so advised by the police.\r\n\r\n The room seemed to have been a lounging place for night workers.  There were some nine cots in the place, two or three wooden chairs, a soap box, and a small, round-bellied stove, in which a fire was blazing.  Early as he was, another man was there before him.  The latter was sitting beside the stove warming his hands.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood approached and held out his own toward the fire.  He was sick of the bareness and privation of all things connected with his venture, but was steeling himself to hold out.  He fancied he could for a while.\r\n\r\n \"Cold, isn't it?\"  said the early guest.\r\n\r\n \"Rather.\"\r\n\r\n A long silence.\r\n\r\n \"Not much of a place to sleep in, is it?\"  said the man.\r\n\r\n \"Better than nothing,\" replied Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n Another silence.\r\n\r\n \"I believe I'll turn in,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n Rising, he went to one of the cots and stretched himself, removing only his shoes, and pulling the one blanket and dirty old comforter over him in a sort of bundle.  The sight disgusted Hurstwood, but he did not dwell on it, choosing to gaze into the stove and think of something else.  Presently he decided to retire, and picked a cot, also removing his shoes.\r\n\r\n While he was doing so, the youth who had advised him to come here entered, and, seeing Hurstwood, tried to be genial.\r\n\r\n \"Better'n nothin',\" he observed, looking around.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood did not take this to himself.  He thought it to be an expression of individual satisfaction, and so did not answer.  The youth imagined he was out of sorts, and set to whistling softly.  Seeing another man asleep, he quit that and lapsed into silence.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothes and pushing away the dirty covering from his head, but at last he dozed in sheer weariness.  The covering became more and more comfortable, its character was forgotten, and he pulled it about his neck and slept.  In the morning he was aroused out of a pleasant dream by several men stirring about in the cold, cheerless room.  He had been back in Chicago in fancy, in his own comfortable home.  Jessica had been arranging to go somewhere, and he had been talking with her about it.  This was so clear in his mind, that he was startled now by the contrast of this room.  He raised his head, and the cold, bitter reality jarred him into wakefulness.\r\n\r\n \"Guess I'd better get up,\" he said.\r\n\r\n There was no water on this floor.  He put on his shoes in the cold and stood up, shaking himself in his stiffness.  His clothes felt disagreeable, his hair bad.\r\n\r\n \"Hell!\"  he muttered, as he put on his hat.\r\n\r\n Downstairs things were stirring again.\r\n\r\n He found a hydrant, with a trough which had once been used for horses, but there was no towel here, and his handkerchief was soiled from yesterday.  He contented himself with wetting his eyes with the ice-cold water.  Then he sought the foreman, who was already on the ground.\r\n\r\n \"Had your breakfast yet?\"  inquired that worthy.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" said Hurstwood.\r\n\r\n \"Better get it, then;  your car won't be ready for a little while.\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood hesitated.\r\n\r\n \"Could you let me have a meal ticket?\"  he asked with an effort.\r\n\r\n \"Here you are,\" said the man, handing him one.\r\n\r\n He breakfasted as poorly as the night before on some fried steak and bad coffee.  Then he went back.\r\n\r\n \"Here,\" said the foreman, motioning him, when he came in.  \"You take this car out in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood climbed up on the platform in the gloomy barn and waited for a signal.  He was nervous, and yet the thing was a relief.  Anything was better than the barn.\r\n\r\n On this the fourth day of the strike, the situation had taken a turn for the worse.  The strikers, following the counsel of their leaders and the newspapers, had struggled peaceably enough.  There had been no great violence done.  Cars had been stopped, it is true, and the men argued with.  Some crews had been won over and led away, some windows broken, some jeering and yelling done;  but in no more than five or six instances had men been seriously injured.  These by crowds whose acts the leaders disclaimed.\r\n\r\n Idleness, however, and the sight of the company, backed by the police, triumphing, angered the men.  They saw that each day more cars were going on, each day more declarations were being made by the company officials that the effective opposition of the strikers was broken.  This put desperate thoughts in the minds of the men.  Peaceful methods meant, they saw, that the companies would soon run all their cars and those who had complained would be forgotten.  There was nothing so helpful to the companies as peaceful methods.  All at once they blazed forth, and for a week there was storm and stress.  Cars were assailed, men attacked, policemen struggled with, tracks torn up, and shots fired, until at last street fights and mob movements became frequent, and the city was invested with militia.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood knew nothing of the change of temper.\r\n\r\n \"Run your car out,\" called the foreman, waving a vigorous hand at him.  A green conductor jumped up behind and rang the bell twice as a signal to start.  Hurstwood turned the lever and ran the car out through the door into the street in front of the barn.  Here two brawny policemen got up beside him on the platform—one on either hand.\r\n\r\n At the sound of a gong near the barn door, two bells were given by the conductor and Hurstwood opened his lever.\r\n\r\n The two policemen looked about them calmly.\r\n\r\n \"'Tis cold, all right, this morning,\" said the one on the left, who possessed a rich brogue.\r\n\r\n \"I had enough of it yesterday,\" said the other.  \"I wouldn't want a steady job of this.\"\r\n\r\n \"Nor I.\"\r\n\r\n Neither paid the slightest attention to Hurstwood, who stood facing the cold wind, which was chilling him completely, and thinking of his orders.\r\n\r\n \"Keep a steady gait,\" the foreman had said.  \"Don't stop for any one who doesn't look like a real passenger.  Whatever you do, don't stop for a crowd.\"\r\n\r\n The two officers kept silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n \"The last man must have gone through all right,\" said the officer on the left.  \"I don't see his car anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n \"Who's on there?\"  asked the second officer, referring, of course, to its complement of policemen.\r\n\r\n \"Schaeffer and Ryan.\"\r\n\r\n There was another silence, in which the car ran smoothly along.  There were not so many houses along this part of the way.  Hurstwood did not see many people either.  The situation was not wholly disagreeable to him.  If he were not so cold, he thought he would do well enough.\r\n\r\n He was brought out of this feeling by the sudden appearance of a curve ahead, which he had not expected.  He shut off the current and did an energetic turn at the brake, but not in time to avoid an unnaturally quick turn.  It shook him up and made him feel like making some apologetic remarks, but he refrained.\r\n\r\n \"You want to look out for them things,\" said the officer on the left, condescendingly.\r\n\r\n \"That's right,\" agreed Hurstwood, shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n \"There's lots of them on this line,\" said the officer on the right.  Around the corner a more populated way appeared.  One or two pedestrians were in view ahead.  A boy coming out of a gate with a tin milk bucket gave Hurstwood his first objectionable greeting.\r\n\r\n \"Scab!\"  he yelled.  \"Scab!\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood heard it, but tried to make no comment, even to himself.  He knew he would get that, and much more of the same sort, probably.\r\n\r\n At a corner farther up a man stood by the track and signalled the car to stop.\r\n\r\n \"Never mind him,\" said one of the officers.  \"He's up to some game.\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood obeyed.  At the corner he saw the wisdom of it.  No sooner did the man perceive the intention to ignore him, than he shook his fist.\r\n\r\n \"Ah, you bloody coward!\"  he yelled.\r\n\r\n Some half dozen men, standing on the corner, flung taunts and jeers after the speeding car.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood winced the least bit.  The real thing was slightly worse than the thoughts of it had been.\r\n\r\n Now came in sight, three or four blocks farther on, a heap of something on the track.\r\n\r\n \"They've been at work, here, all right,\" said one of the policemen.\r\n\r\n \"We'll have an argument, maybe,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood ran the car close and stopped.  He had not done so wholly, however, before a crowd gathered about.  It was composed of ex-motormen and conductors in part, with a sprinkling of friends and sympathisers.\r\n\r\n \"Come off the car, pardner,\" said one of the men in a voice meant to be conciliatory.  \"You don't want to take the bread out of another man's mouth, do you?\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood held to his brake and lever, pale and very uncertain what to do.\r\n\r\n \"Stand back,\" yelled one of the officers, leaning over the platform railing.  \"Clear out of this, now.  Give the man a chance to do his work.\"\r\n\r\n \"Listen, pardner,\" said the leader, ignoring the policeman and addressing Hurstwood.  \"We're all working men, like yourself.  If you were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we've been, you wouldn't want any one to come in and take your place, would you?  You wouldn't want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights, would you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Shut her off!  shut her off!\"  urged the other of the policemen, roughly.  \"Get out of this, now,\" and he jumped the railing and landed before the crowd and began shoving.  Instantly the other officer was down beside him.\r\n\r\n \"Stand back, now,\" they yelled.  \"Get out of this.  What the hell do you mean?  Out, now.\"\r\n\r\n It was like a small swarm of bees.\r\n\r\n \"Don't shove me,\" said one of the strikers, determinedly.  \"I'm not doing anything.\"\r\n\r\n \"Get out of this!\"  cried the officer, swinging his club.  \"I'll give ye a bat on the sconce.  Back, now.\"\r\n\r\n \"What the hell!\"  cried another of the strikers, pushing the other way, adding at the same time some lusty oaths.\r\n\r\n Crack came an officer's club on his forehead.  He blinked his eyes blindly a few times, wabbled on his legs, threw up his hands, and staggered back.  In return, a swift fist landed on the officer's neck.\r\n\r\n Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, laying about madly with his club.  He was ably assisted by his brother of the blue, who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters.  No severe damage was done, owing to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach.  They stood about the sidewalk now and jeered.\r\n\r\n \"Where is the conductor?\"  yelled one of the officers, getting his eye on that individual, who had come nervously forward to stand by Hurstwood.  The latter had stood gazing upon the scene with more astonishment than fear.\r\n\r\n \"Why don't you come down here and get these stones off the track?\"  inquired the officer.  \"What you standing there for?  Do you want to stay here all day?  Get down.\"\r\n\r\n Hurstwood breathed heavily in excitement and jumped down with the nervous conductor as if he had been called.\r\n\r\n \"Hurry up, now,\" said the other policeman.\r\n\r\n Cold as it was, these officers were hot and mad.  Hurstwood worked with the conductor, lifting stone after stone and warming himself by the work.\r\n\r\n \"Ah, you scab, you!\"  yelled the crowd.  \"You coward!  Steal a man's job, will you?  Rob the poor, will you, you thief?  We'll get you yet, now.  Wait.\"\r\n\r\n Not all of this was delivered by one man.  It came from here and there, incorporated with much more of the same sort and curses.\r\n\r\n \"Work, you blackguards,\" yelled a voice.  \"Do the dirty work.  You're the suckers that keep the poor people down!\"\r\n\r\n \"May God starve ye yet,\" yelled an old Irish woman, who now threw open a nearby window and stuck out her head.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, and you,\" she added, catching the eye of one of the policemen.  \"You bloody, murtherin' thafe!  Crack my son over the head, will you, you hardhearted, murtherin' divil?  Ah, ye——\"\r\n\r\n But the officer turned a deaf ear.\r\n\r\n \"Go to the devil, you old hag,\" he half muttered as he stared round upon the scattered company.\r\n\r\n Now the stones were off, and Hurstwood took his place again amid a continued chorus of epithets.  Both officers got up beside him and the conductor rang the bell, when, bang!  bang!  through window and door came rocks and stones.  One narrowly grazed Hurstwood's head.  Another shattered the window behind.\r\n\r\n \"Throw open your lever,\" yelled one of the officers, grabbing at the handle himself.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood complied and the car shot away, followed by a rattle of stones and a rain of curses.\r\n\r\n \"That —- —- —- —— hit me in the neck,\" said one of the officers.  \"I gave him a good crack for it, though.\"\r\n\r\n \"I think I must have left spots on some of them,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n \"I know that big guy that called us a —- —- —- ——\" said the first.  \"I'll get him yet for that.\"\r\n\r\n \"I thought we were in for it sure, once there,\" said the second.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood, warmed and excited, gazed steadily ahead.  It was an astonishing experience for him.  He had read of these things, but the reality seemed something altogether new.  He was no coward in spirit.  The fact that he had suffered this much now rather operated to arouse a stolid determination to stick it out.  He did not recur in thought to New York or the flat.  This one trip seemed a consuming thing.\r\n\r\n They now ran into the business heart of Brooklyn uninterrupted.  People gazed at the broken windows of the car and at Hurstwood in his plain clothes.  Voices called \"scab\" now and then, as well as other epithets, but no crowd attacked the car.  At the downtown end of the line, one of the officers went to call up his station and report the trouble.\r\n\r\n \"There's a gang out there,\" he said, \"laying for us yet.  Better send some one over there and clean them out.\"\r\n\r\n The car ran back more quietly—hooted, watched, flung at, but not attacked.  Hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns.\r\n\r\n \"Well,\" he observed to himself, \"I came out of that all right.\"\r\n\r\n The car was turned in and he was allowed to loaf a while, but later he was again called.  This time a new team of officers was aboard.  Slightly more confident, he sped the car along the commonplace streets and felt somewhat less fearful.  On one side, however, he suffered intensely.  The day was raw, with a sprinkling of snow and a gusty wind, made all the more intolerable by the speed of the car.  His clothing was not intended for this sort of work.  He shivered, stamped his feet, and beat his arms as he had seen other motormen do in the past, but said nothing.  The novelty and danger of the situation modified in a way his disgust and distress at being compelled to be here, but not enough to prevent him from feeling grim and sour.  This was a dog's life, he thought.  It was a tough thing to have to come to.\r\n\r\n The one thought that strengthened him was the insult offered by Carrie.  He was not down so low as to take all that, he thought.  He could do something—this, even—for a while.  It would get better.  He would save a little.\r\n\r\n A boy threw a clod of mud while he was thus reflecting and hit him upon the arm.  It hurt sharply and angered him more than he had been any time since morning.\r\n\r\n \"The little cur!\"  he muttered.\r\n\r\n \"Hurt you?\"  asked one of the policemen.\r\n\r\n \"No,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n At one of the corners, where the car slowed up because of a turn, an ex-motorman, standing on the sidewalk, called to him:\r\n\r\n \"Won't you come out, pardner, and be a man?  Remember we're fighting for decent day's wages, that's all.  We've got families to support.\"  The man seemed most peaceably inclined.\r\n\r\n Hurstwood pretended not to see him.  He kept his eyes straight on before and opened the lever wide.  The voice had something appealing in it.\r\n\r\n All morning this went on and long into the afternoon.  He made three such trips.  The dinner he had was no stay for such work and the cold was telling on him.  At each end of the line he stopped to thaw out, but he could have groaned at the anguish of it.  One of the barnmen, out of pity, loaned him a heavy cap and a pair of sheepskin gloves, and for once he was extremely thankful.\r\n\r\n On the second trip of the afternoon he ran into a crowd about half way along the line, that had blocked the car's progress with an old telegraph pole.\r\n\r\n \"Get that thing off the track,\" shouted the two policemen.\r\n\r\n \"Yah, yah, yah!\"  yelled the crowd.  \"Get it off yourself.\"\r\n\r\n The two policemen got down and Hurstwood started to follow.\r\n\r\n \"You stay there,\" one called.  \"Some one will run away with your car.\"\r\n\r\n Amid the babel of voices, Hurstwood heard one close beside him.\r\n\r\n \"Come down, pardner, and be a man.  Don't fight the poor.  Leave that to the corporations.\"\r\n\r\n He saw the same fellow who had called to him from the corner.  Now, as before, he pretended not to hear him.\r\n\r\n \"Come down,\" the man repeated gently.  \"You don't want to fight poor men.  Don't fight at all.\"  It was a most philosophic and jesuitical motorman.\r\n\r\n A third policeman joined the other two from somewhere and some one ran to telephone for more officers.  Hurstwood gazed about, determined but fearful.\r\n\r\n A man grabbed him by the coat.\r\n\r\n \"Come off of that,\" he exclaimed, jerking at him and trying to pull him over the railing.\r\n\r\n \"Let go,\" said Hurstwood, savagely.\r\n\r\n \"I'll show you—you scab!\"  cried a young Irishman, jumping up on the car and aiming a blow at Hurstwood.  The latter ducked and caught it on the shoulder instead of the jaw.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"No one was around when the solar system formed, but some scientists say it began with a blast.  And they mean a big one: A nearby supernova, or explosion of a giant star, may have provided the oomph that jump-started the formation of the sun and planets.\r\n\r\n Scientists suspect that more than 4.5 billion years ago, our swath of space had no sun, no asteroids, no planets, and no arguments about Pluto.  Were you to go back in time, you’d instead find a large cloud of cold gas and dust.  Obviously, it didn’t stay that way.  Something happened, causing particles to clump together into one big star and lots of smaller rocks.\r\n\r\n That something might have been a star that exploded about 15 light-years away, say astrophysicists with a new idea about how the solar system formed.  Astrophysicists study stars and other objects in space to learn what they’re made of and how the bodies form.  In this case, scientists used a computer model to test the idea that a nearby supernova triggered the cloud to turn into a star and planets.\r\n\r\n Matthias Gritschneder, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Science News that the exploding-star idea provides a tidy solution to the mystery of the solar system’s origin.  “With the supernova, you have one triggering event, and you don’t have to invoke a complicated chain of events,” he said.\r\n\r\n A supernova sends a wave of energy, called a shock wave, racing through space faster than 6,000 miles per second.  It sweeps up what’s left of the star’s mass and blows it away.  This shock wave differs from a gently rolling water wave;  it’s more like a tsunami, a giant wall of energy and matter that pummels anything in its way.  In the computer model by Gritschneder and his colleagues, the energy from a shock wave could have started collapsing the cold cloud of dust and gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n Meet Cassiopeia A, a supernova remnant from a star that exploded about 300 years ago.  The shock wave of this supernova shows up as the outer green edge in this picture, taken by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.  Credit: Oak Ridge National Laboratory\r\n Gritschneder isn’t the only one thinking about exploding stars.  Astrophysicist Alan Boss, from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., also has shown how a supernova’s shock wave might have formed the solar system.  He took a different approach than Gritschneder but reached the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n “The basic results are the same for both of us, which is a relief,” Boss told Science News.  On November 8, Boss talked about his work with other scientists at a meeting in Kauai, Hawaii.\r\n\r\n Scientists gain confidence in radical ideas when different approaches produce the same answer.  Fred Ciesla, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, told Science News that even though many questions remain, the supernova idea is a good one.  And it might help scientists understand how other worlds formed far beyond our solar system.\r\n\r\n “Work like this says something about how stars and planets formed, and whether it’s consistent with the data we have,” Ciesla says.  “Once we’ve been able to accumulate enough information, we can start to speculate about how frequently this works in other places in the galaxy.”\r\n\r\n POWER WORDS (adapted from the New Oxford American Dictionary)\r\n\r\n solar system ——- The eight major planets and their moons in orbit around the sun, together with smaller bodies in the form of dwarf planets, asteroids, meteoroids and comets.\r\n\r\n supernova —— A massive star that suddenly increases greatly in brightness because of a catastrophic explosion that ejects most of its mass.\r\n\r\n galaxy —-  A system of millions or billions of stars, together with gas and dust, held together by gravity."

        "text":" Our success goes with the success of that, you know\"—and he paused and looked at his son.  \"If Cowperwood should fail and that money couldn't be put back—\" He broke off abstractedly.  \"The thing that's troublin' me is this matter of Stener and the city treasury.  If somethin' ain't done about that, it may go hard with the party this fall, and with some of our contracts.  You don't want to forget that an election is comin' along in November.  I'm wonderin' if I ought to call in that one hundred thousand dollars.  It's goin' to take considerable money to meet my loans in the mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n It is a curious matter of psychology, but it was only now that the real difficulties of the situation were beginning to dawn on Butler.  In the presence of Cowperwood he was so influenced by that young man's personality and his magnetic presentation of his need and his own liking for him that he had not stopped to consider all the phases of his own relationship to the situation.  Out here in the cool night air, talking to Owen, who was ambitious on his own account and anything but sentimentally considerate of Cowperwood, he was beginning to sober down and see things in their true light.  He had to admit that Cowperwood had seriously compromised the city treasury and the Republican party, and incidentally Butler's own private interests.  Nevertheless, he liked Cowperwood.  He was in no way prepared to desert him.  He was now going to see Mollenhauer and Simpson as much to save Cowperwood really as the party and his own affairs.  And yet a scandal.  He did not like that—resented it.  This young scalawag!  To think he should be so sly.  None the less he still liked him, even here and now, and was feeling that he ought to do something to help the young man, if anything could help him.  He might even leave his hundred-thousand-dollar loan with him until the last hour, as Cowperwood had requested, if the others were friendly.\r\n\r\n \"Well, father,\" said Owen, after a time, \"I don't see why you need to worry any more than Mollenhauer or Simpson.  If you three want to help him out, you can;  but for the life of me I don't see why you should.  I know this thing will have a bad effect on the election, if it comes out before then;  but it could be hushed up until then, couldn't it?  Anyhow, your street-railway holdings are more important than this election, and if you can see your way clear to getting the street-railway lines in your hands you won't need to worry about any elections.  My advice to you is to call that one-hundred-thousand-dollar loan of yours in the morning, and meet the drop in your stocks that way.  It may make Cowperwood fail, but that won't hurt you any.  You can go into the market and buy his stocks.  I wouldn't be surprised if he would run to you and ask you to take them.  You ought to get Mollenhauer and Simpson to scare Stener so that he won't loan Cowperwood any more money.  If you don't, Cowperwood will run there and get more.  Stener's in too far now.  If Cowperwood won't sell out, well and good;  the chances are he will bust, anyhow, and then you can pick up as much on the market as any one else.  I think he'll sell.  You can't afford to worry about Stener's five hundred thousand dollars.  No one told him to loan it.  Let him look out for himself.  It may hurt the party, but you can look after that later.  You and Mollenhauer can fix the newspapers so they won't talk about it till after election.\"\r\n\r\n \"Aisy!  Aisy!\"  was all the old contractor would say.  He was thinking hard. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXV\r\n\r\n The residence of Henry A. Mollenhauer was, at that time, in a section of the city which was almost as new as that in which Butler was living.  It was on South Broad Street, near a handsome library building which had been recently erected.  It was a spacious house of the type usually affected by men of new wealth in those days—a structure four stories in height of yellow brick and white stone built after no school which one could readily identify, but not unattractive in its architectural composition.  A broad flight of steps leading to a wide veranda gave into a decidedly ornate door, which was set on either side by narrow windows and ornamented to the right and left with pale-blue jardinieres of considerable charm of outline.  The interior, divided into twenty rooms, was paneled and parqueted in the most expensive manner for homes of that day.  There was a great reception-hall, a large parlor or drawing-room, a dining-room at least thirty feet square paneled in oak;  and on the second floor were a music-room devoted to the talents of Mollenhauer's three ambitious daughters, a library and private office for himself, a boudoir and bath for his wife, and a conservatory.\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer was, and felt himself to be, a very important man.  His financial and political judgment was exceedingly keen.  Although he was a German, or rather an American of German parentage, he was a man of a rather impressive American presence.  He was tall and heavy and shrewd and cold.  His large chest and wide shoulders supported a head of distinguished proportions, both round and long when seen from different angles.  The frontal bone descended in a protruding curve over the nose, and projected solemnly over the eyes, which burned with a shrewd, inquiring gaze.  And the nose and mouth and chin below, as well as his smooth, hard cheeks, confirmed the impression that he knew very well what he wished in this world, and was very able without regard to let or hindrance to get it.  It was a big face, impressive, well modeled.  He was an excellent friend of Edward Malia Butler's, as such friendships go, and his regard for Mark Simpson was as sincere as that of one tiger for another.  He respected ability;  he was willing to play fair when fair was the game.  When it was not, the reach of his cunning was not easily measured.\r\n\r\n When Edward Butler and his son arrived on this Sunday evening, this distinguished representative of one-third of the city's interests was not expecting them.  He was in his library reading and listening to one of his daughters playing the piano.  His wife and his other two daughters had gone to church.  He was of a domestic turn of mind.  Still, Sunday evening being an excellent one for conference purposes generally in the world of politics, he was not without the thought that some one or other of his distinguished confreres might call, and when the combination footman and butler announced the presence of Butler and his son, he was well pleased.\r\n\r\n \"So there you are,\" he remarked to Butler, genially, extending his hand.  \"I'm certainly glad to see you.  And Owen!  How are you, Owen?  What will you gentlemen have to drink, and what will you smoke?  I know you'll have something.  John\"—to the servitor—-\"see if you can find something for these gentlemen.  I have just been listening to Caroline play;  but I think you've frightened her off for the time being.\"\r\n\r\n He moved a chair into position for Butler, and indicated to Owen another on the other side of the table.  In a moment his servant had returned with a silver tray of elaborate design, carrying whiskies and wines of various dates and cigars in profusion.  Owen was the new type of young financier who neither smoked nor drank.  His father temperately did both.\r\n\r\n \"It's a comfortable place you have here,\" said Butler, without any indication of the important mission that had brought him.  \"I don't wonder you stay at home Sunday evenings.  What's new in the city?\"\r\n\r\n \"Nothing much, so far as I can see,\" replied Mollenhauer, pacifically.  \"Things seem to be running smooth enough.  You don't know anything that we ought to worry about, do you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, yes,\" said Butler, draining off the remainder of a brandy and soda that had been prepared for him.  \"One thing.  You haven't seen an avenin' paper, have you?\"\r\n\r\n \"No, I haven't,\" said Mollenhauer, straightening up.  \"Is there one out?  What's the trouble anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n \"Nothing—except Chicago's burning, and it looks as though we'd have a little money-storm here in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n \"You don't say!  I didn't hear that.  There's a paper out, is there?  Well, well—is it much of a fire?\"\r\n\r\n \"The city is burning down, so they say,\" put in Owen, who was watching the face of the distinguished politician with considerable interest.\r\n\r\n \"Well, that is news.  I must send out and get a paper.  John!\"  he called.  His man-servant appeared.  \"See if you can get me a paper somewhere.\"  The servant disappeared.  \"What makes you think that would have anything to do with us?\"  observed Mollenhauer, returning to Butler.\r\n\r\n \"Well, there's one thing that goes with that that I didn't know till a little while ago and that is that our man Stener is apt to be short in his accounts, unless things come out better than some people seem to think,\" suggested Butler, calmly.  \"That might not look so well before election, would it?\"  His shrewd gray Irish eyes looked into Mollenhauer's, who returned his gaze.\r\n\r\n \"Where did you get that?\"  queried Mr. Mollenhauer icily.  \"He hasn't deliberately taken much money, has he?  How much has he taken—do you know?\"\r\n\r\n \"Quite a bit,\" replied Butler, quietly.  \"Nearly five hundred thousand, so I understand.  Only I wouldn't say that it has been taken as yet.  It's in danger of being lost.\"\r\n\r\n \"Five hundred thousand!\"  exclaimed Mollenhauer in amazement, and yet preserving his usual calm.  \"You don't tell me!  How long has this been going on?  What has he been doing with the money?\"\r\n\r\n \"He's loaned a good deal—about five hundred thousand dollars to this young Cowperwood in Third Street, that's been handlin' city loan.  They've been investin' it for themselves in one thing and another—mostly in buyin' up street-railways.\"  (At the mention of street-railways Mollenhauer's impassive countenance underwent a barely perceptible change.)  \"This fire, accordin' to Cowperwood, is certain to produce a panic in the mornin', and unless he gets considerable help he doesn't see how he's to hold out.  If he doesn't hold out, there'll be five hundred thousand dollars missin' from the city treasury which can't be put back.  Stener's out of town and Cowperwood's come to me to see what can be done about it.  As a matter of fact, he's done a little business for me in times past, and he thought maybe I could help him now—that is, that I might get you and the Senator to see the big bankers with me and help support the market in the mornin'.  If we don't he's goin' to fail, and he thought the scandal would hurt us in the election.  He doesn't appear to me to be workin' any game—just anxious to save himself and do the square thing by me—by us, if he can.\"  Butler paused.\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer, sly and secretive himself, was apparently not at all moved by this unexpected development.  At the same time, never having thought of Stener as having any particular executive or financial ability, he was a little stirred and curious.  So his treasurer was using money without his knowing it, and now stood in danger of being prosecuted!  Cowperwood he knew of only indirectly, as one who had been engaged to handle city loan.  He had profited by his manipulation of city loan.  Evidently the banker had made a fool of Stener, and had used the money for street-railway shares!  He and Stener must have quite some private holdings then.  That did interest Mollenhauer greatly.\r\n\r\n \"Five hundred thousand dollars!\"  he repeated, when Butler had finished.  \"That is quite a little money.  If merely supporting the market would save Cowperwood we might do that, although if it's a severe panic I do not see how anything we can do will be of very much assistance to him.  If he's in a very tight place and a severe slump is coming, it will take a great deal more than our merely supporting the market to save him.  I've been through that before.  You don't know what his liabilities are?\"\r\n\r\n \"I do not,\" said Butler.\r\n\r\n \"He didn't ask for money, you say?\"\r\n\r\n \"He wants me to l'ave a hundred thousand he has of mine until he sees whether he can get through or not.\"\r\n\r\n \"Stener is really out of town, I suppose?\"  Mollenhauer was innately suspicious.\r\n\r\n \"So Cowperwood says.  We can send and find out.\"\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer was thinking of the various aspects of the case.  Supporting the market would be all very well if that would save Cowperwood, and the Republican party and his treasurer.  At the same time Stener could then be compelled to restore the five hundred thousand dollars to the city treasury, and release his holdings to some one—preferably to him—Mollenhauer.  But here was Butler also to be considered in this matter.  What might he not want?  He consulted with Butler and learned that Cowperwood had agreed to return the five hundred thousand in case he could get it together.  The various street-car holdings were not asked after.  But what assurance had any one that Cowperwood could be so saved?  And could, or would get the money together?  And if he were saved would he give the money back to Stener?  If he required actual money, who would loan it to him in a time like this—in case a sharp panic was imminent?  What security could he give?  On the other hand, under pressure from the right parties he might be made to surrender all his street-railway holdings for a song—his and Stener's.  If he (Mollenhauer) could get them he would not particularly care whether the election was lost this fall or not, although he felt satisfied, as had Owen, that it would not be lost.  It could be bought, as usual.  The defalcation—if Cowperwood's failure made Stener's loan into one—could be concealed long enough, Mollenhauer thought, to win.  Personally as it came to him now he would prefer to frighten Stener into refusing Cowperwood additional aid, and then raid the latter's street-railway stock in combination with everybody else's, for that matter—Simpson's and Butler's included.  One of the big sources of future wealth in Philadelphia lay in these lines.  For the present, however, he had to pretend an interest in saving the party at the polls.\r\n\r\n \"I can't speak for the Senator, that's sure,\" pursued Mollenhauer, reflectively.  \"I don't know what he may think.  As for myself, I am perfectly willing to do what I can to keep up the price of stocks, if that will do any good.  I would do so naturally in order to protect my loans.  The thing that we ought to be thinking about, in my judgment, is how to prevent exposure, in case Mr. Cowperwood does fail, until after election.  We have no assurance, of course, that however much we support the market we will be able to sustain it.\"\r\n\r\n \"We have not,\" replied Butler, solemnly.\r\n\r\n Owen thought he could see Cowperwood's approaching doom quite plainly.  At that moment the door-bell rang.  A maid, in the absence of the footman, brought in the name of Senator Simpson.\r\n\r\n \"Just the man,\" said Mollenhauer.  \"Show him up.  You can see what he thinks.\"\r\n\r\n \"Perhaps I had better leave you alone now,\" suggested Owen to his father.  \"Perhaps I can find Miss Caroline, and she will sing for me.  I'll wait for you, father,\" he added.\r\n\r\n Mollenhauer cast him an ingratiating smile, and as he stepped out Senator Simpson walked in.\r\n\r\n A more interesting type of his kind than Senator Mark Simpson never flourished in the State of Pennsylvania, which has been productive of interesting types.  Contrasted with either of the two men who now greeted him warmly and shook his hand, he was physically unimpressive.  He was small—five feet nine inches, to Mollenhauer's six feet and Butler's five feet eleven inches and a half, and then his face was smooth, with a receding jaw.  In the other two this feature was prominent.  Nor were his eyes as frank as those of Butler, nor as defiant as those of Mollenhauer;  but for subtlety they were unmatched by either—deep, strange, receding, cavernous eyes which contemplated you as might those of a cat looking out of a dark hole, and suggesting all the artfulness that has ever distinguished the feline family.  He had a strange mop of black hair sweeping down over a fine, low, white forehead, and a skin as pale and bluish as poor health might make it;  but there was, nevertheless, resident here a strange, resistant, capable force that ruled men—the subtlety with which he knew how to feed cupidity with hope and gain and the ruthlessness with which he repaid those who said him nay.  He was a still man, as such a man might well have been—feeble and fish-like in his handshake, wan and slightly lackadaisical in his smile, but speaking always with eyes that answered for every defect.\r\n\r\n \"Av'nin', Mark, I'm glad to see you,\" was Butler's greeting.\r\n\r\n \"How are you, Edward?\"  came the quiet reply.\r\n\r\n \"Well, Senator, you're not looking any the worse for wear.  Can I pour you something?\"\r\n\r\n \"Nothing to-night, Henry,\" replied Simpson.  \"I haven't long to stay.  I just stopped by on my way home.  My wife's over here at the Cavanaghs', and I have to stop by to fetch her.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, it's a good thing you dropped in, Senator, just when you did,\" began Mollenhauer, seating himself after his guest.  \"Butler here has been telling me of a little political problem that has arisen since I last saw you.  I suppose you've heard that Chicago is burning?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  Cavanagh was just telling me.  It looks to be quite serious.  I think the market will drop heavily in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n \"I wouldn't be surprised myself,\" put in Mollenhauer, laconically.\r\n\r\n \"Here's the paper now,\" said Butler, as John, the servant, came in from the street bearing the paper in his hand.  Mollenhauer took it and spread it out before them. "

        "text":"IMPOSTER SYNDROME.  YOU’RE THE REAL YOU!\r\n\r\n An intelligent and talented friend of mine told me the other night that graduate school occasionally gives her imposter syndrome.  I guess this phrase is, like, a thing.  But I’d never heard it before, and it caused me to have a moment.\r\n\r\n Imposter syndrome.  You’re finally making the big leaps in life that you never imagined when you were seven or seventeen, and it’s so shocking that something feels false about it, like it’s not really you.  This isn’t the real you.  The real you sits in the basement and eats potato chips, until one day, you came out and kidnapped a real graduate student and stole his identity and took his place!  There must be a Liam Neeson movie or two about this.\r\n\r\n I understand the urge to believe only the stories that make us seem small.  Sometimes I can scarcely believe that I just bowled a strike.\r\n\r\n When positive changes are happening, I live most gracefully through them if I can somehow acquire two perspectives to juggle.  Binocular vision, you know?  There’s a part of me that can marvel at the wonder of Time and Progress and ponder “How did I get here?” , and a part of me that can classily dismiss it like it was inevitable, like it’s not completely unbelievable that I can get a job or a certain number of thousands of Facebook likes.  As my friend puts it, “IDGAF”.  I’m sure you can figure out what that stands for.  Or the other perspective could be another person’s, who incidentally reports on what’s happening with you, but also takes part in your healthy, balanced life so you don’t have to overthink this kind of thing.\r\n\r\n Imposter syndrome is a double whammy, because even if you accept that yes, this is really happening, you still don’t necessarily get past that it’s happening to you.  You don’t have to change your perception of yourself and acknowledge that something is going on with you.\r\n\r\n Which is ridiculous, when it’s a positive change.  I don’t engorge myself on candy and think “Is this real life?”  I think, “Woohoo!”  Because the self that I know, he makes bad decisions on purpose.  That’s what he does.  If he does something right or achieves something, like working through the steps of a project at work or writing a blog post at work or helping a friend, well, it didn’t get on the news, so it’s not worth mentioning, or the time it would take my Stomach Of Self-Esteem to digest it.\r\n\r\n Sigh.  This needs to stop!  Well, not for me, since I have to write blog posts about it, but for anyone else.  This is gonna sound really grizzled and 1960s-movie-ending of me to say, but maybe the best way to deal with life is keep on living.  Helpful, right?\r\n\r\n You are the real you!  You really nailed that presentation and totally tricked that entire audience into believing that you’re not a dope.  You were really at that party, that late at night, and the next time you would get to brush your teeth was indeed uncertain.  You really scored a goal after juking four defenders!  Yes, with a sore hip!  Those were real adventures.  It’s just that you’re changing.  Your Wikipedia entry is constantly being edited.  You know that old adage about how you never step into the same river twice?  That’s trivial.  Because the same you is never coming back to even try.\r\n\r\n So it is impossible to suffer imposter syndrome as we know it.  Actually, I almost typed “be guilty of” there.  Like it’s a crime to have these feelings.  It’s not.\r\n\r\n Anyway, I cured imposter syndrome.  You’re welcome."

        "text":"It was among the earliest of the \"extras\" that were issued in this country, and contained a rather impressive spread of type announcing that the conflagration in the lake city was growing hourly worse since its inception the day before.\r\n\r\n \"Well, that is certainly dreadful,\" said Simpson.  \"I'm very sorry for Chicago.  I have many friends there.  I shall hope to hear that it is not so bad as it seems.\"\r\n\r\n The man had a rather grandiloquent manner which he never abandoned under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n \"The matter that Butler was telling me about,\" continued Mollenhauer, \"has something to do with this in a way.  You know the habit our city treasurers have of loaning out their money at two per cent. ?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes?\"  said Simpson, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n \"Well, Mr. Stener, it seems, has been loaning out a good deal of the city's money to this young Cowperwood, in Third Street, who has been handling city loans.\"\r\n\r\n \"You don't say!\"  said Simpson, putting on an air of surprise.  \"Not much, I hope?\"  The Senator, like Butler and Mollenhauer, was profiting greatly by cheap loans from the same source to various designated city depositories.\r\n\r\n \"Well, it seems that Stener has loaned him as much as five hundred thousand dollars, and if by any chance Cowperwood shouldn't be able to weather this storm, Stener is apt to be short that amount, and that wouldn't look so good as a voting proposition to the people in November, do you think?  Cowperwood owes Mr. Butler here one hundred thousand dollars, and because of that he came to see him to-night.  He wanted Butler to see if something couldn't be done through us to tide him over.  If not\"—he waved one hand suggestively—\"well, he might fail.\"\r\n\r\n Simpson fingered his strange, wide mouth with his delicate hand.  \"What have they been doing with the five hundred thousand dollars?\"  he asked.\r\n\r\n \"Oh, the boys must make a little somethin' on the side,\" said Butler, cheerfully.  \"I think they've been buyin' up street-railways, for one thing.\"  He stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his vest.  Both Mollenhauer and Simpson smiled wan smiles.\r\n\r\n \"Quite so,\" said Mollenhauer.  Senator Simpson merely looked the deep things that he thought.\r\n\r\n He, too, was thinking how useless it was for any one to approach a group of politicians with a proposition like this, particularly in a crisis such as bid fair to occur.  He reflected that if he and Butler and Mollenhauer could get together and promise Cowperwood protection in return for the surrender of his street-railway holdings it would be a very different matter.  It would be very easy in this case to carry the city treasury loan along in silence and even issue more money to support it;  but it was not sure, in the first place, that Cowperwood could be made to surrender his stocks, and in the second place that either Butler or Mollenhauer would enter into any such deal with him, Simpson.  Butler had evidently come here to say a good word for Cowperwood.  Mollenhauer and himself were silent rivals.  Although they worked together politically it was toward essentially different financial ends.  They were allied in no one particular financial proposition, any more than Mollenhauer and Butler were.  And besides, in all probability Cowperwood was no fool.  He was not equally guilty with Stener;  the latter had loaned him money.  The Senator reflected on whether he should broach some such subtle solution of the situation as had occurred to him to his colleagues, but he decided not.  Really Mollenhauer was too treacherous a man to work with on a thing of this kind.  It was a splendid chance but dangerous.  He had better go it alone.  For the present they should demand of Stener that he get Cowperwood to return the five hundred thousand dollars if he could.  If not, Stener could be sacrificed for the benefit of the party, if need be.  Cowperwood's stocks, with this tip as to his condition, would, Simpson reflected, offer a good opportunity for a little stock-exchange work on the part of his own brokers.  They could spread rumors as to Cowperwood's condition and then offer to take his shares off his hands—for a song, of course.  It was an evil moment that led Cowperwood to Butler.\r\n\r\n \"Well, now,\" said the Senator, after a prolonged silence, \"I might sympathize with Mr. Cowperwood in his situation, and I certainly don't blame him for buying up street-railways if he can;  but I really don't see what can be done for him very well in this crisis.  I don't know about you, gentlemen, but I am rather certain that I am not in a position to pick other people's chestnuts out of the fire if I wanted to, just now.  It all depends on whether we feel that the danger to the party is sufficient to warrant our going down into our pockets and assisting him.\"\r\n\r\n At the mention of real money to be loaned Mollenhauer pulled a long face.  \"I can't see that I will be able to do very much for Mr. Cowperwood,\" he sighed.\r\n\r\n \"Begad,\" said Buler, with a keen sense of humor, \"it looks to me as if I'd better be gettin' in my one hundred thousand dollars.  That's the first business of the early mornin'.\"  Neither Simpson nor Mollenhauer condescended on this occasion to smile even the wan smile they had smiled before.  They merely looked wise and solemn.\r\n\r\n \"But this matter of the city treasury, now,\" said Senator Simpson, after the atmosphere had been allowed to settle a little, \"is something to which we shall have to devote a little thought.  If Mr. Cowperwood should fail, and the treasury lose that much money, it would embarrass us no little.  What lines are they,\" he added, as an afterthought, \"that this man has been particularly interested in?\"\r\n\r\n \"I really don't know,\" replied Butler, who did not care to say what Owen had told him on the drive over.\r\n\r\n \"I don't see,\" said Mollenhauer, \"unless we can make Stener get the money back before this man Cowperwood fails, how we can save ourselves from considerable annoyance later;  but if we did anything which would look as though we were going to compel restitution, he would probably shut up shop anyhow.  So there's no remedy in that direction.  And it wouldn't be very kind to our friend Edward here to do it until we hear how he comes out on his affair.\"  He was referring to Butler's loan.\r\n\r\n \"Certainly not,\" said Senator Simpson, with true political sagacity and feeling.\r\n\r\n \"I'll have that one hundred thousand dollars in the mornin',\" said Butler, \"and never fear.\"\r\n\r\n \"I think,\" said Simpson, \"if anything comes of this matter that we will have to do our best to hush it up until after the election.  The newspapers can just as well keep silent on that score as not.  There's one thing I would suggest\"—and he was now thinking of the street-railway properties which Cowperwood had so judiciously collected—\"and that is that the city treasurer be cautioned against advancing any more money in a situation of this kind.  He might readily be compromised into advancing much more.  I suppose a word from you, Henry, would prevent that.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  I can do that,\" said Mollenhauer, solemnly.\r\n\r\n \"My judgement would be,\" said Butler, in a rather obscure manner, thinking of Cowperwood's mistake in appealing to these noble protectors of the public, \"that it's best to let sleepin' dogs run be thimselves.\"\r\n\r\n Thus ended Frank Cowperwood's dreams of what Butler and his political associates might do for him in his hour of distress.\r\n\r\n The energies of Cowperwood after leaving Butler were devoted to the task of seeing others who might be of some assistance to him.  He had left word with Mrs. Stener that if any message came from her husband he was to be notified at once.  He hunted up Walter Leigh, of Drexel & Co., Avery Stone of Jay Cooke & Co., and President Davison of the Girard National Bank.  He wanted to see what they thought of the situation and to negotiate a loan with President Davison covering all his real and personal property.\r\n\r\n \"I can't tell you, Frank,\" Walter Leigh insisted, \"I don't know how things will be running by to-morrow noon.  I'm glad to know how you stand.  I'm glad you're doing what you're doing—getting all your affairs in shape.  It will help a lot.  I'll favor you all I possibly can.  But if the chief decides on a certain group of loans to be called, they'll have to be called, that's all.  I'll do my best to make things look better.  If the whole of Chicago is wiped out, the insurance companies—some of them, anyhow—are sure to go, and then look out.  I suppose you'll call in all your loans?\"\r\n\r\n \"Not any more than I have to.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, that's just the way it is here—or will be.\"\r\n\r\n The two men shook hands.  They liked each other.  Leigh was of the city's fashionable coterie, a society man to the manner born, but with a wealth of common sense and a great deal of worldly experience.\r\n\r\n \"I'll tell you, Frank,\" he observed at parting, \"I've always thought you were carrying too much street-railway.  It's great stuff if you can get away with it, but it's just in a pinch like this that you're apt to get hurt.  You've been making money pretty fast out of that and city loans.\"\r\n\r\n He looked directly into his long-time friend's eyes, and they smiled.\r\n\r\n It was the same with Avery Stone, President Davison, and others.  They had all already heard rumors of disaster when he arrived.  They were not sure what the morrow would bring forth.  It looked very unpromising.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood decided to stop and see Butler again for he felt certain his interview with Mollenhauer and Simpson was now over.  Butler, who had been meditating what he should say to Cowperwood, was not unfriendly in his manner.  \"So you're back,\" he said, when Cowperwood appeared.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, Mr. Butler.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, I'm not sure that I've been able to do anything for you.  I'm afraid not,\" Butler said, cautiously.  \"It's a hard job you set me.  Mollenhauer seems to think that he'll support the market, on his own account.  I think he will.  Simpson has interests which he has to protect.  I'm going to buy for myself, of course.\"\r\n\r\n He paused to reflect.\r\n\r\n \"I couldn't get them to call a conference with any of the big moneyed men as yet,\" he added, warily.  \"They'd rather wait and see what happens in the mornin'.  Still, I wouldn't be down-hearted if I were you.  If things turn out very bad they may change their minds.  I had to tell them about Stener.  It's pretty bad, but they're hopin' you'll come through and straighten that out.  I hope so.  About my own loan—well, I'll see how things are in the mornin'.  If I raisonably can I'll lave it with you.  You'd better see me again about it.  I wouldn't try to get any more money out of Stener if I were you.  It's pretty bad as it is.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood saw at once that he was to get no aid from the politicians.  The one thing that disturbed him was this reference to Stener.  Had they already communicated with him—warned him?  If so, his own coming to Butler had been a bad move;  and yet from the point of view of his possible failure on the morrow it had been advisable.  At least now the politicians knew where he stood.  If he got in a very tight corner he would come to Butler again—the politicians could assist him or not, as they chose.  If they did not help him and he failed, and the election were lost, it was their own fault.  Anyhow, if he could see Stener first the latter would not be such a fool as to stand in his own light in a crisis like this.\r\n\r\n \"Things look rather dark to-night, Mr. Butler,\" he said, smartly, \"but I still think I'll come through.  I hope so, anyhow.  I'm sorry to have put you to so much trouble.  I wish, of course, that you gentlemen could see your way clear to assist me, but if you can't, you can't.  I have a number of things that I can do.  I hope that you will leave your loan as long as you can.\"\r\n\r\n He went briskly out, and Butler meditated.  \"A clever young chap that,\" he said.  \"It's too bad.  But he may come out all right at that.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood hurried to his own home only to find his father awake and brooding.  To him he talked with that strong vein of sympathy and understanding which is usually characteristic of those drawn by ties of flesh and blood.  He liked his father.  He sympathized with his painstaking effort to get up in the world.  He could not forget that as a boy he had had the loving sympathy and interest of his father.  The loan which he had from the Third National, on somewhat weak Union Street Railway shares he could probably replace if stocks did not drop too tremendously.  He must replace this at all costs.  But his father's investments in street-railways, which had risen with his own ventures, and which now involved an additional two hundred thousand—how could he protect those?  The shares were hypothecated and the money was used for other things.  Additional collateral would have to be furnished the several banks carrying them.  It was nothing except loans, loans, loans, and the need of protecting them.  If he could only get an additional deposit of two or three hundred thousand dollars from Stener.  But that, in the face of possible financial difficulties, was rank criminality.  All depended on the morrow.\r\n\r\n Monday, the ninth, dawned gray and cheerless.  He was up with the first ray of light, shaved and dressed, and went over, under the gray-green pergola, to his father's house.  He was up, also, and stirring about, for he had not been able to sleep.  His gray eyebrows and gray hair looked rather shaggy and disheveled, and his side-whiskers anything but decorative.  The old gentleman's eyes were tired, and his face was gray.  Cowperwood could see that he was worrying.  He looked up from a small, ornate escritoire of buhl, which Ellsworth had found somewhere, and where he was quietly tabulating a list of his resources and liabilities.  Cowperwood winced.  He hated to see his father worried, but he could not help it.  He had hoped sincerely, when they built their houses together, that the days of worry for his father had gone forever.\r\n\r\n \"Counting up?\"  he asked, familiarly, with a smile.  He wanted to hearten the old gentleman as much as possible.\r\n\r\n \"I was just running over my affairs again to see where I stood in case—\" He looked quizzically at his son, and Frank smiled again.\r\n\r\n \"I wouldn't worry, father.  I told you how I fixed it so that Butler and that crowd will support the market.  I have Rivers and Targool and Harry Eltinge on 'change helping me sell out, and they are the best men there.  They'll handle the situation carefully.  I couldn't trust Ed or Joe in this case, for the moment they began to sell everybody would know what was going on with me.  This way my men will seem like bears hammering the market, but not hammering too hard.  I ought to be able to unload enough at ten points off to raise five hundred thousand.  The market may not go lower than that.  You can't tell.  It isn't going to sink indefinitely.  If I just knew what the big insurance companies were going to do!  The morning paper hasn't come yet, has it?\"\r\n\r\n He was going to pull a bell, but remembered that the servants would scarcely be up as yet.  He went to the front door himself.  There were the Press and the Public Ledger lying damp from the presses.  He picked them up and glanced at the front pages.  His countenance fell.  On one, the Press, was spread a great black map of Chicago, a most funereal-looking thing, the black portion indicating the burned section.  He had never seen a map of Chicago before in just this clear, definite way.  That white portion was Lake Michigan, and there was the Chicago River dividing the city into three almost equal portions—the north side, the west side, the south side.  He saw at once that the city was curiously arranged, somewhat like Philadelphia, and that the business section was probably an area of two or three miles square, set at the juncture of the three sides, and lying south of the main stem of the river, where it flowed into the lake after the southwest and northwest branches had united to form it.  This was a significant central area;  but, according to this map, it was all burned out.  \"Chicago in Ashes\" ran a great side-heading set in heavily leaded black type.  It went on to detail the sufferings of the homeless, the number of the dead, the number of those whose fortunes had been destroyed.  Then it descanted upon the probable effect in the East.  Insurance companies and manufacturers might not be able to meet the great strain of all this.\r\n\r\n \"Damn!\"  said Cowperwood gloomily.  \"I wish I were out of this stock-jobbing business.  I wish I had never gotten into it.\"  He returned to his drawing-room and scanned both accounts most carefully.\r\n\r\n Then, though it was still early, he and his father drove to his office.  There were already messages awaiting him, a dozen or more, to cancel or sell.  While he was standing there a messenger-boy brought him three more.  One was from Stener and said that he would be back by twelve o'clock, the very earliest he could make it.  Cowperwood was relieved and yet distressed.  He would need large sums of money to meet various loans before three.  Every hour was precious.  He must arrange to meet Stener at the station and talk to him before any one else should see him.  Clearly this was going to be a hard, dreary, strenuous day.\r\n\r\n Third Street, by the time he reached there, was stirring with other bankers and brokers called forth by the exigencies of the occasion.  There was a suspicious hurrying of feet—that intensity which makes all the difference in the world between a hundred people placid and a hundred people disturbed.  At the exchange, the atmosphere was feverish. "

        "text":" You've let a single message from Mollenhauer frighten you to death, and because of that you're going to risk your fortune, your reputation, your standing—everything.  Do you really realize what this means if I fail?  You will be a convict, I tell you, George.  You will go to prison.  This fellow Mollenhauer, who is so quick to tell you what not to do now, will be the last man to turn a hand for you once you're down.  Why, look at me—I've helped you, haven't I?  Haven't I handled your affairs satisfactorily for you up to now?  What in Heaven's name has got into you?  What have you to be afraid of?\"\r\n\r\n Stener was just about to make another weak rejoinder when the door from the outer office opened, and Albert Stires, Stener's chief clerk, entered.  Stener was too flustered to really pay any attention to Stires for the moment;  but Cowperwood took matters in his own hands.\r\n\r\n \"What is it, Albert?\"  he asked, familiarly.\r\n\r\n \"Mr.  Sengstack from Mr. Mollenhauer to see Mr. Stener.\"\r\n\r\n At the sound of this dreadful name Stener wilted like a leaf.  Cowperwood saw it.  He realized that his last hope of getting the three hundred thousand dollars was now probably gone.  Still he did not propose to give up as yet.\r\n\r\n \"Well, George,\" he said, after Albert had gone out with instructions that Stener would see Sengstack in a moment.  \"I see how it is.  This man has got you mesmerized.  You can't act for yourself now— you're too frightened.  I'll let it rest for the present;  I'll come back.  But for Heaven's sake pull yourself together.  Think what it means.  I'm telling you exactly what's going to happen if you don't.  You'll be independently rich if you do.  You'll be a convict if you don't.\"\r\n\r\n And deciding he would make one more effort in the street before seeing Butler again, he walked out briskly, jumped into his light spring runabout waiting outside—a handsome little yellow-glazed vehicle, with a yellow leather cushion seat, drawn by a young, high-stepping bay mare—and sent her scudding from door to door, throwing down the lines indifferently and bounding up the steps of banks and into office doors.\r\n\r\n But all without avail.  All were interested, considerate;  but things were very uncertain.  The Girard National Bank refused an hour's grace, and he had to send a large bundle of his most valuable securities to cover his stock shrinkage there.  Word came from his father at two that as president of the Third National he would have to call for his one hundred and fifty thousand dollars due there.  The directors were suspicious of his stocks.  He at once wrote a check against fifty thousand dollars of his deposits in that bank, took twenty-five thousand of his available office funds, called a loan of fifty thousand against Tighe & Co., and sold sixty thousand Green & Coates, a line he had been tentatively dabbling in, for one-third their value—and, combining the general results, sent them all to the Third National.  His father was immensely relieved from one point of view, but sadly depressed from another.  He hurried out at the noon-hour to see what his own holdings would bring.  He was compromising himself in a way by doing it, but his parental heart, as well as is own financial interests, were involved.  By mortgaging his house and securing loans on his furniture, carriages, lots, and stocks, he managed to raise one hundred thousand in cash, and deposited it in his own bank to Frank's credit;  but it was a very light anchor to windward in this swirling storm, at that.  Frank had been counting on getting all of his loans extended three or four days at least.  Reviewing his situation at two o'clock of this Monday afternoon, he said to himself thoughtfully but grimly: \"Well, Stener has to loan me three hundred thousand—that's all there is to it.  And I'll have to see Butler now, or he'll be calling his loan before three.\"\r\n\r\n He hurried out, and was off to Butler's house, driving like mad. \r\n\r\n Chapter XXVI\r\n\r\n Things had changed greatly since last Cowperwood had talked with Butler.  Although most friendly at the time the proposition was made that he should combine with Mollenhauer and Simpson to sustain the market, alas, now on this Monday morning at nine o'clock, an additional complication had been added to the already tangled situation which had changed Butler's attitude completely.  As he was leaving his home to enter his runabout, at nine o'clock in the morning of this same day in which Cowperwood was seeking Stener's aid, the postman, coming up, had handed Butler four letters, all of which he paused for a moment to glance at.  One was from a sub-contractor by the name of O'Higgins, the second was from Father Michel, his confessor, of St. Timothy's, thanking him for a contribution to the parish poor fund;  a third was from Drexel & Co. relating to a deposit, and the fourth was an anonymous communication, on cheap stationery from some one who was apparently not very literate—a woman most likely—written in a scrawling hand, which read:\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR—This is to warn you that your daughter Aileen is running around with a man that she shouldn't, Frank A. Cowperwood, the banker.  If you don't believe it, watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street.  Then you can see for yourself.\r\n\r\n There was neither signature nor mark of any kind to indicate from whence it might have come.  Butler got the impression strongly that it might have been written by some one living in the vicinity of the number indicated.  His intuitions were keen at times.  As a matter of fact, it was written by a girl, a member of St. Timothy's Church, who did live in the vicinity of the house indicated, and who knew Aileen by sight and was jealous of her airs and her position.  She was a thin, anemic, dissatisfied creature who had the type of brain which can reconcile the gratification of personal spite with a comforting sense of having fulfilled a moral duty.  Her home was some five doors north of the unregistered Cowperwood domicile on the opposite side of the street, and by degrees, in the course of time, she made out, or imagined that she had, the significance of this institution, piecing fact to fancy and fusing all with that keen intuition which is so closely related to fact.  The result was eventually this letter which now spread clear and grim before Butler's eyes.\r\n\r\n The Irish are a philosophic as well as a practical race.  Their first and strongest impulse is to make the best of a bad situation— to put a better face on evil than it normally wears.  On first reading these lines the intelligence they conveyed sent a peculiar chill over Butler's sturdy frame.  His jaw instinctively closed, and his gray eyes narrowed.  Could this be true?  If it were not, would the author of the letter say so practically, \"If you don't believe it, watch the house at 931 North Tenth Street\"?  Wasn't that in itself proof positive—the hard, matter-of-fact realism of it?  And this was the man who had come to him the night before seeking aid—whom he had done so much to assist.  There forced itself into his naturally slow-moving but rather accurate mind a sense of the distinction and charm of his daughter—a considerably sharper picture than he had ever had before, and at the same time a keener understanding of the personality of Frank Algernon Cowperwood.  How was it he had failed to detect the real subtlety of this man?  How was it he had never seen any sign of it, if there had been anything between Cowperwood and Aileen?\r\n\r\n Parents are frequently inclined, because of a time-flattered sense of security, to take their children for granted.  Nothing ever has happened, so nothing ever will happen.  They see their children every day, and through the eyes of affection;  and despite their natural charm and their own strong parental love, the children are apt to become not only commonplaces, but ineffably secure against evil.  Mary is naturally a good girl—a little wild, but what harm can befall her?  John is a straight-forward, steady-going boy—how could he get into trouble?  The astonishment of most parents at the sudden accidental revelation of evil in connection with any of their children is almost invariably pathetic.  \"My John!  My Mary!  Impossible!\"  But it is possible.  Very possible.  Decidedly likely.  Some, through lack of experience or understanding, or both, grow hard and bitter on the instant.  They feel themselves astonishingly abased in the face of notable tenderness and sacrifice.  Others collapse before the grave manifestation of the insecurity and uncertainty of life—the mystic chemistry of our being.  Still others, taught roughly by life, or endowed with understanding or intuition, or both, see in this the latest manifestation of that incomprehensible chemistry which we call life and personality, and, knowing that it is quite vain to hope to gainsay it, save by greater subtlety, put the best face they can upon the matter and call a truce until they can think.  We all know that life is unsolvable— we who think.  The remainder imagine a vain thing, and are full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\r\n\r\n So Edward Butler, being a man of much wit and hard, grim experience, stood there on his doorstep holding in his big, rough hand his thin slip of cheap paper which contained such a terrific indictment of his daughter.  There came to him now a picture of her as she was when she was a very little girl—she was his first baby girl—and how keenly he had felt about her all these years.  She had been a beautiful child—her red-gold hair had been pillowed on his breast many a time, and his hard, rough fingers had stroked her soft cheeks, lo, these thousands of times.  Aileen, his lovely, dashing daughter of twenty-three!  He was lost in dark, strange, unhappy speculations, without any present ability to think or say or do the right thing.  He did not know what the right thing was, he finally confessed to himself.  Aileen!  Aileen!  His Aileen!  If her mother knew this it would break her heart.  She mustn't!  She mustn't!  And yet mustn't she?\r\n\r\n The heart of a father!  The world wanders into many strange by-paths of affection.  The love of a mother for her children is dominant, leonine, selfish, and unselfish.  It is concentric.  The love of a husband for his wife, or of a lover for his sweetheart, is a sweet bond of agreement and exchange trade in a lovely contest. "

        "text":"The love of a father for his son or daughter, where it is love at all, is a broad, generous, sad, contemplative giving without thought of return, a hail and farewell to a troubled traveler whom he would do much to guard, a balanced judgment of weakness and strength, with pity for failure and pride in achievement.  It is a lovely, generous, philosophic blossom which rarely asks too much, and seeks only to give wisely and plentifully.  \"That my boy may succeed!  That my daughter may be happy!\"  Who has not heard and dwelt upon these twin fervors of fatherly wisdom and tenderness?\r\n\r\n As Butler drove downtown his huge, slow-moving, in some respects chaotic mind turned over as rapidly as he could all of the possibilities in connection with this unexpected, sad, and disturbing revelation.  Why had Cowperwood not been satisfied with his wife?  Why should he enter into his (Butler's) home, of all places, to establish a clandestine relationship of this character?  Was Aileen in any way to blame?  She was not without mental resources of her own.  She must have known what she was doing.  She was a good Catholic, or, at least, had been raised so.  All these years she had been going regularly to confession and communion.  True, of late Butler had noticed that she did not care so much about going to church, would sometimes make excuses and stay at home on Sundays;  but she had gone, as a rule.  And now, now—his thoughts would come to the end of a blind alley, and then he would start back, as it were, mentally, to the center of things, and begin all over again.\r\n\r\n He went up the stairs to his own office slowly.  He went in and sat down, and thought and thought.  Ten o'clock came, and eleven.  His son bothered him with an occasional matter of interest, but, finding him moody, finally abandoned him to his own speculations.  It was twelve, and then one, and he was still sitting there thinking, when the presence of Cowperwood was announced.\r\n\r\n Cowperwood, on finding Butler not at home, and not encountering Aileen, had hurried up to the office of the Edward Butler Contracting Company, which was also the center of some of Butler's street-railway interests.  The floor space controlled by the company was divided into the usual official compartments, with sections for the bookkeepers, the road-managers, the treasurer, and so on.  Owen Butler, and his father had small but attractively furnished offices in the rear, where they transacted all the important business of the company.\r\n\r\n During this drive, curiously, by reason of one of those strange psychologic intuitions which so often precede a human difficulty of one sort or another, he had been thinking of Aileen.  He was thinking of the peculiarity of his relationship with her, and of the fact that now he was running to her father for assistance.  As he mounted the stairs he had a peculiar sense of the untoward;  but he could not, in his view of life, give it countenance.  One glance at Butler showed him that something had gone amiss.  He was not so friendly;  his glance was dark, and there was a certain sternness to his countenance which had never previously been manifested there in Cowperwood's memory.  He perceived at once that here was something different from a mere intention to refuse him aid and call his loan.  What was it?  Aileen?  It must be that.  Somebody had suggested something.  They had been seen together.  Well, even so, nothing could be proved.  Butler would obtain no sign from him.  But his loan—that was to be called, surely. "
