        "text":" Without any pocket money, or any slice of bread, I lingered.  I did not feel like going to school.  I was late already and knew I would be publicly punished, whipped in front of everyone, and made to kneel out in the sun.  I went to the housefront instead.  The compound women came out with chairs and plaited their hair and gossiped.  It was from them that I first heard the rumours about Madame Koto.  The women talked quite crisply aboutourassociationwithher.They talkedandkepteyeingmemaliciously.  They said of Madame Koto that she had buried three husbands and seven children and that she was a witch who ate her babies when they were still in her womb.  They said she was the real reason why the children in the area didn’t grow, why they were always ill, why the men never got promotions, and why the women in the area suffered miscarriages.  They said she was a bewitcher of husbands and a seducer of youngboysandapoisonerofchildren.They saidshehadacharmedbeardandthat she plucked one hair out every day and dropped it into the palm-wine she sold and into the peppersoup she made so that the men would spend all their money in her bar and not care about their starving families.  They said she made men go insane at night and that she belonged to a secret society that flies about in the air when the moon is out.  I got tired of hearingwhat they had to say and I decided that beingpunished at school was infinitely better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n FOUR\r\n\r\n WHENIGOTtoMadameKoto’sbarearly thateveningtheplacewasshut.  Iknockedbut nooneopened.Iwaitedforawhile.Amanwithonelegandapairof crutches made from flowering branches came up to me.\r\n\r\n ‘Is it shut?  Has she closed down?’  he asked.\r\n\r\n ‘I don’t know.’\r\n\r\n ‘Shame,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n He had sand on his hair.  His face was twisted as though he had witnessed great evil.  The stump of his amputated leg was covered with a filthy cloth.  He looked up at the signboard, spat, and hobbled away.  I went to the backyard.  There was a fire blazing.  Madame Koto’s cauldron of peppersoup bubbled away.  Its steam looked like tormented genies.  Further on, hidden by the bushes, was Madame Koto’s massive form.At first Ithought shewasdoingsomethingquiteprivate,soIlookedaway.But when I looked again she had straightened and was inspecting the white beads which she dug into the ground at night and unearthed in the day.  She emerged from the bushes with a cutlass in one hand, the white beads in the other.\r\n\r\n ‘What areyou staringat?’  sheasked gruffly, hidingthebeads.\r\n\r\n ‘Nothing.’\r\n\r\n She hurried away to her room.\r\n\r\n When I saw her next she was wearing the white beads round her neck.  She came to the fire and threw some ingredients into the cauldron.  The soup made a curious hiss, almost of protestation.  It bubbled turbulently within the cauldron.  Then it foamed and spilledover,nearly puttingoutthefire.MadameKotosaidtothesoup:\r\n\r\n‘Be quiet!’\r\n\r\n The fire blazed.  And to my astonishment the soup became calm, as if it had never been boiling.\r\n\r\n ‘The bar is shut,’ I said.  ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n ‘What happened?’\r\n\r\n She didn’t say anything.  The soup was turbulent again.  It swelled into green foam, its bubbles a little monstrous and glutinous, and when they burst a powerful fragrance came over the air.\r\n\r\n ‘What did you put in the soup?’\r\n\r\n ‘Demons,’ she said, glancing at me.\r\n\r\n ‘To attract customers?’\r\n\r\n She glanced at me again, her eyes bright with curiosity.\r\n\r\n ‘What gave you that idea?’\r\n\r\n ‘No one.’\r\n\r\n ‘So why did you ask? ’‘I just asked. ’‘Don’t ask too many questions, you hear?’  I nodded. ‘Are you hungry?’  I was, but I said:‘No. ’She smiled in a manner that didn’t make her less fearsome and said:‘Look after the soup.  I’m coming.’ But she went.  She shuffled towards her room and as soon as she had gone the cauldron hissed and the soup overflowed.  ‘Be quiet,’ I said.  The soup gathered into a tremendous wave of foam and rushed over the sides.\r\n\r\n BeforeIcoulddoanythingitcompletely putoutthefire,pouredoverthewood,and became little green rivulets on the sand.  ‘Madame Koto!  The fire has gone out!’  I called.  Shecameover,lookedatthefire,sawthesoup streakingthesandlikebatikdyeing, and said: ‘What did you do to it?’  ‘Nothing.’  She bent over and got the fire going again, blowing at the embers.  I stared at the soft folds of flesh on her neck.  She stood up.  ‘Don’t touch it,’ she said, and was about to return to her room when we heard commotion from the barfront.  Two men, one fat, with a bandaged neck, the other stout, leaning on a blue walking stick, were banging away at the bar door.  ‘Madame, aren’t you open?  We want some palm-wine and your famous peppersoup.’  ‘Not yet open,’ she said.  ‘Come back later.’  They looked disappointed and they grumbled about how some people were not serious about business.  But they left.  ‘Troublemakers,’ she said, and went off to have her usual bath before the evening customers began to arrive.\r\n\r\n I watched over the soup.  I got very hot from the heat of the fire and the infernal sun.  I got bored with the soup.  It boiled away quite unremarkably.  It no longer bubbled and seemed to have given up its demons.  Occasionally an impatient customer turned up and rattled the door and I had to go and tell them that the bar hadn’t opened yet.  They all seemed parched and their tongues hung out as they regarded me.  After a while, when I felt sure the soup could take care of itself, I wandered down the paths to ease my own restlessness.\r\n\r\n Steadily, over days and months, the paths had been widening.  Bushes were being burnt, tall grasses cleared, tree stumps uprooted.  The area was changing.  Places that were thick with bush and low trees were now becoming open spaces of soft river-sand.  In the distance I could hear the sounds of dredging, of engines, of road builders, forest clearers, and workmen chanting as they strained their muscles.  Each day the area seemed different.  Houses appeared where parts of the forest had been.  Places where children used to play and hide were now full of sandpiles and rutted with house foundations.  There were signboards on trees.  The world was changing and I went on wanderingas if everythingwould always bethesame.\r\n\r\n It took longer to get far into the forest.  It seemed that the trees, feeling that they were losing the argument with human beings, had simply walked deeper into the forest.  The deeper in I went, the more I noticed the difference.  The grounds were covered in white sand.  Piles of brick and cement were everywhere.  Further on, by the paths, there were patches of dried excrement.  The smell compounded the dryness of the air.  I stood under a withering bamboo tree and a cat appeared in front of me.  It looked up, and went into the forest.  I followed it till we got to a clearing covered in leaves and rubber seeds.  It was very cool and it smelt like the body of a great mother.  Insects sizzled and birds piped all around.  An antelope ran past with her little ones.  I lay down and slept. "

        "text":"I hadn’t been sleeping long when I heard my name ringing through the trees.  I remembered Madame Koto and ran back to the bar.  When I got to the backyard the fire was smouldering, the cauldron had been removed from the grate and was on the floor.  Madame Koto came out of her room and I said:\r\n\r\n‘I thought you were bathing.’\r\n\r\n ‘Bathing?  How can I?  Where have you been?’\r\n\r\n ‘Playing.’\r\n\r\n ‘Where?’\r\n\r\n ‘Alongthepaths.  I thought you were. .’\r\n\r\n ‘…bathing.  Come!’\r\n\r\n I followed her.  She opened the back door of the bar.  The light flooded in.  Lizards scattered from the tables.  A slick gecko inched up the wall.  The bar was a mess.  It was almost unrecognisable.  There was vomit on the floor;  benches were scattered and upturned;  tables were in unusual positions;  fish and chicken bones were all over the floor;  spilt palm-wine stank, covered in flies;  and columns of ants had formed along the walls.  The place looked wrecked.  It had the air of a ransacked and deserted marketplace.\r\n\r\n ‘What happened?’\r\n\r\n ‘Troublesome customers,’ was all she said.\r\n\r\n We set to work clearingtheplace.  I swept thefloor and brushed out alltheants.  We moved the tables.  She poured sand on the vomit and swept it out to the front.  We rearranged the benches.  I sprinkled water on the floor and swept again.  The areas of the madman’s piss were still greenish.  The cross-eyed spirits had gone.  As we moved the tables Madame Koto farted.  I was startled by the sudden voluminous noise.  Her face showed no sign that I had noticed.  She sprinkled disinfectant over the vomit-stains and then she opened the front door for air to come through.  Then she went to have her bath.\r\n\r\n The wind didn’t really come through the bar.  It was stuffy and smelt of Madame Koto’s fart.  I went outside for a while and when I came back in the smell had cleared.  I sat in my corner while Madame Koto struggled with the gourds and calabashes outside.  Some of her women friends came to see her on their way back from hawking.\r\n\r\n ‘My daughter’s husband!’  they said to me as they passed through the bar, with basins on their heads.\r\n\r\n In the backyard they talked about politics, about the thugs of politicians and how businessmen and chiefs sprayed money at parties and celebrations.  Madame Koto fed them and they prayed for her prosperity and they left, their voices low and sweet as they chatted away down the street.\r\n\r\n As the evening wore on the bar stayed empty.  No one came;  I slept;  and I was woken up by a lizard that had dropped from the wall.  I got up and saw a man sitting at a table.  He had a swollen eye and his lower lip was unnaturally thick.  He spoke in a heavy,slowvoice,asifhefoundwordstoobulky torolloverhisbiglip.\r\n\r\n ‘Is that how you treat customers?’  he asked.\r\n\r\n I called for Madame Koto.  She came in and the man said:\r\n\r\n‘Have my friends come yet?’\r\n\r\n ‘What friends?’\r\n\r\n ‘My friends.’\r\n\r\n ‘No one has come yet.  You want some palm-wine?’\r\n\r\n ‘I will only drink when my friends arrive.  They have all the money.’\r\n\r\n ‘I will serve you,’ said Madame Koto, ‘and when they come you can pay me.’\r\n\r\n ‘I will wait,’ insisted the man.\r\n\r\n Madame Koto went out.  The man sat perfectly still.  Then he shut his good eye.  His bloated eyestayedopen.Soonhewasasleep andbegantosnore.Ihadbeenlookingat him intently for a while when I became aware that the bar was filling up.  I looked round and saw no one except the man.  But the bar was full of drunken and argumentative voices, laughter, vitriolic abuses, and the unrestrained merriment of hard-drinkingmen.  I went and told MadameKoto about it.\r\n\r\n ‘Rubbish!’  she said, following me.\r\n\r\n When we got into the bar the voices had materialised and the place was quite full.\r\n\r\n ‘Plenty ofpeople,’shesaid,eyeingme.\r\n\r\n I was surprised;  but when I sat down my surprise turned to bewilderment.  The people in the bar were stranger than any I had seen before.  The group that sat round the man with the bloated eye looked alike.  Their eyes were all swollen and their lips were big and bruised.  At first I thought they were all boxers.  Then I noticed that two of them had only one hand each and the original man had only three fingers.  He wore rings on all the fingers.  They talked loudly but their voices were disproportionately more powerful than the movements of their mouths.\r\n\r\n Across from them sat two men, dressed identically in agbada of fish-printed material.  They both wore skullcaps and very dark glasses.  I was convinced that they were both blind;  but they talked and gesticulated as though they had perfect sight.  On another table there was a man who sat alone.  He had no thumbs and his head, amazingly contorted like certain tubers of yam, was altogether bald.  He wore a wristwatch that ticked loudly and when he yawned I saw that he had no teeth at all, in spiteof lookingquiteyoung.\r\n\r\n There was a woman next to him, whose skin was more indigo than dark-brown.  She kept adjustingher shoulders and did not smileor speak.\r\n\r\n Madame Koto came round to serve them.\r\n\r\n ‘These are my friends,’ the original man with the bloated eye said.\r\n\r\n ‘Where do you all come from?’  Madame Koto asked.\r\n\r\n ‘Here.  This country, this city.  Here we live, here we die.’\r\n\r\n Just as he finished speaking, two albino men came in.  They were freckled, their eyesweregreen,andthey werequitebeautiful.Theireyeskeptshuttingandopening, wobblingfromsidetoside,asifthey couldn’tstandthelight. Therestofthecompany cheered them as they came in.  They smiled and took their seats opposite the toothless youngman.  ‘What do you want to drink?’  ‘Palm-wine, naturally, and your famous peppersoup,’ said the original man.  Madame Koto went out to serve them.  While she was out a very tall man and woman came in.  Their legs were very long.  The rest of their bodies were quite short.  They had small heads and eyes that were so tiny that it was only when they came near me that I could perceive their pin-point brightness.  They came over, stood perfectly straight for a moment, and then, like bizarre actors, they leant over to me, keeping their legs and top halves straight, and said, in voices that could only have come from children:\r\n\r\n‘We want some peppersoup, please.’ I ran out and told Madame Koto. ‘Leave me alone, I’m coming!’  she said.I went back in.  The tall couple had seated themselves at my table.  They sat straight and their knees were awkward underneath the table and I noticed that they had the longest necks I had yet seen on any human being.  ‘Are you politicians?’  I asked.  ‘What?’  asked the man, in his child’s voice.  ‘Politicians.’  ‘What is that?’  ‘You’renot politicians,’ I said, closingtheconversation.\r\n\r\n They kept glancing at me and I found their faces very disconcerting.  I tried to sit there without noticing them when the woman brought out a feather from her wrapper and offered it to me.\r\n\r\n ‘No, thank you,’ I said.  She smiled and put it back.  Madame Koto came in with the gourds of palm-wine and voices erupted in weird jubilation.  I fetched glasses and cups and distributed them round.  When I gave the cups to the men with dark glasses they grabbed my hand and said: ‘What’s your name?’  ‘Why?’  ‘We like you.  We want to take you with us.’  ‘Where?’\r\n\r\n ‘Wherever.’\r\n\r\n ‘No.’\r\n\r\n ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n I tried to wrench my hand free but their grips were very strong and their bony fingers bit into my flesh.\r\n\r\n ‘No.’\r\n\r\n ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n I pulled again but my flesh bruised and began to bleed.  I screamed, but the voices in the room were so loud they cut off my screaming.  I kicked, missed, and hurt my toes on the foot of the table.  Then I scratched one of them in the face, and snatched off his glasses.  Both of his eyes were totally white.  They could have been made of milk.  They were white and blank and unmoving, as if they had been stuck there, malformed, in the empty sockets.\r\n\r\n I opened my mouth to shout, but the man laughed so powerfully and his mouth was so black that I froze in my attempt.  I couldn’t move.  I felt transfixed, as if I were suffering a living rigor mortis.  Then a searing pain went up my spine, ended in my brain, and I woke up to find myself in my usual corner, with the tall, small-eyed couple staring at me.  Everyone else was drinking.  Steaming bowls of peppersoup were in front of all the customers.  They drank steadily and talked in curious voices.\r\n\r\n Thetwo albino menkepttwistingandjerkingasiftheirbodieswereuncomfortable.  They were silent.  The toothless man was also silent.  They all kept looking at me.  More customers came into the bar.  There was a man with a head like that of a camel, a woman with a terrible hip deformation, another man with white hair, and a midget.  The woman had a large sack on her back, which she gave to the albinos.  The albinos unfurled the sack, shook it out, sending dust clouds into the air.  They glanced at me furtively, and hid the sack under the table.\r\n\r\n The four people who had come in looked for places to sit and then crowded my table.  I had to get up for them.  I fetched a little stool and sat near the earthenware pot and watched the bar become overcrowded.\r\n\r\n Amidst all this Madame Koto was radiant with her necklace of white beads.  As the eveningprogressed shegot darker, moredignified, whiletheclientelegot rowdier.  She was untouched by it all, even when the men teased her.  The original man with the bigeye, which got morebloated as hedrank, as if his eyewereastomach allto itself, said:\r\n\r\n‘Madame, come and sit on my lap.’\r\n\r\n ‘Let’s see if you can carry your wine first, before you carry me,’ she replied, with great dignity.\r\n\r\n ‘This madame is too proud,’ said another man in the identical group.\r\n\r\n ‘Proud and strong,’ she said.\r\n\r\n ‘Come and sit with me, let’s talk about marriage,’ said the man whose head was like a tuber of yam.\r\n\r\n ‘Marry yourself.’\r\n\r\n ‘So you don’t think I amman enough?’  asked theoriginalman, wavinghis three fingers for more wine.\r\n\r\n ‘No,’ she said.\r\n\r\n The bar rocked with the oddest sounds of ironic laughter.  The men with dark glasses laughed very hard and banged away at the table.\r\n\r\n ‘Maybethatboy isherhusband,’saidoneofthem,takingoffhisglassesand polishingthem.\r\n\r\n His white eyes didn’t move.  They were so birdlike, so ghostly, that I couldn’t tell what or where they were looking at.\r\n\r\n ‘That’s my son,’ she said.\r\n\r\n ‘Is that so?’\r\n\r\n ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n ‘Will you sell him to us?’\r\n\r\n"

pulling of a trigger.\n What was the level of activity\nin your amygdala one second before?\n But to understand that,\nwe have to step back a little bit.\n What was going on in the environment\nseconds to minutes before\nthat impacted the amygdala?\n Now, obviously, the sights,\nthe sounds of the rioting,\nthat was pertinent.\n But in addition,\nyou're more likely to mistake\na cell phone for a handgun\nif that stranger was male\nand large and of a different race.\n Furthermore, if you're in pain,\nif you're hungry, if you're exhausted,\nyour frontal cortex\nis not going to work as well,\npart of the brain whose job it is\nto get to the amygdala in time\nsaying, \"Are you really sure\nthat's a gun there?\"\n But we need to step further back.\n Now we have to look\nat hours to days before,\nand with this, we have entered\nthe realm of hormones.\n For example, testosterone,\nwhere regardless of your sex,\nif you have elevated\ntestosterone levels in your blood,\nyou're more likely to think\na face with a neutral expression\nis instead looking threatening.\n Elevated testosterone levels,\nelevated levels of stress hormones,\nand your amygdala\nis going to be more active\nand your frontal cortex\nwill be more sluggish.\n Pushing back further,\nweeks to months before,\nwhere's the relevance there?\n This is the realm of neural plasticity,\nthe fact that your brain\ncan change in response to experience,\nand if your previous months\nhave been filled with stress and trauma,\nyour amygdala will have enlarged.\n The neurons will have become\nmore excitable,\nyour frontal cortex would have atrophied,\nall relevant to what happens\nin that one second.\n But we push back even more, back years,\nback, for example, to your adolescence.\n Now, the central fact\nof the adolescent brain\nis all of it is going full blast\nexcept the frontal cortex,\nwhich is still half-baked.\n It doesn't fully mature\nuntil you're around 25.\n And thus, adolescence and early adulthood\nare the years where environment\nand experience sculpt your frontal cortex\ninto the version you're going to have\nas an adult in that critical moment.\n But pushing back even further,\neven further back\nto childhood and fetal life\nand all the different versions\nthat that could come in.\n Now, obviously, that's the time\nthat your brain is being constructed,\nand that's important,\nbut in addition,\nexperience during those times\nproduce what are called\nepigenetic changes,\npermanent, in some cases,\npermanently activating\ncertain genes, turning off others.\n And as an example of this,\nif as a fetus you were exposed to a lot\nof stress hormones through your mother,\nepigenetics is going to produce\nyour amygdala in adulthood\nas a more excitable form,\nand you're going to have\nelevated stress hormone levels.\n But pushing even further back,\nback to when you were just a fetus,\nback to when all you were\nwas a collection of genes.\n Now, genes are really\nimportant to all of this,\nbut critically, genes don't\ndetermine anything,\nbecause genes work differently\nin different environments.\n Key example here:\nthere's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,\nand if you have that variant,\nyou are far more likely\nto commit antisocial violence\nif, and only if,\nyou were abused as a child.\n Genes and environment interact,\nand what's happening in that one second\nbefore you pull that trigger\nreflects your lifetime\nof those gene-environment interactions.\n Now, remarkably enough,\nwe've got to push even further back now,\nback centuries.\n What were your ancestors up to.\n And if, for example,\nthey were nomadic pastoralists,\nthey were pastoralists,\npeople living in deserts or grasslands\nwith their herds of camels, cows, goats,\nodds are they would have invented\nwhat's called a culture of honor\nfilled with warrior classes,\nretributive violence, clan vendettas,\nand amazingly, centuries later,\nthat would still be influencing\nthe values with which you were raised.\n But we've got to push even further back,\nback millions of years,\nbecause if we're talking about genes,\nimplicitly we're now talking\nabout the evolution of genes.\n And what you see is, for example,\npatterns across different primate species.\n Some of them have evolved\nfor extremely low levels of aggression,\nothers have evolved\nin the opposite direction,\nand floating there in between\nby every measure are humans,\nonce again this confused,\nbarely defined species\nthat has all these potentials\nto go one way or the other.\n So what has this gotten us to?\n Basically, what we're seeing here is,\nif you want to understand a behavior,\nwhether it's an appalling one,\na wondrous one,\nor confusedly in between,\nif you want to understand that,\nyou've got take into account\nwhat happened a second before\nto a million years before,\neverything in between.\n So what can we conclude at this point?\n Officially, it's complicated.\n Wow, that's really helpful.\n It's complicated,\nand you'd better be\nreal careful, real cautious\nbefore you conclude\nyou know what causes a behavior,\nespecially if it's a behavior\nyou're judging harshly.\n Now, to me, the single most important\npoint about all of this\nis one having to do with change.\n Every bit of biology I have mentioned here\ncan change in different circumstances.\n For example, ecosystems change.\n Thousands of years ago,\nthe Sahara was a lush grassland.\n Cultures change.\n In the 17th century, the most terrifying\npeople in Europe were the Swedes,\nrampaging all over the place.\n This is what the Swedish\nmilitary does now.\n They haven't had a war in 200 years.\n Most importantly,\nbrains change.\n Neurons grow new processes.\n Circuits disconnect.\n Everything in the brain changes,\nand out of this come extraordinary\nexamples of human change.\n First one:\nthis is a man named John Newton,\na British theologian\nwho played a central role in the abolition\nof slavery from the British Empire\nin the early 1800s.\n And amazingly, this man\nspent decades as a younger man\nas the captain of a slave ship,\nand then as an investor in slavery,\ngrowing rich from this.\n And then something changed.\n Something changed in him,\nsomething that Newton himself celebrated\nin the thing that he's most famous for,\na hymn that he wrote:\n\"Amazing Grace.\"\n This is a man named Zenji Abe\non the morning of December 6, 1941,\nabout to lead a squadron of Japanese\nbombers to attack Pearl Harbor.\n And this is the same man\n50 years later to the day\nhugging a man who survived\nthe attack on the ground.\n And as an old man,\nZenji Abe came to a collection\nof Pearl Harbor survivors\nat a ceremony there\nand in halting English apologized\nfor what he had done as a young man.\n Now, it doesn't always require decades.\n Sometimes, extraordinary change\ncould happen in just hours.\n Consider the World War I\nChristmas truce of 1914.\n The powers that be\nhad negotiated a brief truce\nso that soldiers could go out,\ncollect bodies from no-man's-land\nin between the trench lines.\n And soon British and German soldiers\nwere doing that,\nand then helping each other carry bodies,\nand then helping each other\ndig graves in the frozen ground,\nand then praying together,\nand then having Christmas together\nand exchanging gifts,\nand by the next day,\nthey were playing soccer together\nand exchanging addresses\nso they could meet after the war.\n That truce kept going\nuntil the officers had to arrive\nand said, \"We will shoot you\nunless you go back\nto trying to kill each other.\"\n And all it took here was hours\nfor these men to develop\na completely new category of \"us,\"\nall of us in the trenches here\non both sides, dying for no damn reason,\nand who is a \"them,\"\nthose faceless powers behind the lines\nwho were using them as pawns.\n And sometimes,\nchange can occur in seconds.\n Probably the most horrifying event\nin the Vietnam War\nwas the My Lai Massacre.\n A brigade of American soldiers\nwent into an undefended\nvillage full of civilians\nand killed between 350 and 500 of them,\nmass-raped women and children,\nmutilated bodies.\n It was appalling.\n It was appalling because it occurred,\nbecause the government denied it,\nbecause the US government eventually\ndid nothing more than a slap on the wrist,\nand appalling because it almost certainly\nwas not a singular event.\n This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man\nwho stopped the My Lai Massacre.\n He was piloting a helicopter gunship,\nlanded there, got out\nand saw American soldiers shooting babies,\nshooting old women,\nfigured out what was going on,\nand he then took his helicopter\nand did something that undid\nhis lifetime of conditioning\nas to who is an \"us\" and who is a \"them.\"\n He landed his helicopter\nin between some surviving villagers\nand American soldiers\nand he trained his machine guns\non his fellow Americans,\nand said, \"If you don't stop the killing,\nI will mow you down.\"\n Now, these people\nare no more special than any of us.\n Same neurons, same neurochemicals,\nsame biology.\n What we're left with here\nis this inevitable cliche:\n\"Those who don't study history\nare destined to repeat it.\"\n What we have here is the opposite of it.\n Those who don't study the history\nof extraordinary human change,\nthose who don't study the biology\nof what can transform us\nfrom our worst to our best behaviors,\nthose who don't do this\nare destined not to be able\nto repeat these incandescent,\nmagnificent moments.\n So thank you.\n (Applause)\nCA: Talks that really give you\na new mental model about something,\nthose are some of my favorite TED Talks,\nand we just got one.\n Robert, thank you so much for that.\n Good luck with the book.\n That was amazing,\nand we're going to try and get you\nto come here in person one year.\n Thank you so much.\n RS: Thank you.  Thank you all.\n"

        "text":" 'Well, his name is Dirk Gently.'\r\n 'You've never mentioned him.  Who is he?  Did he say anything else?'\r\n 'He hypnotised me and, er, made me jump in the canal, and, er, well, that was it really -'\r\n There was a terribly long pause at the other end.\r\n 'Richard,' said Susan at last with the sort of calmness that comes over people when they realise that however bad things may seem to be, there is absolutely no reason why they shouldn't simply get worse and worse, 'come over here.  I was going to say I need to see you, but I think you need to see me.'\r\n 'I should probably go to the police.'\r\n 'Go to the police later.  Richard, please.  A few hours won't make any difference.  I… I can hardly even think.  Richard, it's so awful.  It would just help if you were here.  Where are you?'\r\n 'OK,' said Richard, 'I'll be with you in about twenty minutes.'\r\n 'Shall I leave the window open or would you like to try the door?'  she said with a sniff.\r\n CHAPTER 23 \r\n 'No, please,' said Dirk, restraining Miss Pearce's hand from opening a letter from the Inland Revenue, 'there are wilder skies than these.'\r\n He had emerged from a spell of tense brooding in his darkened office and there was an air of excited concentration about him.  It had taken his actual signature on an actual salary cheque to persuade Miss Pearce to forgive him for the latest unwarrantable extravagance with which he had returned to the office and he felt that just to sit there blatantly opening letters from the taxman was to take his magnanimous gesture in entirely the wrong spirit.\r\n She put the envelope aside.\r\n 'Come!'  he said.  ' I have something I wish you to see.  I shall observe your reactions with the very greatest of interest.'\r\n He bustled back into his own office and sat at his desk.\r\n She followed him in patiently and sat opposite, pointedly ignoring the new unwarrantable extravagance sitting on the desk.\r\n The flashy brass plaque for the door had stirred her up pretty badly but the silly phone with big red push buttons she regarded as being beneath contempt.  And she certainly wasn't going to do anything rash like smile until she knew for certain that the cheque wouldn't bounce.\r\n The last time he signed a cheque for her he cancelled it before the end of the day, to prevent it, as he explained, 'falling into the wrong hands'.  The wrong hands presumably, being those of her bank manager.\r\n He thrust a piece of paper across the desk.\r\n She picked it up and looked at it.  Then she turned it round and looked at it again.  She looked at the other side and then she put it down.\r\n 'Well?'  demanded Dirk.  'What do you make of it?  Tell me!'\r\n Miss Pearce sighed.\r\n 'It's a lot of meaningless squiggles done in blue felt tip on a piece of typing paper,' she said.  'It looks like you did them yourself.'\r\n 'No!'  barked Dirk, 'Well, yes,' he admitted, 'but only because I believe that it is the answer to the problem!'\r\n 'What problem?'\r\n 'The problem,' insisted Dirk, slapping the table, 'of the conjuring trick!  I told you!'\r\n 'Yes, Mr Gently, several times.  I think it was just a conjuring trick.  You see them on the telly.'\r\n 'With this difference - that this one was completely impossible!'\r\n 'Couldn't have been impossible or he wouldn't have done it.  Stands to reason.'\r\n 'Exactly!'  said Dirk excitedly.  'Exactly!  Miss Pearce, you are a lady of rare perception and insight.'\r\n 'Thank you, sir, can I go now?'\r\n 'Wait!  I haven't finished yet!  Not by a long way, not by a bucketful!  You have demonstrated to me the depth of your perception and insight, allow me to demonstrate mine!'\r\n Miss Pearce slumped patiently in her seat.\r\n 'I think,' said Dirk, 'you will be impressed.  Consider this.  An intractable problem.  In trying to find the solution to it I was going round and round in little circles in my mind, over and over the same maddening things.  Clearly I wasn't going to be able to think of anything else until I had the answer, but equally clearly I would have to think of something else if I was ever going to get the answer.  How to break this circle?  Ask me how.'\r\n 'How?'  said Miss Pearce obediently, but without enthusiasm.\r\n 'By writing down what the answer is!'  exclaimed Dirk.  'And here it is!'  He slapped the piece of paper triumphantly and sat back with a satisfied smile.\r\n Miss Pearce looked at it dumbly.\r\n 'With the result,' continued Dirk, 'that I am now able to turn my mind to fresh and intriguing problems, like, for instance…'\r\n He took the piece of paper, covered with its aimless squiggles and doodlings, and held it up to her.\r\n 'What language,' he said in a low, dark voice, 'is this written in?'\r\n Miss Pearce continued to look at it dumbly.\r\n Dirk flung the piece of paper down, put his feet up on the table, and threw his head back with his hands behind it.\r\n 'You see what I have done?'  he asked the ceiling, which seemed to flinch slightly at being yanked so suddenly into the conversation.  ' I have transformed the problem from an intractably difficult and possibly quite insoluble conundrum into a mere linguistic puzzle.  Albeit,' he muttered, after a long moment of silent pondering, 'an intractably difficult and possibly insoluble one.'\r\n He swung back to gaze intently at Janice Pearce.\r\n 'Go on,' he urged, 'say that it's insane - but it might just work!'\r\n Janice Pearce cleared her throat.\r\n 'It's insane,' she said, 'trust me.'\r\n Dirk turned away and sagged sideways off his chair, much as the sitter for The Thinker probably did when Rodin went off to be excused.\r\n He suddenly looked profoundly tired and depressed.\r\n 'I know,' he said in a low, dispirited voice, 'that there is something profoundly wrong somewhere.  And I know that I must go to Cambridge to put it right.  But I would feel less fearful if I knew what it was…'\r\n 'Can I get on now, please, then?'  said Miss Pearce.\r\n Dirk looked up at her glumly.\r\n 'Yes,' he said with a sigh, 'but just - just tell me -' he flicked at the piece of paper with his fingertips - 'what do you think of this, then?'\r\n 'Well, I think it's childish,' said Janice Pearce, frankly.\r\n 'But - but - but!'  said Dirk thumping the table in frustration.\r\n 'Don't you understand that we need to be childish in order to understand?  Only a child sees things with perfect clarity, because it hasn't developed all those filters which prevent us from seeing things that we don't expect to see?'\r\n 'Then why don't you go and ask one?'\r\n 'Thank you, Miss Pearce,' said Dirk reaching for his hat, 'once again you have rendered me an inestimable service for which I am profoundly grateful.'\r\n He swept out.\r\n CHAPTER 24\r\n The weather began to bleaken as Richard made his way to Susan's flat.  The sky which had started out with such verve and spirit in the morning was beginning to lose its concentration and slip back into its normal English condition, that of a damp and rancid dish cloth.  Richard took a taxi, which got him there in a few minutes.\r\n 'They should all be deported,' said the taxi driver as they drew to a halt.\r\n 'Er, who should?'  said Richard, who realised he hadn't been listening to a word the driver said.\r\n 'Er -'said the driver, who suddenly realised he hadn't been listening either, 'er, the whole lot of them.  Get rid of the whole bloody lot, that's what I say.  And their bloody newts,' he added for good measure.\r\n 'Expect you're right,' said Richard, and hurried into the house.\r\n Arriving at the front door of her flat he could hear from within the sounds of Susan's cello playing a slow, stately melody.  He was glad of that, that she was playing.  She had an amazing emotional self sufficiency and control provided she could play her cello.  He had noticed an odd and extraordinary thing about her relationship with the music she played.  If ever she was feeling emotional or upset she could sit and play some music with utter concentration and emerge seeming fresh and calm.\r\n The next time she played the same music, however, it would all burst from her and she would go completely to pieces.\r\n He let himself in as quietly as possible so as not to disturb her concentration.\r\n He tiptoed past the small room she practised in, but the door was open so he paused and looked at her, with the slightest of signals that she shouldn't stop.  She was looking pale and drawn but gave him a flicker of a smile and continued bowing with a sudden intensity.\r\n With an impeccable timing of which it is very rarely capable the sun chose that moment to burst briefly through the gathering rainclouds, and as she played her cello a stormy light played on her and on the deep old brown of the wood of the instrument.  Richard stood transfixed.\r\n The turmoil of the day stood still for a moment and kept a respectful distance.\r\n He didn't know the music, but it sounded like Mozart and he remembered her saying she had some Mozart to learn.  He walked quietly on and sat down to wait and listen.\r\n Eventually she finished the piece, and there was about a minute of silence before she came through.  She blinked and smiled and gave him a long, trembling hug, then released herself and put the phone back on the hook.  It usually got taken off when she was practising.\r\n 'Sorry,' she said, 'I didn't want to stop.'  She briskly brushed away a tear as if it was a slight irritation.  'How are you Richard?'\r\n He shrugged and gave her a bewildered look.  That seemed about to cover it.\r\n 'And I'm going to have to carry on, I'm afraid,' said Susan with a sigh 'I'm sorry.  I've just been…' She shook her head.  'Who would do it?'\r\n 'I don't know.  Some madman.  I'm not sure that it matters who.'\r\n 'No,' she said.  'Look, er, have you had any lunch?'\r\n 'No.  Susan, you keep playing and I'll see what's in the fridge.  We can talk about it all over some lunch.'\r\n Susan nodded.\r\n 'All right,' she said, 'except…'\r\n 'Yes?'\r\n 'Well, just for the moment I don't really want to talk about Gordon.\r\n Just till it sinks in.  I feel sort of caught out.  It would be easier if I'd been closer to him, but I wasn't and I'm sort of embarrassed by not having a reaction ready.  Talking about it would be all right except that you have to use the past tense and that's what's…'\r\n She clung to him for a moment and then quieted herself with a sigh.\r\n 'There's not much in the fridge at the moment,' she said, 'some yoghurt, I think, and a jar of roll-mop herrings you could open.  I'm sure you'll be able to muck it up if you try, but it's actually quite straightforward.  The main trick is not to throw them all over the floor or get jam on them.'\r\n She gave him a hug, a kiss and a glum smile and then retreated back to her music room.\r\n The phone rang and Richard answered it.\r\n 'Hello?'  he said.  There was nothing, just a faint sort of windy noise on the line.\r\n 'Hello?'  he said again, waited, shrugged and put the phone back down.\r\n 'Was there anybody there?'  called Susan.\r\n 'No, no one,' said Richard.\r\n 'That's happened a couple of times,' said Susan.  ' I think it's a sort of minimalist heavy breather.'  She resumed playing.\r\n Richard went into the kitchen and opened the fridge.  He was less of a health-conscious eater than Susan and was therefore less than thrilled by what he found there, but he managed to put some roll-mop herrings, some yoghurt, some rice and some oranges on a tray without difficulty and tried not to think that a couple of fat hamburgers and fries would round it off nicely.\r\n He found a bottle of white wine and carried it all through to the small dining table.\r\n After a minute or two Susan joined him there.  She was at her most calm and composed, and after a few mouthsful she asked him about the canal.\r\n Richard shook his head in bemusement and tried to explain about it, and about Dirk.\r\n 'What did you say his name was?'  said Susan with a frown when he had come, rather lamely, to a conclusion.\r\n 'It's, er, Dirk Gently,' said Richard, 'in a way.'\r\n 'In a way?'\r\n 'Er, yes,' said Richard with a difficult sigh.  He reflected that just about anything you could say about Dirk was subject to these kind of vague and shifty qualifications.  There was even, on his letter heading, a string of vague and shifty-looking qualifications after his name.  He pulled out the piece of paper on which he had vainly been trying to organise his thoughts earlier in the day.\r\n 'I…' he started, but the doorbell rang.  They looked at each other.\r\n 'If it's the police,' said Richard, 'I'd better see them.  Let's get it over with.'\r\n Susan pushed back her chair, went to the front door and picked up the Entryphone.\r\n 'Hello?'  she said.\r\n 'Who?'  she said after a moment.  She frowned as she listened then swung round and frowned at Richard.\r\n 'You'd better come up,' she said in a less than friendly tone of voice and then pressed the button.  She came back and sat down.\r\n 'Your friend,' she said evenly, 'Mr Gently.'\r\n The Electric Monk's day was going tremendously well and he broke into an excited gallop.  That is to say that, excitedly, he spurred his horse to a gallop and, unexcitedly, his horse broke into it.\r\n This world, the Monk thought, was a good one.  He loved it.  He didn't know whose it was or where it had come from, but it was certainly a deeply fulfilling place for someone with his unique and extraordinary gifts.\r\n He was appreciated.  All day he had gone up to people, fallen into conversation with them, listened to their troubles, and then quietly uttered those three magic words, 'I believe you.'\r\n The effect had invariably been electrifying.  It wasn't that people on this world didn't occasionally say it to each other, but they rarely, it seemed, managed to achieve that deep timbre of sincerity which the Monk had been so superbly programmed to reproduce.\r\n On his own world, after all, he was taken for granted.  People would just expect him to get on and believe things for them without bothering them.  Someone would come to the door with some great new idea or proposal or even a new religion, and the answer would be 'Oh, go and tell that to the Monk.'  And the Monk would sit and listen and patiently believe it all, but no one would take any further interest.\r\n Only one problem seemed to arise on this otherwise excellent world.\r\n Often, after he had uttered the magic words, the subject would rapidly change to that of money, and the Monk of course didn't have any - a shortcoming that had quickly blighted a number of otherwise very promising encounters.\r\n Perhaps he should acquire some - but where?\r\n He reined his horse in for a moment, and the horse jerked gratefully to a halt and started in on the grass on the roadside verge.  The horse had no idea what all this galloping up and down was in aid of, and didn't care.  All it did care about was that it was being made to gallop up and down past a seemingly perpetual roadside buffet.  It made the best of its moment while it had it.\r\n The Monk peered keenly up and down the road.  It seemed vaguely familiar.  He trotted a little further up it for another look.  The horse resumed its meal a few yards further along.\r\n Yes.  The Monk had been here last night.\r\n He remembered it clearly, well, sort of clearly.  He believed that he remembered it clearly, and that, after all, was the main thing.  Here was where he had walked to in a more than usually confused state of mind, and just around the very next corner, if he was not very much mistaken, again, lay the small roadside establishment at which he had jumped into the back of that nice man's car - the nice man who had subsequently reacted so oddly to being shot at.\r\n Perhaps they would have some money there and would let him have it.\r\n He wondered.  Well, he would find out.  He yanked the horse from its feast once again and galloped towards it.\r\n As he approached the petrol station he noticed a car parked there at an arrogant angle.  The angle made it quite clear that the car was not there for anything so mundane as to have petrol put into it, and was much too important to park itself neatly out of the way.  Any other car that arrived for petrol would just have to manoeuvre around it as best it could.  The car was white with stripes and badges and important looking lights.\r\n Arriving at the forecourt the Monk dismounted and tethered his horse to a pump.  He walked towards the small shop building and saw that inside it there was a man with his back to him wearing a dark blue uniform and a peaked cap.  The man was dancing up and down and twisting his fingers in his ears, and this was clearly making a deep impression on the man behind the till.\r\n The Monk watched in transfixed awe.  The man, he believed with an instant effortlessness which would have impressed even a Scientologist, must be a God of some kind to arouse such fervour.  He waited with bated breath to worship him.  In a moment the man turned around and walked out of the shop, saw the Monk and stopped dead.\r\n The Monk realised that the God must be waiting for him to make an act of worship, so he reverently danced up and down twisting his fingers in his ears.\r\n His God stared at him for a moment, caught hold of him, twisted him round, slammed him forward spreadeagled over the car and frisked him for weapons.\r\n Dirk burst into the flat like a small podgy tornado.\r\n 'Miss Way,' he said, grasping her slightly unwilling hand and doffing his absurd hat, 'it is the most inexpressible pleasure to meet you, but also the matter of the deepest regret that the occasion of our meeting should be one of such great sorrow and one which bids me extend to you my most profound sympathy and commiseration.  I ask you to believe me that I would not intrude upon your private grief for all the world if it were not on a matter of the gravest moment and magnitude.\r\n"

Then she turned to me, a curious gleam in her eyes.\r\n\r\n ‘Why?’\r\n\r\n ‘So we can take him with us.’\r\n\r\n ‘To where?’\r\n\r\n ‘Many places.’\r\n\r\n ‘For how much?’\r\n\r\n ‘As much as you want.’\r\n\r\n ‘You have plenty of money?’\r\n\r\n ‘Too much.’\r\n\r\n The silence in the bar was incredible.  Then the midget laughed.  He laughed like a goat.  The tall man with small eyes laughed as well.  He sounded like a hyena.\r\n\r\n ‘Name your price, Madame.’\r\n\r\n Madame Koto looked at the customers as if seeing them for the first time.\r\n\r\n ‘Any more palm-wine for anybody?’\r\n\r\n ‘Palm-wine!’  they cried in unison.\r\n\r\n ‘And peppersoup!’\r\n\r\n And they all burst out laughing and resumed their vociferous conversations as if nothinghad happened.\r\n\r\n MadameKotoservedthemandthey drankandateandkeptaskingformore.They drank a great deal and didn’t get drunk.  They sat, all of them, drinking and talking as if the wine were water.  It was only the two men in dark glasses who got drunk.  They kept polishing their glasses.  One of them even brought out an eye and polished it and blew on it and dipped it into his palm-wine and pushed it back into his red eye-socket.  Then he put his glasses back on.  They chewed and swallowed their chicken bones.  They ate and drank so much that Madame Koto began to despair.  She had run out of wine and food and the night hadn’t even properly set in.  As she bustled up and down, starting a new fire, making hurried arrangements for more palm-wine, the midget cameup tome.Smilingvery expansively,hesaid:\r\n\r\n‘Take this.  You might need it.’\r\n\r\n It was a little pen-knife.  I put it in my pocket and forgot all about it.  Then he went to the backyard.  I heard him urinating in the bushes.  He came back, smiling, and left without a word, and without paying.  I told Madame Koto about it and she said:\r\n\r\n‘What midget?’\r\n\r\n I went back to the bar.  I sat down.  The tall man said:\r\n\r\n‘Come with me.’\r\n\r\n ‘To where?’\r\n\r\n ‘I will take you round the world.  On foot.  I make all my journeys on foot.  Like a camel.’\r\n\r\n ‘No.’\r\n\r\n ‘If you don’t come with me I will take you by force.’\r\n\r\n ‘You can’t.’\r\n\r\n He smiled.  The woman smiled as well.  I decided they were more drunk than I had thought and ignored them.\r\n\r\n The bar was so full of people that there were no seats left.  Some of them sat on the floor.  I was nudged off my stool.  The smells in the bar became terrible and strange, the smells of corpses and rain and oregano, of mangoes and rotting meat, of incense and goats’ hair.  And then, suddenly, I found I could no longer understand what anybody wassaying.They allspokeasifthey hadknownoneanotherforalongtime.  They spoke in alien languages and occasionally pointed at Madame Koto’s fetish.  It seemed to amuse them.  Then they glanced at me, made calculations with their fingers, laughed, drank, became solemn, and looked at me again.\r\n\r\n Madame Koto came in and announced that her supply of food and wine was finished.  She demanded that they pay up and leave her bar.  A great chorus of disappointment rose from the clientele.\r\n\r\n ‘Pay andgo,’MadameKotosaid. ‘Pay up andgo.Iamclosingup forthenight.’\r\n\r\n No one paid her much attention.  Her temper rising, she stormed out of the bar.  The voices grew rowdier, wilder.  Previously I had heard the voices before the people had materialised. "

We think this document leaking technology will effectively raise standards around the globe.  We expect it to encourage citizens aware of consequentially unethical behavior to don the hat of brave whistleblower, even if they have never done so before.\r\n Notes\r\n\r\n ↑ Malaria once prevailed throughout the United States and southern Canada (Bruce-Chwatt, 1988).  As recently as 1890, the census recorded more than 7,000 malaria deaths per 100,000 people across the American South and more than 1,000 malaria deaths per 100,000 people in states such as Michigan and Illinois.  It is important to note that diagnoses and reporting did not meet today's standards.  By 1930, malaria had been controlled in the northern and western United States and generally caused fewer than 25 deaths per 100,000 people in the South.fwh  In 1970, the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Advisory Panel on Malaria recommended that the United States be included in the WHO official register of areas where malaria had been eradicated.  In Canada, vivax malaria became widespread at the end of the 18th century, when refugees from the southern United States settled in large numbers as far north as \"the Huron\" in the aftermath of the American War of Independence.  Malaria was further spread with the building of the Rideau Canal (1826-1832) (Duncan, 1996).  By the middle of the 19th century, malaria extended as far north as 50°N.  In 1873, the great malarious district of western Ontario was only a fraction of a large endemic area, extending between Ontario and the state of Michigan.\r\n http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/facts.htm\r\n http://www.rbm.who.int/cmc_upload/0/000/015/367/RBMInfosheet_6.htm\r\n http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol6no1/reiter.htm"

        "text":"Most technologies go through a stage when everything seems possible.  Personal computers in the early 1980s, the internet in the late 1990s and mobile apps around the beginning of this decade were like that.\r\n The internet of things still looks promising, with vendors and analysts forecasting billions of connected devices that will solve all sorts of problems in homes and enterprises.  But the seams are starting to show on this one, too.  As promising as the technology is, it has some shortcomings.  Here are a few.\r\n Bad data\r\nAs much as 40 percent of data from IoT sensors may be wrong, redundant or useless by the time it gets to the cloud, according to General Electric.  That makes data collection and processing harder.\r\n Harsh environments raise the odds that a sensor will generate bad information: Weather, vandalism and pests are among the many dangers.  For better results, enterprise IoT users may need to calibrate their sensors, install redundant nodes or use one type of sensing device, like a camera, to monitor another.\r\n Artificial intelligence can help solve the problem by weighing inputs from multiple sensors to reach accurate conclusions.  For example, doctors can monitor a patient with wearables that measure different vital signs and can be checked against each other. \r\n Insecure consumer devices\r\nMany home IoT devices ship with security holes, and those that don’t will probably get them eventually.  And it’s not enough to send out patches and ask owners to install them, because most won’t, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group warned in a report issued late last year.\r\n This means two things: IoT devices attract hackers, because they’re plentiful and overlooked, and it’s up to vendors to build in security and allow for automatic over-the-air updates.\r\n Changing technology\r\nIoT is still a moving target, and it will be for a while yet.  That makes it hard to choose technologies, because some may not survive for the long haul.\r\n Some specifications that are only a few years old, like IoTivity and AllJoyn, are already merging.  Having fewer standards is probably a good thing, and vendors will try to make the old work with the new, but consolidation may still hold surprises.\r\n Low-power, wide-area networks raise this issue, too.  There are many to choose from now, but analysts say there probably won’t be enough of a market for all in the long run.  While the towers might not come down before it’s time to replace the devices that use them, a network in survival mode won’t be expanding, either.  So for now, it’s best to proceed with caution.\r\n You can't just plug it in\r\nConnecting a bunch of machines and suddenly getting automation and business insights sounds great, but IoT doesn’t work that way.\r\n Because it crosses the line between computing systems and physical infrastructure, like machine tools and air conditioners, IoT forces IT to collaborate with operations people they may not even know.  In fact, a Technalysis survey last year found operations departments were in charge of IoT projects more often than IT shops.\r\n Data collection projects need to go hand in hand with analytics, including knowing what questions to ask and which tools can answer them.  Haste can cause more confusion than convenience: Fifty-one percent of enterprises Strategy Analytics surveyed weren’t sure whether IoT was paying off."

        "text":"Sometimes he left a few worthless belongings in the factory dormitory, to make it look like he’d be coming back.  And then he simply changed his cell phone number, started work at the new job, and avoided everybody from the old company.  In Chaonan, he had done this three times, at three different bra ring factories, all of which were located in the same neighborhood. \r\n  “Don’t people get angry about this?”  I asked. \r\n  “Of course!”  he said.  “But by the time they figure it out, they can’t do anything about it.  That’s why you can’t tell them ahead of time.  If you do, they’ll try to find some way to make you stay, probably by withholding salary or threatening you or something.” \r\n  “What if the new job turns out to be bad and you want to go back?” \r\n  “Well, that’s a problem,” he said with a grin.  He told me his last jump had been easier, because Lishui is located hundreds of miles from Chaonan.  This allowed him to maintain the fiction that he might eventually return to the old job.  Every now and then, Master Luo popped his previous SIM card into a cell phone, used the old number, and telephoned the former boss, explaining that unfortunately he was still in Hubei because of a serious illness in his family.  This was the kind of solution that’s propagated in Chinese self-help books like Square and Round — if a lie works, fine;  otherwise just burn the bridges.  Nobody thinks long-term in a development zone, and nobody looks backward.  “Going to a new job is like gambling,” Master Luo explained.  “You leave and you hope that the new factory does well.  If it doesn’t, then you probably can’t go back to the old job and the old life.  What’s in the past stays in the past.”\r\n \r\n  LISHUI WAS THE FIRST place where Master Luo gambled and lost.  Boss Gao and Boss Wang gave the technician a raise from his previous job, and they promised more money if the factory succeeded.  But after they ran into financial problems, they reduced Master Luo’s salary, and then they stopped paying him at all.  Perversely, this was the most effective way of preventing him from jumping to another job.  If they continued to give a lower salary, he’d probably abandon the factory, but he was less likely to leave if he was owed significant cash.  All summer long, at the end of every month, Boss Gao and Boss Wang made excuses and promises, hoping their debt would keep Master Luo in Lishui.  They were desperate not to lose him — he was the only employee who understood the Machine. \r\n  In development zones in southern China, summer is often a sluggish time.  For many factories, the production schedule picks up in the fall, to prepare for the Christmas buying season in America and Europe.  But weather also has something to do with the annual slowdown.  Most Chinese factories lack air-conditioning, and summers in the south are brutal;  it’s hard to imagine anything worse than laboring on a pleather assembly line in mid-July.  Workers become languid and bosses lose their motivation;  construction crews seek out shade.  When I visited Lishui that summer, work on Suisong Road had slowed to a near halt.  The sidewalk remained unfinished;  piles of paving stones baked in the sun.  A malaise seemed to have settled over the district, reducing everybody to half speed. \r\n  At the bra ring factory, the product wasn’t tied to Christmas schedules, and their problems went far beyond uncomfortable weather.  The bosses looked tense and tight-lipped, and Master Luo said they were bickering about investment. "

Following that were details of her personal life: her husband and her three kids.  And there was a demand. \r\n  The demand made this hack different: This computer intrusion was not about money.  The perpetrator wanted a pornographic video of the victim.  And if she did not send it within one day, he threatened to publish the images already in his possession, and “let [her] family know about [her] dark side.” If she contacted law enforcement, he promised he would publish the photos on the Internet too. \r\n  Later in the day, to underscore his seriousness, the hacker followed up with another email threatening the victim: “You have six hours.”3\r\n  This victim knew her correspondent only as yosoylammer@hotmail.com, but the attacker turned out to be a talented 32-year-old proficient in multiple computer languages.  Located in Santa Ana, California, his name was Luis Mijangos.4 On November 5, 2009, yosolammer@hotmail.com sent an email to another woman with the subject\r\n line: “who hacked your account READ it!!!”5 In the email, Mijangos attached a naked photo of the victim and told her “im [sic] in control of your computers right now.”6\r\n Mijangos had other identities too: Some emails came from christ@yahoo.com; sometimes he was zapotin@hotmail.com.7 According to court records in his federal criminal prosecution, Mijangos used at least 30 different screen names to avoid detection.8 But all emails came from the same IP address in Santa Ana. \r\n Law enforcement authorities investigating the emails soon realized that the threatening communications were part of a larger series of crimes.  Mijangos, they discovered, had tricked scores of women and teenage girls into downloading malware onto their computers.  The malicious software he employed provided access to all files, photos, and videos on the infected computers.9 It allowed him to see everything typed on their keyboards.10 And it allowed him to, at will, turn on any web camera and microphone attached to the computer, a capability he used to watch, listen, and record his victims without their knowledge.11 He kept detailed files on many of his victims, at times gathering information for more than a month, and filling his files with information he could later use to manipulate his victims.12\r\n Mijangos used a keylogger – a tool that allowed him to see everything typed on a computer – to track whether the victims told friends and family or law enforcement about his scheme.13 And if they did, he would then threaten them further, notifying them that he knew they had told someone.  The malware Mijangos wrote was sophisticated, and he told federal authorities that he designed it specifically to be undetectable to antivirus programs.14\r\n In some cases, he tricked victims into creating pornographic images and videos by assuming the online identity of the victims’ boyfriends.15 He then, according to court documents, “used [those] intimate images or videos of female victims he stole or captured to ‘sextort’ those victims, threatening to post those images or videos on the Internet unless the victims provided more.”16\r\n Mijangos’s threats were not idle."

Experimental validation of the framework\r\n Tree healthy subjects, aged 23 to 36 years (two males and one female), with normal hearing and free from\r\n neurological and psychological disorders, participated in the experimental validation of the research protocol.  They\r\n were introduced on how to manipulate the virtual car and practiced the simulator for about one hour to get familiar\r\n with it before the experiment started.\r\n All participants were asked to read and sign the informed consent form before participating in the studies, and were\r\n instructed to follow the lead vehicle, that brakes hard and unexpectedly, “as close as possible” to favorite emergency\r\n brake response by the driver.\r\n Emotiv Headset was then placed on the subject head, and the signal quality was verified, so the driver could start\r\n the simulation.  In this experimental test the “Om Weg” track for rFactor was used, a 47 Km long racetrack released\r\n with the purpose “to race at maximum speeds for a prolonged time”.  Brake Reaction Time measurement and visual\r\n inspection of the braking response was performed off-line on overlaps of synchronized data logs.\r\n Each subject has repeated the car following task two times.  In both the trials the braking of lead vehicle is triggered\r\n by two opposite EmoKey rules, applied to the same Affective metric, that defines two thresholds.  In this way the\r\n leader brakes when the selected metric is above the higher or below the lower of the two specified thresholds, to obtain\r\n a comparison between high and low arousal states.\r\n In each virtual driving session were recorded between 3 and 7 brake responses for each arousal state.  The EmoKey\r\n rules used to activate the brake action of the lead vehicle in the two car following sessions are:\r\nx Long Term Excitement: over 80% or under 20%\r\n x Engagement/Boredom: over 70% or under 20%\r\n Brake Reaction Times are analyzed by a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures.\r\n Figure 4 shows the column plots of Reaction Times in the four different arousal conditions, engaged, bored, high\r\n and low general excitement (left to right).\r\n The averaged RT of the trials within the engaged state across 3 subjects was about 1000 ms and close to the mean\r\n value recorded in boredom.  Both minimum Time Headway (TH min) and RT with high long term excitement vary in\r\n a statistically significantly way respect to the trials with low arousal level.\r\n Even though every subject responded to the brake of lead vehicle by instantaneously pressing the brake pedal on\r\n the simulated car, it seems that they are less responsive to unexpected stimuli.\r\n A B\r\n Fig. 4.

Detaching all trials relative to boredom conditions, after a proper signal processing, we succeed in the\r\n observation and identification of the typical brain response to an unexpected stimulation: the so called Event Related\r\n Evoked Potential (ERPs).  ERPs are brainwave that consist of a series of positive and negative voltage deflections,\r\nwhich are related to a set of underlying components, as the P300, that is known to reflect a higher cognitive response\r\n to unexpected or cognitively salient stimuli.\r\n Figure 6 shows the ERP noted during those car following sessions.

Discussion\r\n Simulations are increasingly adopted as solutions for automotive research, especially for developing driver\r\n monitoring systems and measuring acceptability of on-board devices.  There are at least two ways in which\r\n neuroscientific techniques can be used to provide support research in virtual environments.  Firstly, biofeedback\r\n methods in are general useful to assess reliability and ecological validity of simulation-based approaches.\r\n Furthermore, these methods are suitable to enhance the virtual environment adaptivity to the user by dynamically\r\n collecting brain activity and then use it a feedback to allowing the virtual scenario to be adapted to the user’s\r\n interactions.  Regarding the enhancement of simulation adaptivity, different ranges of Human-Computer Interaction\r\n (HCI) technologies and methods can be effectively integrated within Virtual Reality (VR) researches.\r\n Amongst these biofeedback methods, neurosciences provide a new and relevant approach allowing for identifying\r\n the user’s mind state.  However, how neuro-feedback can be introduced into the simulation adaptivity is an emerging\r\n line of VR-related research, that not only increases measure reliability and controls of experimental conditions, but\r\n also provides a consistent solution for implementing adaptive agents in simulation studies.\r\n The neuro-feedback most frequently used in VR environment is electroencephalography (EEG), mainly in due to\r\n reason its lightweight, noninvasive and unobtrusive nature.  However, other neurophysiological methods, such as\r\n Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), are also progressively used as a technique to assess and study brain\r\n activity in virtual environments.  At the same time as these techniques are becoming better understood, their use is\r\n becoming increasingly prevalent in addressing important factors affecting the road safety, as human factor.\r\n Neuro-feedback driven Virtual Reality Adaptive Stimulation could be extremely useful in developing of\r\n psychophysical model of the driver behavior or to investigate the neurological sources of dangerous behavior on the\r\n road.\r\n References\r\n Allen, A.J., Meda, S.A., Skudlarski, P., Calhoun, V.D., Astur, R., Ruopp, K.C., et al.

        "text":"Originally both Boss Wang and Boss Gao had agreed to fund the factory fifty-fifty, and each was supposed to contribute 750,000 yuan, about $90,000.  But neither paid the full promised amount, and during summer each of them waited, unwilling to be the first to spend more.  According to Master Luo, family-run factories are often trouble.  “It’s better to have a partnership between friends,” he said.  “With a friend you can speak more directly.  With a relative, people are more sensitive, and they get angry easily.” \r\n  The fundamental problem, though, seemed to be a complete lack of system.  The factory had no management board, no investment schedule;  nobody cared about legal contracts or predefined protocol.  The bosses had funded almost entirely with cash, which raised the stakes and created tensions within families.  They had sketched the blueprints for their factory in one hour and four minutes.  Their most critical machinery had been designed according to the memory of a former peasant with a middle-school education.  There wasn’t the slightest hint of a formal business plan.  The future customer base depended upon the hopeful distribution of Wuliangye baijiu and Chunghwa cigarettes.  It was hardly surprising that by July the factory’s most liquid assets consisted of a million bra rings packed in plastic bags. \r\n  If anything, it was amazing that they had gotten this far.  The most educated person in the factory was Boss Gao, who had attended a couple years of trade school.  The majority of employees lacked any formal training, and all of them, from top to bottom, had grown up on farms.  Boss Gao and Boss Wang came from rice-growing families;  Master Luo had been born on a cotton plot.  Old Tian, the man in charge of underwire, had once farmed rice.  Little Long’s parents grew tea and tobacco.  The Taos knew wheat and soybeans.  The secretary — she was essentially an accountant, because she handled the books — had grown up in pear country.  A former resident of an orange plot worked the metal punch press.  Somehow all these agricultural products had been left behind, and the former peasant labor now manufactured two inedible objects: razor-thin underwire and bra rings that weighed half a gram each. \r\n  Almost every Chinese factory tells a similar story.  People might lack formal education, but they find themselves in situations where they’re forced to learn on the job.  Most important, there are plenty of them out there.  Of the nation’s 1.3 billion citizens, 72 percent are between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four.  In modern history, the nation has never enjoyed such a high percentage of able workers, and it’s never been easier for them to leave the countryside.  Roads are better;  migrant networks are well established;  the old Communist hukou registration system has become so lax that people can go wherever they wish.  And all of them have been toughened by the past — workers are resourceful and motivated, and entrepreneurs are fearless.  The government’s basic strategy has been to unleash this human energy, trusting the market to build new towns like Lishui. \r\n  But there are limits to how far individuals can go on sheer will-power.  Even with a product as simple as a bra ring, there’s a point at which a lack of systematic structure and formal education causes problems.  And the bigger question is whether Chinese companies can move beyond low-margin products, developing industries that require creativity and innovation.  In the end, this is the greatest contrast between China’s boom and the history of the western Industrial Revolution.  In Europe and the United States, the rise of industry involved radical changes in thinking, and it happened partly because of a shortage of labor.  In nineteenth-century America, for example, there was plenty of land and relatively few people;  anyone who saved a few months’ wages could move west and try farming.  Agriculture and western expansion sapped the pool of able-bodied workers, so bosses made the most of limited labor.  This need for efficiency inspired innovations that changed the world: the cotton gin, the sewing machine, the assembly line, the “American System” of standardization and interchangeable parts. \r\n  In today’s China, though, there’s little incentive to save labor.  Each year the migrant population grows by another estimated ten million, and young people leave the countryside increasingly early.  Formal schooling often seems irrelevant to students bound for the boomtowns, especially since traditional Chinese education offers little besides rote repetition and memorization.  All of it — the high population, the lack of social institutions, the slowness of educational reform — combines to dull the edge of innovation.  Inevitably, any nation is tempted to waste its greatest wealth, and in China this resource happens to be human.  Master Luo’s personal story was a triumph, but he was still making nothing more sophisticated than bra rings, and for every man like that, there were dozens of others who never made it so far.\r\n \r\n  WHEN THE LISHUI BOSSES first recruited Master Luo, he told them that he already had one child and planned to have another soon.  They never met his wife or his first son;  like many migrant workers Master Luo lived apart from his family.  But he made sure the bosses knew about his personal obligations — this was an effective way to bargain for a higher salary.  Boss Wang also had two children, so he was familiar with the bribes and fines necessary to deal with the planned birth officials. \r\n  Near the end of July, Master Luo requested permission to return to Hubei in order to attend the birth of his second child.  But now the bosses were smart enough to turn his financial responsibility against him. \r\n  “You need to stay here,” Boss Wang said.  “It just wastes a lot of money to go home right now.” \r\n  Master Luo explained that the factory wasn’t busy, and he wouldn’t be away for long;  it was important for him to be there when his wife gave birth. \r\n  “You were there for the first one, right?”  Boss Wang said.  “That’s all that matters.  The first child is the exciting one.  The second one isn’t such a big deal.  When my wife had the second child I wasn’t nearly as excited.” \r\n  For over a week they continued this conversation, in the slow-burn fashion of most development zone negotiations.  There weren’t any ultimatums, and nobody became angry or impatient;  each man’s voice remained as calm as if he were discussing last night’s meal.  But the conversation smoldered, day after day, and there were subtle signs of tension.  Master Luo’s face flushed and he no longer smiled as easily.  Boss Wang became less free with cigarettes.  These days he stuttered more often — the bad business weighed on him and now he had the added pressure of Master Luo’s request.  In normal times, Boss Wang would have granted leave without a second thought, but he feared that Master Luo would take this opportunity to flee the factory.  And his worries were well founded: in the past this was precisely the kind of family event that Master Luo had used as a pretext to switch jobs. \r\n  For the most part they negotiated in passing.  The worker would say something;  the boss would answer;  neither made eye contact.  Often it was so understated that I barely caught what they said.  One morning, when I was in the Machine room with Master Luo, he turned to Boss Wang and I heard the word “salary.”  Boss Wang quickly looked away. \r\n  “L-l-l-later,” he said.  “Business isn’t good enough right now.” \r\n  “All I’m asking for is two months,” Master Luo said.  “You owe me three.” \r\n  “C-c-c-can’t do it.” \r\n  “And all I want is to go for four days.  Four days is enough.” \r\n  “It’s not p-p-possible.  We might get new business any time.”\r\n With that, Boss Wang left the room, and Master Luo grinned at me.  I had learned to be careful during this period — I watched myself around Master Luo.  Not long ago, I had invited him to dinner at a restaurant on Suisong Road, where we drank a couple of beers and talked for two hours.  The next day Boss Wang was full of questions for me: Where did you go with Master Luo last night?  Why were you gone so long?  And why are you always so curious about the factory?  In other parts of China, during other writing projects, I occasionally had to reassure people that my stories wouldn’t cause them political problems.  But entrepreneurs in southern Zhejiang didn’t worry about things like that.  Their only fear involved business: they worried that I might be an undercover competitor hoping to start a bra ring factory of my own.  After noticing Boss Wang’s nervousness, I showed him a copy of one of my books, and I printed out published stories from the Internet.  I told him the truth — I had no interest in poaching Master Luo, and I liked writing so much that I wouldn’t give it up for all the bra rings in Zhejiang. \r\n  In the factory, the negotiations continued all the way until eleven o’clock in the morning of July 27, 2006, which was when Master Luo learned that his son had been born.  He received the news on his cell phone, via text message from a relative.  The baby had been delivered by C-section;  the mother was expected to remain in the hospital for two or three days.  And all at once the factory conversation made progress.  Boss Wang agreed to grant leave, and he paid one month’s back salary.  They still owed two months’ wages, an amount that they calculated would be adequate to ensure Master Luo’s return.  He immediately went out and bought a train ticket to Hubei.  He was scheduled to leave in the middle of the night, and if there weren’t any delays he’d meet his son before the baby was three days old. \r\n  That evening, before Master Luo’s departure, I took him to a celebration dinner in downtown Lishui.  We rode in my rented Santana, and Master Luo commented that it was the first time he’d left the development zone in three months.  For dinner he chose a Sichuanese restaurant, where we ate spicy eel and Chongqing chicken and mapo bean curd.  It wasn’t nearly as elegant as the places he recalled from Chaonan days — the Golden Dragon, the Golden Beautiful Garden — but Master Luo was pleased. \r\n  “I wish I were still in Guangdong,” he said.  “If I were, I’d buy a lottery ticket, because this is a lucky day.  In Guangdong they sell the Hong Kong lottery tickets, but you can’t buy them here.” \r\n  I asked him how he would handle the planned-birth officials. "

and CSS is to learn how to\r\n 0:11\r\n code and once you know how to code the\r\n 0:15\r\n next step is to learn how to code fast\r\n 0:17\r\n how to code out your HTML and CSS fast\r\n 0:21\r\n right and to aid you into doing that we\r\n 0:26\r\n have Zen coding now i'm using a free\r\n 0:31\r\n software and open source software\r\n 0:32\r\n bluefish two point two point four it's\r\n 0:37\r\n an HTML CSS jquery editor right plus you\r\n 0:41\r\n can edit many other programming\r\n 0:43\r\n languages too and it's zen code ready so\r\n 0:47\r\n what exactly is encode you can code out\r\n 0:50\r\n really fast using zen code let me give\r\n 0:53\r\n an example we have a blank document here\r\n 0:56\r\n open in front of you and i want to start\r\n 0:58\r\n off with html5 doctype and the basic\r\n 1:03\r\n structure ok so how do i go about it all\r\n 1:05\r\n i need to do is I'm going to say HTML\r\n 1:09\r\n cool in five and then say and show shift\r\n 1:14\r\n and enter just by hitting control shift\r\n 1:17\r\n enter after writing HTML code and five I\r\n 1:20\r\n will get the basic skeleton the bay born\r\n 1:23\r\n you know structure for the doctype HTML\r\n 1:26\r\n 5 very cool next maybe I would want to\r\n 1:30\r\n attach an external style sheet right\r\n 1:33\r\n style sheets ideally should be external\r\n 1:36\r\n ok so what I do is I again we'll take\r\n 1:41\r\n the help of Zen code encoding out the\r\n 1:44\r\n link tag a real fast I'm going to go out\r\n 1:47\r\n here after the title tag I'm going to\r\n 1:50\r\n hit enter and I'm going to say a link to\r\n 1:52\r\n an external CSS file and follow the same\r\n 1:57\r\n control shift enter\r\n 2:00\r\n combination and in no time you know I\r\n 2:05\r\n have the link tag ready I just need to\r\n 2:07\r\n go out here and put the name of the\r\n 2:10\r\n external style sheet so my EXT dot CSS\r\n 2:15\r\n or whatever okay it's also possible that\r\n 2:19\r\n you may want to include a separate style\r\n 2:23\r\n sheet or you know I II only conditional\r\n 2:26\r\n styles then what you do is I'll go out\r\n 2:29\r\n here and i'll say cc-cold in IE and say\r\n 2:34\r\n control shift enter and you see i have\r\n 2:38\r\n an empty area ready where I can you know\r\n 2:41\r\n push in style sheet only for IE right\r\n 2:46\r\n and we're going to get into the details\r\n 2:48\r\n of why do we write you know conditional\r\n 2:51\r\n style sheets right this tutorial mainly\r\n 2:54\r\n focuses on zen coding how you can really\r\n 2:58\r\n code very fast with the same code people\r\n 2:59\r\n after this tutorial you can grab the Zen\r\n 3:05\r\n code cheat codes in the form of a PDF\r\n 3:10\r\n file that you can grab from my website\r\n 3:13\r\n HTTP colon forward slash shower /\r\n 3:16\r\n quality lessons dotnet for / downloads\r\n 3:20\r\n one that's number one dot HTML and again\r\n 3:23\r\n my name is mohit manager right so let's\r\n 3:26\r\n continue with what else can you know how\r\n 3:28\r\n else can it actually aid us right what\r\n 3:31\r\n if I want an empty you know I would want\r\n 3:34\r\n to link it up with an external\r\n 3:36\r\n javascript file yes I can do that too\r\n 3:38\r\n and it's very simple i just need to go\r\n 3:41\r\n ahead and say script\r\n 3:43\r\n and call in SRC control shift enter and\r\n 3:49\r\n people then I just need to go where we\r\n 3:52\r\n have the SRC attribute and say EXT dot\r\n 3:55\r\n GS or whatever is the name of my\r\n 3:58\r\n external algae okay so you can see how i\r\n 4:01\r\n can actually code real quick real fast\r\n 4:04\r\n with my arm with the help of zen coding\r\n 4:08\r\n now let's move inside the body of the\r\n 4:11\r\n document okay the opening closing body\r\n 4:14\r\n tags whatever is inside the body people\r\n 4:16\r\n is actually what is visible on the web\r\n 4:18\r\n page okay for example if I just put the\r\n 4:21\r\n let's say a out here and say control\r\n 4:24\r\n shift enter and you can actually see we\r\n 4:26\r\n get the opening and closing anchor tags\r\n 4:29\r\n with the href attribute let me say\r\n 4:31\r\n control Z all right instead this time\r\n 4:37\r\n going to say a colon link and try the\r\n 4:40\r\n same Keys combination control shift\r\n 4:43\r\n enter and see how the equation actually\r\n 4:47\r\n changes very cool let's say control Z\r\n 4:51\r\n and again and again okay what if I want\r\n 4:54\r\n a div wrapper with\r\n 4:59\r\n three more devs inside okay so let's see\r\n 5:02\r\n how can I actually do that so let's say\r\n 5:05\r\n if I simply say divin say control shift\r\n 5:08\r\n enter you can see it just balance out\r\n 5:10\r\n all right but if I say div with an ID\r\n 5:15\r\n beg your pardon with an ID\r\n 5:20\r\n off rapper okay\r\n 5:24\r\n which should contain in itself another\r\n 5:27\r\n div with an ID of let's say left sidebar\r\n 5:34\r\n so that's all rather header all right\r\n 5:42\r\n mmm\r\n 5:44\r\n Plus\r\n 5:46\r\n our div with an ID of content plus i'm\r\n 5:54\r\n actually creating siblings people the\r\n 5:56\r\n main dev or the outer dover the parent\r\n 5:58\r\n exactly the rapper then we have three\r\n 6:00\r\n more devs inside which are actually the\r\n 6:02\r\n children and the header content in the\r\n 6:04\r\n footer are actually siblings so another\r\n 6:07\r\n div with the ID mmm fota right so\r\n 6:14\r\n creating three siblings inside the main\r\n 6:16\r\n parent div with an ID wrapper so control\r\n 6:20\r\n shifted enter and people as you can very\r\n 6:22\r\n clearly see I have the main div wrapper\r\n 6:28\r\n which is wrapping the three motives in\r\n 6:32\r\n you know which are actually inside is\r\n 6:34\r\n containing it it's encapsulated three\r\n 6:37\r\n motors inside what if I would want you\r\n 6:40\r\n know I'll a list going inside out here\r\n 6:43\r\n let's say an unordered list or an\r\n 6:45\r\n ordered list going inside you can see\r\n 6:47\r\n how easily I can actually make it i'm\r\n 6:49\r\n going to show it you what if I say UL\r\n 6:51\r\n okay and within the UL li is and how\r\n 6:56\r\n many allies let's say into 10 okay just\r\n 6:59\r\n buy a you know writing this way i'll get\r\n 7:01\r\n 10 list items inside the main parent you\r\n 7:05\r\n well so control shift enter and quite\r\n 7:07\r\n clearly i do get exactly what i was\r\n 7:10\r\n looking for and what if i were to you\r\n 7:13\r\n know just go out here after saying\r\n 7:14\r\n control Z and say I would want a going\r\n 7:20\r\n out here so inside the Allies I would\r\n 7:22\r\n want a 2 so control shift enter so you\r\n 7:24\r\n can see how the equation actually\r\n 7:26\r\n changes all right let's say a control Z\r\n 7:30\r\n or maybe simply I would want three\r\n 7:32\r\n paragraphs going inside so paragraph in\r\n 7:34\r\n two\r\n 7:36\r\n three so control shift enter and I have\r\n 7:40\r\n three or paragraphs going inside the\r\n 7:44\r\n dividend ID content okay let's show you\r\n 7:49\r\n one more example what if I would want\r\n 7:52\r\n you well and then a lie inside it\r\n 8:01\r\n with a class taller ok now this dollar\r\n 8:07\r\n is required out here to increment the\r\n 8:10\r\n index ok you'll get what exactly I'm\r\n 8:15\r\n trying to do out here in a minute and\r\n 8:16\r\n then multiply it with let's say a form\r\n 8:20\r\n ok so control shift enter and people we\r\n 8:24\r\n have allies going with the new wells and\r\n 8:26\r\n that you know they have different\r\n 8:29\r\n classes all of them have different\r\n 8:30\r\n classes ranging from class 12 class 2 to\r\n 8:34\r\n class 32 class 4 so this was a case of\r\n 8:37\r\n creating an incremental class so that\r\n 8:42\r\n number one actually increments all right\r\n 8:44\r\n people you know I can go on and on and\r\n 8:48\r\n on it's a you know you can actually do\r\n 8:52\r\n your CSS to with the Zen coding but I've\r\n 8:56\r\n just confined myself to some very simple\r\n 8:58\r\n examples people you can very clearly\r\n 9:01\r\n grab the you can grab the you know the\r\n 9:05\r\n cheat codes from my website which is\r\n 9:08\r\n HTTP colon for / for / quality lessons\r\n 9:14\r\n dot net for / down loads one dot HTML\r\n 9:22\r\n all right and if you may have any\r\n 9:25\r\n questions please skype me up on morehead\r\n 9:28\r\n dot manocha that's my name i hope you\r\n 9:32\r\n found this information useful i hope\r\n 9:33\r\n that wheels up i also hope that we keep\r\n 9:36\r\n
