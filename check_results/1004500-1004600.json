        "text":" We saw the quiet crowd of people outside Wilson's garage from some distance away.\r\n 'Looks like an accident,' Tom said.  'Wilson will have some repair work at last.'\r\n Tom slowed down.  When he saw the looks on the people's faces, he stopped the car.\r\n Inside the garage, someone was crying, 'Oh, my God, oh, my God,' over and over again.\r\n 'There's some bad trouble here!'  Tom said excitedly.  We got out of the car and Tom pushed through the crowd into the garage.\r\n Myrtle Wilson's body, wrapped in a blanket, lay on a table by the wall.  Her mouth was open and a little blood was coming from it.  Tom stood there, looking down at her.\r\n 'Oh, my God, my God!'  repeated Wilson, his hands over his face.\r\n Tom looked round the garage slowly.  He went up to a policeman who was writing in a notebook.\r\n 'What happened?'  Tom asked him.\r\n 'Car hit her,' the policeman said.  'She ran out into the road and was killed at once.  The car didn't stop.'\r\n 'The car was coming from New York,' said someone in the crowd.  'It was a big, yellow car, going about sixty...'\r\n Wilson looked up and shouted out, 'You don't have to tell me what colour it was!  I know it was a yellow car all right!'\r\n 'Listen,' Tom said, going over to Wilson.  'I've just got here.  That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear?'\r\n Wilson took no notice.\r\n 'Let's get out,' Tom said to me and we pushed our way back through the crowd.\r\n Tom drove on slowly at first, then faster.  When I looked at him, I saw that he was crying.\r\n 'That Gatsby, the Goddamned coward!'  Tom cried.  'He killed Myrtle.  He killed her and he didn't stop his car!'\r\n Later, I heard what had happened.\r\n Wilson had at last found out that Myrtle had a lover.  She refused to tell Wilson the man's name.  So Wilson had locked her in her bedroom for several hours.\r\n Just before seven, someone had heard Myrtle cry out, 'Beat me, hit me, you dirty little coward!'\r\n Then Myrtle had rushed out into the evening darkness.  She had been shouting and waving her arms.  Had she wanted the yellow car to stop?\r\n Myrtle Wilson was killed instantly and her blood ran onto the dusty road.\r\n Tom stopped his car outside his house and looked up at a lighted window.\r\n 'Daisy's home,' he said.  Then he looked at me and said, 'I'm sorry, Nick, I should have taken you to West Egg.  I'll phone for a taxi to take you home.  Come in and have some supper.'\r\n 'No, thanks,' I said.  'I'll wait outside.'\r\n Jordan put a hand on my arm.\r\n 'Do come in.  It's only half past nine,' she said.\r\n I shook my head.  I was feeling tired and sick.  I had had enough of the Buchanans for one day.\r\n Jordan looked at me for a moment.  Then she followed Tom quickly into the house.  That was the last time I saw her.\r\n I walked slowly down the drive to wait for the taxi by the gate.\r\n Gatsby stepped out onto the path in front of me.  His pink suit shone in the moonlight.\r\n 'What are you doing here?'  I asked in surprise.\r\n 'Just standing here, old sport.  Was... was she killed?'  Gatsby asked slowly.\r\n 'Yes.'\r\n 'I thought so.  That's what I told Daisy.'\r\n 'I got back to West Egg and put the car in the garage,' Gatsby went on.  ' I don't think anyone saw us...'\r\n I stared at Gatsby, feeling that I hated him.\r\n 'How the hell did it happen?'  I asked angrily.\r\n 'Well, I tried to turn the wheel,' Gatsby began...\r\n I suddenly guessed the truth.\r\n 'Was Daisy driving?'\r\n 'Yes,' said Gatsby after a moment, 'but of course, I'll say I was.  Daisy was very upset when we left New York.  I thought driving would calm her down.\r\n 'That woman rushed into the road just as a car was coming the other way.  I think she wanted us to stop.  Daisy turned towards the other car and then turned back.  She was very frightened.  I put my hand on the wheel, but the woman was already under the car.\r\n 'Daisy wouldn't stop,' Gatsby explained.  'Then she felt faint and I drove home.  I'm waiting here now in case Tom makes any trouble.'\r\n 'Tom's not thinking about Daisy,' I said.\r\n Then I thought for a moment.  What would Tom do if he found out that Daisy had been driving?  Would he believe that Myrtle's death had been an accident?\r\n 'You wait here,' I said to Gatsby.  'I'll go back to the house and see what's going on.'\r\n The light was on in the kitchen.  Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table.\r\n Tom was talking and holding Daisy's hand.  Daisy looked up at Tom and nodded her head.  They looked as though they belonged to each other.  They looked as though they were planning something.\r\n I went back to Gatsby, who was standing where I had left him.  I could hear the sound of my taxi.\r\n 'It's all quiet,' I said.  'You'd better come home with me.'\r\n Gatsby shook his head.\r\n 'I'll wait here till they go to bed.  Daisy may need me.  Goodnight, old sport.'\r\n Gatsby put his hands in the pockets of his pink suit.  I left him standing there, in the moonlight.\r\n CHAPTER TEN\r\n The End of a Dream\r\n\r\n I slept badly that night.  I had terrible, frightening dreams.  Just before dawn, I heard a taxi driving up to Gatsby's house.  I dressed and went over there at once.\r\n The front door was open.  Gatsby was sitting in the hall, still wearing his pink suit.\r\n 'Nothing happened,' said Gatsby sadly.  'At four o'clock, she came to the window for a moment.  Then she turned out the light.'\r\n We looked round the house for a cigarette.  There was dust everywhere.  We sat smoking in the darkness.\r\n 'You ought to go away,' I told Gatsby.  'The police are sure to find out the yellow car is yours.'\r\n 'Go away?  Of course I can't, old sport.  I must find out what Daisy wants to do.'\r\n Gatsby began to tell me about Daisy.  He told me how he had first been excited by her beauty and by her money.  Gatsby had been a young man without money.  And he had no hope of getting any.  One October night, he and Daisy had become lovers.  Then he had fallen in love with Daisy.  And Daisy, a girl who had everything she wanted, fell in love with him.\r\n Life, for Gatsby, became more and more unreal.  He spent hours telling Daisy about his dreams for the future.  And, of course, she listened to him.\r\n Then Gatsby had to go to the War.  When he came back, Tom and Daisy were on their honeymoon.\r\n The house began to fill with the pale light of dawn.  Birds began to sing in Gatsby's garden.\r\n 'I don't believe she ever loved him,' Gatsby said.  'You mustn't take any notice of what she said this afternoon.  She was excited and Tom frightened her.'\r\n Gatsby and I had breakfast together, and then we went into the garden.  The air was cooler.  Summer was nearly over.\r\n The gardener came up to us and said, 'I'm going to take the water out of the swimming pool, Mr Gatsby.  The leaves will be falling soon.'\r\n 'Don't do it today,' Gatsby said.  ' I haven't used that pool all summer.'\r\n It was time for me to go to work.  But I didn't want to work and I didn't want to leave Gatsby alone.\r\n 'I'll phone you,' I told him.\r\n 'Do, old sport.  I suppose Daisy will phone, too.'\r\n 'I suppose so.'\r\n We shook hands and I began to walk away.  Then I stopped and shouted back across the lawn, 'They're no good, Gatsby!  You're better than all of them!'\r\n It was the only compliment I ever paid Gatsby.  But I've always been glad I said it.\r\n Gatsby gave me a big smile and raised his hand.  His pink suit was bright against the white steps.\r\n 'Goodbye!'  I called.  'Thank you, Gatsby.'\r\n Wilson had cried for Myrtle all night.  Then he began to talk to his neighbours.  Two months ago, Myrtle had come back from New York with a bruised face.  Later, Wilson had found an expensive dog collar in Myrtle's desk.\r\n 'He bought it for her,' Wilson said.  'He bought it for her and then he killed her!  He murdered her, the man in the yellow car!  She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop!'\r\n Somehow, Wilson found out who owned the yellow car.  At half past two on the day after Myrtle had been killed, Wilson went to West Egg.  He asked the way to Gatsby's house.\r\n At two o'clock, Gatsby had gone down to his swimming pool with an airbed.  He told his servants to call him if anyone phoned.\r\n No one phoned.  His dream was over.\r\n I couldn't do much work that day.  I got back to West Egg by about half past four.  Gatsby wasn't in the house.  One of the servants told me he had not come back from the swimming pool.\r\n We hurried down to the pool.  The airbed was moving slowly round and round.  There was a little blood in the water and Gatsby lay on the airbed - dead.\r\n As we carried Gatsby's body up to the house, we saw Wilson lying on the grass.  Wilson had shot Gatsby and had then shot himself.\r\n At the inquest, Myrtle's sister swore that Myrtle had never known Gatsby.  She said, too, that Wilson and his wife had been completely happy.  So Wilson was called 'a man made mad with grief' and the case was closed.\r\n About half an hour after we had found Gatsby, I phoned Daisy.\r\n 'Mr and Mrs Buchanan went away this afternoon,' a servant told me.  'They will be away for some time.'\r\n 'Did they leave an address?'  I asked. \r\n 'No,' the servant replied. \r\n 'Have you any idea where they are?'\r\n 'I don't know, sir.  I'm very sorry.'\r\n I felt that I had to tell someone about Gatsby.  I thought of Meyer Wolfsheim.  I phoned him, but he had already left his office.\r\n The following morning, I sent a servant to New York with a letter.  Wolfsheim sent back a very short answer.\r\n Dear Mr Carraway,\r\nThis has been a great shock time.  I cannot go to the funeral, as I am very busy.  I would rather not visit the house.  I'll remember him as he was.\r\n Yours truly,\r\nMeyer Wolfsheim\r\n All that day and the next, I had to answer the questions of the police and the reporters.  The news of Gatsby's death was in all the papers.  But Daisy didn't phone.\r\n Then a telegram arrived from Henry Gatz.  He had read the news of his son's death in a Chicago newspaper.  He was coming to the funeral.\r\n The truth was that Jay Gatsby had started life as James Gatz.  He was the son of a poor farmer in the Middle West.  He had left home when he was sixteen.  For a year, James Gatz had lived near Lake Superior, working as a fisherman.\r\n Gatz had become a good-looking young man, popular with women.  He had gone to college, but had only stayed there for two weeks.  James Gatz was already ambitious - he was dreaming of success.\r\n One morning, Gatz saw Dan Cody's big white yacht near the shore.  Gatz found a boat and sailed over to the yacht to ask for a job.\r\n Dan Cody asked a few questions.  Gatz told Dan Cody that his name was Jay Gatsby.  Cody saw that the young man with the pleasant smile was quick and ambitious.  When the yacht sailed, Jay Gatsby went with it.\r\n Gatsby stayed with Cody for five years, until the old man died.  Gatsby didn't get any of the old man's money.  But Gatsby had learnt how the rich live.  Gatsby now knew what he wanted.\r\n Mr Henry Gatz was already in tears when he arrived for the funeral.  He was an old man and was so upset that he could hardly stand.  But when he had looked round the house, he became more cheerful.\r\n 'Jimmy did well out here in the East,' Mr Gatz said.  'This is where he made all his money.  He was a good boy and he had a great future.  He could have done something really good for his country.  I was proud of my boy, Mr Carraway.  This has been a terrible shock to me.'\r\n On the day of the funeral, it rained and rained.  At three o'clock, the minister arrived.  Gatsby's father and I waited for the other mourners.  After half an hour, the minister began to look at his watch.  We waited a little longer, but nobody came.\r\n It was raining hard when we reached the cemetery.  As we walked towards the grave, I heard someone following us.  It was the fat man with glasses I had seen in Gatsby's library three months before.\r\n As we stood by the grave, I saw that Daisy hadn't sent a flower or a message.\r\n After the funeral, the fat man said, 'I'm sorry I couldn't get to the house.'\r\n 'That's all right,' I said.  'Nobody came to the house.'  The fat man stared.\r\n 'My God!'  he said, 'and hundreds of people used to go there!  What friends!'\r\n CHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n I Go Back to the West\r\n\r\n And that is the end of Gatsby's story.  After Gatsby's death, I couldn't live on Long Island any longer.  I wanted to go back to the West.  I wanted to go back to where we all came from.  I wanted to return to the place where I felt happiest.\r\n I saw Tom Buchanan once more in New York before I left.  When he stopped and held out his hand, I put my hands behind my back.\r\n 'What's the matter, Nick?'  he asked.  'Won't you shake hands with me?'\r\n 'You know what I think of you,' I answered.  'What did you say to Wilson that afternoon?'\r\n Tom stared at me and I knew I had guessed right.  Tom took hold of my arm.\r\n 'Listen,' he said.  ' I told Wilson the truth.  He came into our house with a gun.  He would have killed one of us if I hadn't told him who owned the yellow car.\r\n 'And why shouldn't I have told him?'  Tom went on.  'That Gatsby made a fool of you and of Daisy, too.  But he was tough and he killed Myrtle like a dog!'\r\n There was nothing I could say.  I knew the truth, but I could never tell it.  Tom had done what he wanted to do - got rid of Gatsby.\r\n Tom and Daisy were rich, careless people.  They took what they wanted and destroyed what they didn't need.  Then they went away, leaving others to clear up the mess.\r\n Gatsby's house was empty when I left, and the grass had grown very long.  On my last night, I stood in the garden, thinking about Gatsby and his dream.\r\n Gatsby had believed in his dream.  He had followed it and nearly made it come true.\r\n Everybody has a dream.  And, like Gatsby, we must all follow our dream wherever it takes us.\r\n Some unpleasant people became part of Gatsby's dream.  But he cannot be blamed for that.\r\n Gatsby was a success, in the end, wasn't he?\r\n\r\n - THE END - \r\n Hope you have enjoyed the reading!\r\n Come back to http://english-e-books.net/ to find more fascinating and exciting stories!"

The objective of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether the physical properties and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) juvenile clearwood change in response to different silvicultural treatments (pre-commercial thinning and fertilizer application) in 22- to 25-year-old trees.  We achieved this by measuring short-term mechanical properties and using X-ray densitometry.  The results show that the MOE and latewood density were not affected by any treatment.  The earlywood density and the percentages of earlywood and latewood were affected by the treatments.  Fertilization increased ring width and the percentage of earlywood but decreased the percentage of latewood.  Pre-commercial thinning also increased ring width and the percentage of earlywood, and decreased the percentage of latewood, but did not affect earlywood density.  Furthermore, our results suggest that the MOE of wood is not affected by the different treatments as long as the cambial age and ring width are the same and that fertilization should be considered as a factor that increases the site index where intra-ring properties are concerned. \r\n Previous SectionNext Section\r\n Introduction\r\n As a result of escalating demands for wood, and for various parts of trees for use as biofuels and energy generation, there is growing interest in increasing forest biomass production.  In Sweden, this has led to an increase over recent years, of intensive research aimed at enhancing forests and wood production.  The possibility of harvesting biomass from so-called young forests, i.e. those with dominant heights below 13 m, is also now being investigated further, as are the effects of more traditional silvicultural management operations such as fertilization and pre-commercial thinning regimes.  However, the use of fertilizers in young forests might also raise awareness of problems concerning wood quality in relation to market acceptance.  These problems are similar to those described by Cown and van Wyk (2004) who concluded that one of the main impediments for market acceptance of fast grown radiate pine wood is its low quality in respect of its short-term mechanical properties and the poor dimensional stability of its juvenile core wood. \r\n Environmental factors affect the growth and formation of wood properties both in individual trees and in whole stands.  For example, competition for light affects the allocation of growth along the stem, and competition for water and/or nutrients affects the overall growth rate (Cannell et al., 1984;  Nilsson and Albrektson, 1993;  Nilsson and Gemmel, 1993;  Nilsson, 1994).  Pre-commercial thinning aims to remove trees from the stand to prevent excessive competition between trees while leaving enough trees to achieve high site productivity.  Fertilizer is applied in order to create a more optimal level of nutrition for trees.  Both these operations can thus have significant effects on tree and wood quality, as well as on biomass production (Satoo and Madgwick, 1982;  Thernström, 1982;  Salminen and Varmola, 1990;  Ruha and Varmola, 1997;  Mäkelä and Vanninen, 1998;  Varmola et al., 1998;  Karlsson et al., 2002;  Mäkinen et al., 2002,; Varmola and Salminen, 2004;  Ulvcrona et al., 2007). \r\n The effects of both thinning and fertilization on growth, both for individual Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees, as well as stands dominated by Scots pine, have been previously studied but mainly in older stands, i.e. >50 years of age.  For example, it has been shown that after 5 years, while the initial effect of nitrogen fertilization was to increase total dry matter production per tree and per hectare, no positive effect of thinning was apparent (Valinger, 1993).  Combined thinning and fertilization have also been shown to increase the total dry matter production per tree to a greater extent than the additive effects of the treatments when applied singly (Valinger et al., 2000).  However, the positive effect of fertilization on radial growth and volume growth was no longer apparent after 8 years (Valinger et al., 2000).  When re-evaluated after 12 years, although thinning could still be seen to have had an effect on all the investigated parameters, fertilization only had an observable effect on shoot axes and crown biomass (Valinger et al., 2000).  At the level of the stand, volume production decreased with 37 per cent of the control when thinning was the only treatment, with 10 per cent after a combined thinning and fertilization treatment and increased with 20 per cent above the control after fertilization only (Valinger et al., 2000).  It can thus be clearly stated that, for Scots pine, both thinning and fertilization can affect development both at the level of the stand and at the individual tree. \r\n An increased growth rate can be expected to result in a lower density within the annual rings of dominant trees than occurs in trees of the same age with their growth suppressed (Peltola et al., 2007).  It is therefore vitally important to conduct studies of within-tree properties in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of thinning and fertilization.  Because of its industrial importance, several detailed studies have been conducted on the properties of Scots pine wood, as well as on the causes underlying the variation of certain properties within the wood of individual trees (Sauter et al., 1999;  Mörling, 2002;  Peltola et al., 2007;  Ikonen et al., 2008;  Vestøl and Høibø, 2010).  One important and now widely used method for measuring and analysing intra-ring density is based on scanning with X-rays.  Phillips (1960) first started to use the technology to study wood, when he developed a method to use a beam of beta particles to estimate intra-ring density on Douglas fir samples.  Several other researchers have further developed the method.  The methodology has gained even more widespread use since the 1980s, mainly due to the development of digital output.  Some of the early studies, for example, those by Cown and McConchie (1981), Cown and Clement (1983) and Cown and Ball (2001), were particularly important because they formed detailed investigations of intra-ring density, which were applicable to various practical forestry concerns such as the effects of thinning and fertilization.  Furthermore, the rapid technical and methodological development of methods for conducting intra-ring studies, as exemplified by Evans et al. (1995), have now reached the stage where large quantities of data can be rapidly acquired and the process of intra-ring wood formation subsequently modelled in detail for applications relevant to industrial forestry (Downes et al., 2009).  However, these studies mainly concern plantation forestry. \r\n An X-ray densitometry analysis of the eventual effects of thinning and fertilization on the growth rings of Scots pine trees showed that the mean ring width increased by 14 per cent following fertilizer application and by 40 per cent after thinning (Mörling, 2002).  However, neither fertilization nor thinning affected ring density (Mörling, 2002).  Peltola et al. (2007) investigated a total of 98 trees with X-ray densitometry in order to elucidate the effects of different thinning regimes in trials where thinning was performed when stands were 22 years old.  Before thinning, stem densities were less than 3700 stems ha−1.  No significant decreases in mean wood densities could be found in any of the trial stands, even after the most extreme thinning regimes, i.e. down to "

In fair weather it soothed and charmed, and in storm and freshet rose to the deep solemn growl of thunder.\r\n\r\n The river made a sharp bend as it emerged from the\r\n\r\n Page 196\r\n hills and flowed westward for six miles before it turned south again.  Beyond this six-mile sweep of its broad channel loomed the three ranges of the Blue Ridge mountains, the first one dark, rich, distinct, clothed in eternal green, the last one melting in dim lines into the clouds and soft azure of the sky.\r\n\r\n As the sun began to sink now behind these distant peaks, each cloud that hung about them burst into a blazing riot of colour.  The silver mirror of the river caught their shadows, and the water glowed in sympathy.\r\n\r\n As Elsie drank the beauty of the scene, the music of the falls ringing its soft accompaniment, her heart went out in a throb of love and pity for the land and its people.\r\n\r\n \"Can you blame us for loving such a spot?\"  said Marion.  \"It's far more beautiful from the cliff at Lover's Leap.  I'll take you there some day.  My father used to tell me that this world was Heaven, and that the spirits would all come back to live here when sin and shame and strife were gone.\"\r\n\r\n \"Are your father's poems published?\"  asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n \"Only in the papers.  We have them clipped and pasted in a scrap-book.  I'll show you the one about Ben Cameron some day.  You met him in Washington, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" said Elsie, quietly.\r\n\r\n \"Then I know he made love to you.\"\r\n\r\n \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n \"You're so pretty.  He couldn't help it.\"\r\n\r\n \"Does he make love to every pretty girl?\"\r\n\r\n \"Always.  It's his religion.  But he does it so beautifully\r\n\r\n Page 197\r\n you can't help believing it, until you compare notes with the other girls.\"\r\n\r\n \"Did he make love to you?\"\r\n\r\n \"He broke my heart when he ran away.  I cried a whole week.  But I got over it.  He seemed so big and grown when he came home this last time.  I was afraid to let him kiss me.\"\r\n\r\n \"Did he dare to try?\"\r\n\r\n \"No, and it hurt my feelings.  You see, I'm not quite old enough to be serious with the big boys, and he looked so brave and handsome with that ugly scar on the edge of his forehead, and everybody was so proud of him.  I was just dying to kiss him, and I thought it downright mean in him not to offer it.\"\r\n\r\n \"Would you have let him?\"\r\n\r\n \"I expected him to try.\"\r\n\r\n \"He is very popular in Piedmont?\"\r\n\r\n \"Every girl in town is in love with him.\"\r\n\r\n \"And he in love with all?\"\r\n\r\n \"He pretends to be — but between us, he's a great flirt.  He's gone to Nashville now on some pretended business.  Goodness only knows where he got the money to go.  I believe there's a girl there.\"\r\n\r\n \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n \"Because he was so mysterious about his trip.  I'll keep an eye on him at the hotel.  You know Margaret, too, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  we met her in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n \"Well, she's the slyest flirt in town — it runs in the blood  — has a half-dozen beaux to see her every day.

I think it's another one.  But I must hurry, I've so much to show and tell you.  Come here to the honeysuckle — \"\r\n\r\n Marion drew the vines apart from the top of the fence and revealed a mocking-bird on her nest.\r\n\r\n \"She's setting.  Don't let anything hurt her.  I'd push her off and show you her speckled eggs, but it's so late.\"\r\n\r\n \"Oh, I wouldn't hurt her for the world!\"  cried Elsie with delight.\r\n\r\n \"And right here,\" said Marion, bending gracefully over a tall hunch of grass, \"is a pee-wee's nest, four darling little eggs;  look out for that.\"\r\n\r\n Elsie bent and saw the pretty nest perched on stems of grass, and, over it, the taller leaves drawn to a point.\r\n\r\n \"Isn't it cute!\"  she murmured.\r\n\r\n \"Yes;  I've six of these and three mocking-bird nests.  I'll show them to you.  But the most particular one of all is the wren's nest in the fork of the cedar, close to the house.\"\r\n\r\n She led Elsie to the tree, and about two feet from the ground, in the forks of the trunk, was a tiny hole from which peeped the eyes of a wren.\r\n\r\n \"Whatever you do, don't let anything hurt her.  Her mate sings 'Free-nigger!  Free-nigger!  Free-nigger!'  every morning in this cedar.\"\r\n\r\n \"And you think we will specially enjoy that?\"  asked Elsie, laughing.\r\n\r\n Page 199\r\n \"Now, really,\" cried Marion, taking Elsie's hand, \"you know I couldn't think of such a mean joke.  I forgot you were from the North.  You seem so sweet and homelike.  He really does sing that way.  You will hear him in the morning, bright and early, 'Free-nigger!  Free- nigger!  Free-nigger!'  just as plain as I'm saying it.\"\r\n\r\n \"And did you learn to find all these birds' nests by yourself?\"\r\n\r\n \"Papa taught me.  I've got some jay-birds and some cat-birds so gentle they hop right down at my feet.  Some people hate jay-birds.  But I like them, they seem to be having such a fine time and enjoy life so.  You don't mind jay-birds, do you?\"\r\n\r\n \"I love every bird that flies.\"\r\n\r\n \"Except hawks and owls and buzzards — \"\r\n\r\n \"Well, I've seen so few I can't say I've anything particular against them.\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, they eat chickens — except the buzzards, and they're so ugly and filthy.  Now, I've a chicken to show you — please don't let Aunt Cindy — she's to be your cook  — please don't let her kill him — he's crippled — has something the matter with his foot.  He was born that way.  Everybody wanted to kill him, but I wouldn't let them.  I've had an awful time raising him, but he's all right now.\"\r\n\r\n Marion lifted a box and showed her the lame pet, softly clucking his protest against the disturbance of his rest.\r\n\r\n \"I'll take good care of him, never fear,\" said Elsie, with a tremor in her voice.\r\n\r\n \"And I have a queer little black cat I wanted to show you, but he's gone off somewhere.  I'd take him with\r\n\r\n Page 200\r\n me — only it's bad luck to move cats.  He's awful wild- won't let anybody pet him but me.  Mama says he's an imp of Satan — but I love him.  He runs up a tree when anybody else tries to get him.  But he climbs right up on my shoulder.  I never loved any cat quite as well as this silly, half-wild one.  You don't mind black cats, do you?\"\r\n\r\n \"No, dear;  I like cats.\"\r\n\r\n \"Then I know you'll be good to him.\"\r\n\r\n \"Is that all?\"  asked Elsie, with amused interest.\r\n\r\n \"No, I've the funniest yellow dog that comes here at night to pick up the scraps and things.  He isn't my dog- just a little personal friend of mine — but I like him very much, and always give him something.  He's very cute.  I think he's a nigger dog.\"\r\n\r\n \"A nigger dog?  What's that?\"\r\n\r\n \"He belongs to some coloured people, who don't give him enough to eat.  I love him because he's so faithful to his own folks.  He comes to see me at night and pretends to love me, but as soon as I feed him he trots back home.  When he first came, I laughed till I cried at his antics over a carpet — we had a carpet then.  He never saw one before, and barked at the colours and the figures in the pattern.  Then he'd lie down and rub his back on it and growl.  You won't let anybody hurt him?\"\r\n\r\n \"No.  Are there any others?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, I 'most forgot.  If Sam Ross comes — Sam's an idiot who lives at the poorhouse — if he comes, he'll expect a dinner — my, my, I'm afraid he'll cry when he finds we're not here!  But you can send him to the hotel to me.  don't let Aunt Cindy speak rough to him.  Aunt Cindy's\r\n\r\n Page 201\r\n awfully good to me, but she can't bear Sam.  She thinks he brings bad luck.\"\r\n\r\n \"How on earth did you meet him?\"\r\n\r\n \"His father was rich.  He was a good friend of my Papa's.  We came near losing our farm once, because a bank failed.  Mr. Ross sent Papa a signed check on his own bank, and told him to write the amount he needed on it, and pay him when he was able.  Papa cried over it, and wouldn't use it, and wrote a poem on the back of he check — one of the sweetest of all, I think.  In the war Mr. Ross lost his two younger sons, both killed at Gettysburg.  His wife died heart-broken, and he only lived a year afterward.  He sold his farm for Confederate money, and everything was lost.  Sam was sent to the poorhouse.  He found out somehow that we loved him and comes to see us.  He's as harmless as a kitten, and works the garden beautifully.\"\r\n\r\n \"I'll remember,\" Elsie promised.\r\n\r\n \"And one thing more,\" she said, hesitatingly.  \"Mama asked me to speak to you of this — that's why she slipped away.  There's one little room we have locked.  It was Papa's study just as he left it, with his papers scattered on the desk, the books and pictures that he loved — you won't mind?\"\r\n\r\n Elsie slipped her arm about Marion, looked into the blue eyes, dim with tears, drew her close, and said:\r\n\r\n    \"It shall be sacred, my child.  You must come every day if possible, and help me.\"\r\n\r\n \"I will.  I've so many beautiful places to show you in the woods — places he loved, and taught us to see and love.\r\n\r\n Page 202\r\n They won't let me go in the woods any more alone.  But you have a big brother.  That must be very sweet.\"\r\n\r\n Mrs. Lenoir hurried to Elsie.\r\n\r\n \"Come, Marion, we must be going now.\"\r\n\r\n \"I am very sorry to see you leave the home you love so dearly, Mrs. Lenoir,\" said the Northern girl, taking her extended hand.  \"I hope you can soon find a way to have it back.\"\r\n\r\n \"Thank you,\" replied the mother, cheerily.  \"The longer you stay, the better for us.  You don't know how happy I am over your coming.  It has lifted a load from our hearts.  In the liberal rent you pay us you are our benefactors.  We are very grateful and happy.\"\r\n\r\n Elsie watched them walk across the lawn to the street, the daughter leaning on the mother's arm.  She followed slowly and stopped behind one of the arbor-vitæ bushes beside the gate.  The full moon had risen as the twilight fell and flooded the scene with soft white light.  A whippoorwill struck his first plaintive note, his weird song seeming to come from all directions and yet to be under her feet.  She heard the rustle of dresses returning along the walk, and Marion and her mother stood at the gate.  They looked long and tenderly at the house.  Mrs. Lenoir uttered a broken sob, Marion slipped an arm around her, brushed the short curling hair back from her forehead, and softly said:\r\n\r\n    \"Mama, dear, you know it's best.  I don't mind.  Everybody in town loves us.  Every boy and girl in Piedmont worships you.  We will be just as happy at the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n Page 203\r\n In the pauses between the strange bird's cry, Elsie caught the sound of another sob, and then a soothing murmur as of a mother bending over a cradle, and they were gone.\r\n\r\n Page 204\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n THE EYES OF THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n ELSIE stood dreaming for a moment in the shadow of the arbor-vitae, breathing the sensuous perfumed air and listening to the distant music of the falls, her heart quivering in pity for the anguish of which she had been a witness.  Again the spectral cry of the whippoorwill rang near-by, and she noted for the first time the curious cluck with which the bird punctuated each call.  A sense of dim foreboding oppressed her.\r\n\r\n She wondered if the chatter of Marion about the girl in Nashville were only a child's guess or more.  She laughed softly at the absurdity of the idea.  Never since she had first looked into Ben Cameron's face did she feel surer of the honesty and earnestness of his love than today in this quiet home of his native village.  It must be the queer call of the bird which appealed to superstitions she did not know were hidden within her being.\r\n\r\n Still dreaming under its spell, she was startled at the tread of two men approaching the gate.\r\n\r\n The taller, more powerful-looking man put his hand on the latch and paused.\r\n\r\n \"Allow no white man to order you around.  Remember you are a freeman and as good as any pale-face who walks this earth.\"\r\n\r\n Page 205\r\n She recognised the voice of Silas Lynch.\r\n\r\n \"Ben Cameron dare me to come about de house,\" said the other voice.\r\n\r\n \"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n \"He say, wid his eyes batten' des like lightnen', 'Ef I ketch you hangin' 'roun' dis place agin', Gus, I'll jump on you en stomp de life outen ye.' \"\r\n\r\n \"Well, you tell him that your name is Augustus, not 'Gus,' and that the United States troops quartered in this town will be with him soon after the stomping begins.  You wear its uniform.  Give the white trash in this town to understand that they are not even citizens of the Nation.  As a sovereign voter, you, once their slave, are not only their equal — you are their master.\"\r\n\r\n \"Dat I will!\"  was the firm answer.\r\n\r\n The negro to whom Lynch spoke disappeared in the direction taken by Marion and her mother, and the figure of the handsome mulatto passed rapidly up the walk, ascended the steps and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n Elsie followed him.\r\n\r\n \"My father is too much fatigued with his journey to be seen now;  you must call to-morrow,\" she said.\r\n\r\n The negro lifted his hat and bowed:\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, we are delighted to welcome you, Miss Stoneman, to our land!  Your father asked me to call immediately on his arrival.  I have but obeyed his orders.\"\r\n\r\n Elsie shrank from the familiarity of his manner and the tones of authority and patronage with which he spoke.\r\n\r\n \"He cannot be seen at this hour,\" she answered, shortly.\r\n\r\n \"Perhaps you will present my card, then — say that I\r\n\r\n Page 206\r\n am at his service, and let him appoint the time at which I shall return?\"\r\n\r\n She did not invite him in, but with easy assurance he took his seat on the joggle-board beside the door and awaited her return.\r\n\r\n Against her urgent protest, Stoneman Lynch to be shown at once to his bedroom.\r\n\r\n When the door was closed, the old Commoner, without turning to greet his visitor or moving his position in bed, asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Are you following my instructions?\"\r\n\r\n \"To the letter, sir.\"\r\n\r\n \"You are initiating the negroes into the League and teaching them the new catechism?\"\r\n\r\n \"With remarkable success.  Its secrecy and ritual appeal to them.  Within six months we shall have the whole race under our control almost to a man.\"\r\n\r\n \"Almost to a man?\"\r\n\r\n \"We find some so attached to their former masters that reason is impossible with them.  Even threats and the promise of forty acres of land have no influence.\"\r\n\r\n The old man snorted with contempt.\r\n\r\n \"If anything could reconcile me to the Satanic Institution, it is the character of the wretches who submit to it and kiss the hand that strikes.  After all, a slave deserves to be a slave.  The man who is mean enough to wear chains ought to wear them.  You must teach, teach, TEACH, these black hounds to know they are men, not brutes!\"\r\n\r\n The old man paused a moment, and his restless hands fumbled the cover.\r\n\r\n Page 207\r\n \"Your first task, as I told you in the beginning, is to teach every negro to stand erect in the presence of his former master and assert his manhood.  Unless he does this, the South will bristle with bayonets in vain.  The man who believes he is a dog, is one.  The man who believes himself a king, may become one.  Stop this snivelling and sneaking round the back doors.  I can do nothing, God Almighty can do nothing, for a coward.  Fix this as the first law of your own life.  Lift up your head!  The world is yours.  Take it.  Beat this into the skulls of your people, if you do it with an axe.  Teach them the military drill at once.  I'll see that Washington sends the guns.  The state, when under your control, can furnish the powder.\"\r\n\r\n \"It will surprise you to know the thoroughness with which this has been done already by the League,\" said Lynch.  \"The white master believed he could vote the Negro as he worked him in the fields during the war.  The League, with its blue flaming altar, under the shadows of night, has wrought a miracle.  The Negro is the enemy of his former master and will be for all time.\"\r\n\r\n \"For the present,\" said the old man, meditatively, \"not a word to a living soul as to my connection with this work.  When the time is ripe, I'll show my hand.\"\r\n\r\n Elsie entered, protesting against her father's talking longer, and showed Lynch to the door.\r\n\r\n He paused on the moonlit porch and tried to engage her in familiar talk.\r\n\r\n She cut him short, and he left reluctantly.\r\n\r\n As he bowed his thick neck in pompous courtesy, she\r\n\r\n Page 208\r\n caught with a shiver the odor of pomade on his black half kinked hair.  He stopped on the lower step, looked back with smiling insolence, and gazed intently at her beauty.  The girl shrank from the gleam of the jungle in his eyes and hurried within.\r\n\r\n She found her father sunk in a stupor.  Her cry brought the young surgeon hurrying into the room, and at the end of an hour he said to Elsie and Phil:\r\n\r\n    \"He has had a stroke of paralysis.  He may lie in mental darkness for months and then recover.  His heart action is perfect.  Patience, care, and love will save him.  There is no cause for immediate alarm.\"\r\n\r\n Page 209\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n AUGUSTUS CAESAR\r\n\r\n PHIL early found the home of the Camerons the most charming spot in town.  As he sat in the old-fashioned parlour beside Margaret, his brain seethed with plans for building a hotel on a large scale on the other side of the Square and restoring her home intact.\r\n\r\n The Cameron homestead was a large brick building with an ample porch, looking out directly on the Court House Square, standing in the middle of a lawn full of trees, flowers, shrubbery, and a wilderness of evergreen boxwood planted fifty years before.

        "text":"PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n 2007\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n When he emerges from the bathroom she is awake, propped up against the pillows and flicking through the travel brochures that were beside his bed.  She is wearing one of his T-shirts, and her long hair is tousled in a way that prompts reflexive thoughts of the previous night.  He stands there, enjoying the brief flashback, rubbing the water from his hair with a towel.\r\n\r\n She looks up from a brochure and pouts.  She is probably slightly too old to pout, but they’ve been going out a short enough time for it still to be cute.\r\n\r\n ‘Do we really have to do something that involves trekking up mountains, or hanging over ravines?  It’s our first proper holiday together, and there is literally not one single trip in these that doesn’t involve either throwing yourself off something or –’ she pretends to shudder ‘– wearing fleece.’\r\n\r\n She throws them down on the bed, stretches her caramel-coloured arms above her head.  Her voice is husky, testament to their missed hours of sleep.  ‘How about a luxury spa in Bali?  We could lie around on the sand … spend hours being pampered … long relaxing nights … ’\r\n\r\n ‘I can’t do those sorts of holidays.  I need to be doing something.’\r\n\r\n ‘Like throwing yourself out of aeroplanes.’\r\n\r\n ‘Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.’\r\n\r\n She pulls a face.  ‘If it’s all the same to you, I think I’ll stick with knocking it.’\r\n\r\n His shirt is faintly damp against his skin.  He runs a comb through his hair and switches on his mobile phone, wincing at the list of messages that immediately pushes its way through on to the little screen.\r\n\r\n ‘Right,’ he says.  ‘Got to go.  Help yourself to breakfast.’  He leans over the bed to kiss her.  She smells warm and perfumed and deeply sexy.  He inhales the scent from the back of her hair, and briefly loses his train of thought as she wraps her arms around his neck, pulling him down towards the bed.\r\n\r\n ‘Are we still going away this weekend?’\r\n\r\n He extricates himself reluctantly.  ‘Depends what happens on this deal.  It’s all a bit up in the air at the moment.  There’s still a possibility I might have to be in New York.  Nice dinner somewhere Thursday, either way?  Your choice of restaurant.’  His motorbike leathers are on the back of the door, and he reaches for them.\r\n\r\n She narrows her eyes.  ‘Dinner.  With or without Mr BlackBerry?’\r\n\r\n ‘What?’\r\n\r\n ‘Mr BlackBerry makes me feel like Miss Gooseberry.’  The pout again.  ‘I feel like there’s always a third person vying for your attention.’\r\n\r\n ‘I’ll turn it on to silent.’\r\n\r\n ‘Will Traynor!’  she scolds.  ‘You must have some time when you can switch off.’\r\n\r\n ‘I turned it off last night, didn’t I?’\r\n\r\n ‘Only under extreme duress.’\r\n\r\n He grins.  ‘Is that what we’re calling it now?’  He pulls on his leathers.  And Lissa’s hold on his imagination is finally broken.  He throws his motorbike jacket over his arm, and blows her a kiss as he leaves.\r\n\r\n There are twenty-two messages on his BlackBerry, the first of which came in from New York at 3.42am.  Some legal problem.  He takes the lift down to the underground car park, trying to update himself with the night’s events.\r\n\r\n ‘Morning, Mr Traynor.’\r\n\r\n The security guard steps out of his cubicle.  It’s weatherproof, even though down here there is no weather to be protected from. "

        "text":"As the Sochi Winter Olympic Games draws to a close, number-crunching by Amadeus has shown an increase in flight seat capacity of 150% in the region during the event.\r\n The company looked at air traffic data to Sochi via its aviation analytics tool to understand more about what impact the event has had in Russia and Europe.\r\n\r\n Key takeaways from the study are presented below:\r\nMoscow is the main hub that connects to Sochi.  Among the 1,300 flights to Sochi, 1,000+  are domestic flights and 75% of these originate in one of Moscow’s three airports.\r\n Overall seat capacity to Sochi in February went up by nearly 150,000 seats (150% above normal).\r\n On average, there are 27 daily flights servicing Moscow-Sochi route.  To give a relative comparison on global context,  there are 30 daily flights servicing the New York-London route.\r\n Frankfurt and London were the top two European origin cities for flights to Sochi.\r\n In 2014, 60 direct flights were added from Frankfurt to Sochi.  Interestingly, there are no direct flights from UK/France to Sochi.\r\n During the Olympics, average cost of return flight from Moscow to Sochi is Euro 600.  After Olympics season, the cost drops down to Euro 100.\r\n We checked for return flight prices from Moscow to Sochi – For travel dates of February 21-22, the lowest price in Expedia was $949.\r\n\r\n\r\n However, the same search parameter for March 21-22 (exactly a month later) travel date is costing $139, almost seven times cheaper than the above fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Due to the incredible spike in fare, breaking the flight journey into more than one leg would result in a cost saving.  For example: In an international flight, instead of booking a direct flight to Sochi, a flight booking to Moscow, and an another flight from Moscow to Sochi would result in a cheaper fare.  While this being the case in flight-related scenarios in Sochi, things aren’t looking too positive in the hotel segment. \r\n\r\n Earlier this month, ReviewPro analysed web reviews on 100 OTAs and other sites over the past 12 months and reported that 52% of reviews left against the 81 properties in the Krasnodar area are positive, with 16% negative and 32% neutral.  Also, journalists tweeted about their uncomfortable hotel stay experience in Sochi.  To top it all, on February 20, US Olympian Kate Hansen tweeted that she found a wolf walking in her hotel hall.  She also took a video of the incident and posted in YouTube.  In less than two days since the incident , the message has been retweeted 2,500 times and the YouTube video has clocked more than two million views."
