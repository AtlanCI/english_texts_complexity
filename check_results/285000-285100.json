        "text":" \"You're supposed to wash yourself all over once a week an' I'll give you a clean towel for that.  Next you gotta wash this floor up every Friday mornin'.\"  Cowperwood winced at that.  \"You kin have hot water for that if you want it.  I'll have one of the runners bring it to you.  An' as for your friends and relations\"—he got up and shook himself like a big Newfoundland dog.  \"You gotta wife, hain't you?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes,\" replied Cowperwood.\r\n\r\n \"Well, the rules here are that your wife or your friends kin come to see you once in three months, and your lawyer—you gotta lawyer hain't yuh?\"\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir,\" replied Cowperwood, amused.\r\n\r\n \"Well, he kin come every week or so if he likes—every day, I guess—there hain't no rules about lawyers.  But you kin only write one letter once in three months yourself, an' if you want anything like tobaccer or the like o' that, from the store-room, you gotta sign an order for it, if you got any money with the warden, an' then I can git it for you.\"\r\n\r\n The old man was really above taking small tips in the shape of money.  He was a hold-over from a much more severe and honest regime, but subsequent presents or constant flattery were not amiss in making him kindly and generous.  Cowperwood read him accurately.\r\n\r\n \"Very well, Mr. Chapin;  I understand,\" he said, getting up as the old man did.\r\n\r\n \"Then when you have been here two weeks,\" added Chapin, rather ruminatively (he had forgot to state this to Cowperwood before), \"the warden 'll come and git yuh and give yuh yer regular cell summers down-stairs.  Yuh kin make up yer mind by that time what y'u'd like tuh do, what y'u'd like to work at.  If you behave yourself proper, more'n like they'll give yuh a cell with a yard.  Yuh never can tell.\"\r\n\r\n He went out, locking the door with a solemn click;  and Cowperwood stood there, a little more depressed than he had been, because of this latest intelligence.  Only two weeks, and then he would be transferred from this kindly old man's care to another's, whom he did not know and with whom he might not fare so well.\r\n\r\n \"If ever you want me for anything—if ye're sick or sumpin' like that,\" Chapin now returned to say, after he had walked a few paces away, \"we have a signal here of our own.  Just hang your towel out through these here bars.  I'll see it, and I'll stop and find out what yuh want, when I'm passin'.\"\r\n\r\n Cowperwood, whose spirits had sunk, revived for the moment.\r\n\r\n \"Yes, sir,\" he replied;  \"thank you, Mr. Chapin.\"\r\n\r\n The old man walked away, and Cowperwood heard his steps dying down the cement-paved hall.  He stood and listened, his ears being greeted occasionally by a distant cough, a faint scraping of some one's feet, the hum or whir of a machine, or the iron scratch of a key in a lock.  None of the noises was loud.  Rather they were all faint and far away.  He went over and looked at the bed, which was not very clean and without linen, and anything but wide or soft, and felt it curiously.  So here was where he was to sleep from now on—he who so craved and appreciated luxury and refinement.  If Aileen or some of his rich friends should see him here.  Worse, he was sickened by the thought of possible vermin.  How could he tell?  How would he do?  The one chair was abominable.  The skylight was weak.  He tried to think of himself as becoming accustomed to the situation, but he re-discovered the offal pot in one corner, and that discouraged him.  It was possible that rats might come up here—it looked that way.  No pictures, no books, no scene, no person, no space to walk—just the four bare walls and silence, which he would be shut into at night by the thick door.  What a horrible fate!\r\n\r\n He sat down and contemplated his situation.  So here he was at last in the Eastern Penitentiary, and doomed, according to the judgment of the politicians (Butler among others), to remain here four long years and longer.  Stener, it suddenly occurred to him, was probably being put through the same process he had just gone through.  Poor old Stener!  What a fool he had made of himself.  But because of his foolishness he deserved all he was now getting.  But the difference between himself and Stener was that they would let Stener out.  It was possible that already they were easing his punishment in some way that he, Cowperwood, did not know.  He put his hand to his chin, thinking—his business, his house, his friends, his family, Aileen.  He felt for his watch, but remembered that they had taken that.  There was no way of telling the time.  Neither had he any notebook, pen, or pencil with which to amuse or interest himself.  Besides he had had nothing to eat since morning.  Still, that mattered little.  What did matter was that he was shut up here away from the world, quite alone, quite lonely, without knowing what time it was, and that he could not attend to any of the things he ought to be attending to—his business affairs, his future.  True, Steger would probably come to see him after a while.  That would help a little.  But even so—think of his position, his prospects up to the day of the fire and his state now.  He sat looking at his shoes;  his suit.  God!  He got up and walked to and fro, to and fro, but his own steps and movements sounded so loud.  He walked to the cell door and looked out through the thick bars, but there was nothing to see—nothing save a portion of two cell doors opposite, something like his own.  He came back and sat in his single chair, meditating, but, getting weary of that finally, stretched himself on the dirty prison bed to try it.  It was not uncomfortable entirely.  He got up after a while, however, and sat, then walked, then sat.  What a narrow place to walk, he thought.  This was horrible—something like a living tomb.  And to think he should be here now, day after day and day after day, until—until what?  Until the Governor pardoned him or his time was up, or his fortune eaten away—or—\r\n\r\n So he cogitated while the hours slipped by.  It was nearly five o'clock before Steger was able to return, and then only for a little while.  He had been arranging for Cowperwood's appearance on the following Thursday, Friday, and Monday in his several court proceedings.  When he was gone, however, and the night fell and Cowperwood had to trim his little, shabby oil-lamp and to drink the strong tea and eat the rough, poor bread made of bran and white flour, which was shoved to him through the small aperture in the door by the trencher trusty, who was accompanied by the overseer to see that it was done properly, he really felt very badly.  And after that the center wooden door of his cell was presently closed and locked by a trusty who slammed it rudely and said no word.  Nine o'clock would be sounded somewhere by a great bell, he understood, when his smoky oil-lamp would have to be put out promptly and he would have to undress and go to bed.  There were punishments, no doubt, for infractions of these rules—reduced rations, the strait-jacket, perhaps stripes—he scarcely knew what.  He felt disconsolate, grim, weary. "

        "text":"\"The Show Must Go On\" is a song by English rock band Queen, featured as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album, Innuendo.  The song was written primarily by guitarist Brian May, with input from the other band members.  Like the previous album The Miracle, all songs on Innuendo were credited to the band as a whole.\r\n\r\n The song appears to chronicle the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching the end of his life.  The title is derived from the phrase \"the show must go on\", and may be in reaction to the numerous press speculations about lead singer Mercury's critically declining health since the late 1980s.  Much of the lyrics and imagery of the song can also be construed to be a reflection on life and imminent death.  It is regarded as one of Queen's most emotive, powerful songs by many fans.\r\n\r\n It was released as a single in the United Kingdom on 14 October 1991 in promotion for the Greatest Hits II album, just six weeks before Mercury died.  Following Mercury's death in November 1991, the song re-entered the British charts and spent longer in the top 75 than it did on its original release, eventually reaching a peak of 16.  A live version with Elton John on vocals appeared on Queen's Greatest Hits III album.\r\n\r\n The song was chosen as the favourite funeral song in a survey conducted in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n LYRICS\r\n\r\n\r\n Empty spaces, what are we waiting for\r\n Abandoned places, I guess we know the score\r\n On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for\r\n Another hero, another mindless crime\r\n Behind the curtain in the pantomime\r\n Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore\r\n\r\n The show must go on, The show must go on\r\n Inside my heart is breaking\r\n My make-up may be flaking, but my smile... still stays on\r\n\r\n Whatever happens I'll leave it all to chance\r\n Another heartache, another failed romance\r\n On and on, does anybody know what we are living for\r\n I guess I'm learning (I'm learning)\r\n I must be warmer now\r\n I'll soon be turning (turning, turning) round the corner now\r\n Outside the dawn is breaking\r\n But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free\r\n\r\n The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah\r\n Oooh, inside my heart is breaking\r\n My make-up may be flaking, but my smile... still stays on\r\n Yeah oh, oh, oh\r\n\r\n My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies\r\n Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die\r\n I can fly, my friends\r\n\r\n The show must go on, yeah yeah\r\n The show must go on, go on, go on\r\n I'll face it with a grin\r\n I'm never giving in, on with the show\r\n\r\n I'll top the bill, I'll overkill\r\n I have to find the will to carry on\r\n On with the, on wïth the show\r\n\r\n The show must go on, go on, go on...\r\n"
