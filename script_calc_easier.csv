90,"One cold winter day a little girl and her father arrived in London. Sara Crewe was seven years old, and she had long black hair and green eyes.
She sat in the cab next to her father and looked out of the windows at the tall houses and the dark sky.
'What are you thinking about, Sara?' Mr. Crewe asked. 'You are very quiet.' He put his arm round his daughter.
'I am thinking about our house in India,' said Sara. 'And the hot sun and the blue sky. I don't think I like England very much, Father.' 'Yes, it's very different from India,' her father said.
'But you must go to school in London, and I must go back to India and work'.
'Yes, Father, I know', said Sara. 'But I want to be with you. Please come to school with me! I can help you with your lessons.' Mr. Crewe smiled, but he was not happy.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
92,"Mr. Crewe stayed in London for a week. He and Sara went to the shops, and he bought many beautiful, expensive dresses for his daughter.
He bought books, and flowers for her room, and a big doll with beautiful dresses, too.
Miss Minchin smiled, but she said to her sister Amelia: 'All that money on dresses for a child of seven! She looks like a little princess, not a schoolgirl!' When Mr. Crewe left London, he was very sad. Sara was very sad too, but she did not cry. She sat in her room and thought about her father on the ship back to India.
'Father wants me to be happy,' she said to her new doll. 'I love him very much and I want to be a good daughter, so I must be happy.' It was a very big, and very beautiful doll, but of course it could not answer.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
93,"Sara made few friends in the school. Some little rich girls are not very nice children—they think they are important because they have money and lots of expensive things. But Sara was different.
She liked beautiful dresses and dolls, but she was more interested in people, and books, and telling stories.
She was a clever child, and the other girls loved to listen to her. The stories were all about kings and queens and princesses and wonderful countries across the sea.
'How do you think of all those things?' asked her best friend, Ermengarde.
'I have all these pictures in my head,' said Sara. 'So it's easy to tell stories about them'.
Ermengarde learnt her lessons through Sara's stories, and she loved her friend very much. But not everybody was Sara's friend.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
94,"The next morning Sara's new life began. She learnt to clean floors and to make fires. She ran upstairs and downstairs, and she worked in the kitchen.
The cook was a big woman with a red, angry face.
'So,' she said, 'the little rich girl is now a servant?' She looked at Sara.
'Now, I'm making apple pies this morning. Run down to the shops and get me some apples. And be quick.' So Sara ran to the shops, and carried a big bag of apples back to the house. Then she cleaned the kitchen floor, and carried hot water up to all the bedrooms.
She worked everyday, from early in the morning to late at night.
'You speak French well,' Miss Minchin said to her coldly. 'So you can teach French to the younger children. But you're only a servant. Don't forget that.' So Sara continued to work as a servant.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
95,"The first months of Sara's new life were very hard. She was always tired and hungry, but she never cried. At night, in her little attic, she thought about her father, dead in India all those miles away.
'I must be brave,' she said. 'Father always wanted me to be brave. And I have a bed to sleep in, and something to eat every day. Lots of people don't have that.' At first Sara's only friend was Becky. Every day Becky came into Sara's bedroom. They did not talk much, but it helped Sara a lot to see Becky's friendly, smiling face. The girls in the school were sorry for Sara, but Sara was a servant now, and they could not be friendly with servants. Lavinia, of course, was pleased.
'I never liked Sara Crewe,' she told her friends. 'And I was right about the diamonds—there weren't any!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
98,"When Becky saw the room, she could not speak at first. Then she said, 'Oh, Miss! What is it? How did all these things get here?' 'I don't know,' said Sara. 'It's magic. At first I thought it was a dream, but it isn't. Look— these pies are hot. Let's eat them. Hot meat pies aren't a dream!' They sat down by the fire, and ate and drank.
'Oh, those pies were good, Miss!' Becky said, 'And the tea and the cake. I don't understand magic, but I like it!' Sara looked round the room. 'Oh Becky, look! There are some books, too. I didn't see them before.' She ran to look at them, and opened the top book. 'There's some writing here! Listen. It says, to the little girl in the attic. From a friend.' Sara closed the book and looked up. 'I have a friend, Becky,' she said slowly. 'Someone is my friend.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
99,"Every evening, when Sara went up to bed, she found new things in the attic. There were more warm blankets, for her and for Becky.
There were pictures on the walls; there were books, new shoes, and a winter coat. And best of all, there was always a fire.'
'Who does it, Miss?' 'A friend does it,' Sara said. 'A kind, wonderful friend. But he doesn't want us to know his name.' They began to look at one of the new books, and then Becky looked up.
'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'There's something at the window. What is it?' Sara got up to look. 'It's the monkey!' she said. 'The monkey from next door.' She opened the window, and the monkey jumped down into her arms. 'Oh, you poor little thing,' Sara said. 'You're so cold!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
101,"The story ended happily for everybody—but not for Miss Minchin. Sara was very rich now, and Miss Minchin wanted her to come back to the school.
She came to see Mr. Carrisford, but he said some very angry things to her, and she went away with red face.
Becky came to live in Mr. Carrisford's house, too. She was Sara's servant, and she was very happy. She had a warm room, nice dresses, beautiful dolls, and good things to eat every day. And she loved Sara very much. Another Sara's friend from school, Ermengarde, often came to visit Sara, and Sara helped her with her school lessons again. Ermengarde was not clever, but she was a true friend. They often play and read together. Ermengarde liked to listen to Sara's stories about everything in the world.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
104,"That evening, in the little attic room, Sara sat on the bed in her old black dress. She did not cry, but her face was white and she did not move or speak for hours.
Late at night the door opened quietly, and Becky looked in. Her eyes were red from crying.
'Oh, Miss,' she said. 'All the servants are talking about it. I'm so sorry!' She looked at Sara's white face, and began to cry again. Then she ran to Sara, and took her hand. At last Sara moved. Slowly, she turned her head and looked at Becky.
'Oh, Becky,' she said.
And that was all. That first night in the attic was very long. Sara did not sleep.
'Father is dead,' she whispered, again and again. 'Father is dead. I'm never going to see him again.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
105,"Winter came, with its short, dark days, and the attic rooms were very cold. There were no fires for servant girls, and often Sara and Becky could not sleep because of the cold. Sara was taller now, and her old black dress was very short. Her shoes were old, and she had no warm coat for the winter weather. She was thin, too. She did not get very much to eat, and she was always hungry. She carried big baskets of shopping through the rain and the snow. One day she found a sixpence in the snow, and she bought some hot bread with it. Then she saw a child by the door of the shop.
The child had no shoes and no coat, and her thin face was blue with cold. 'She is hungrier than I am,' thought Sara. And she gave her hot new bread to the child.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1

Would you like to go home to your people?' 'The English are my people now,' said Pocahontas.
'But perhaps one day your father—' said her friend.
'My father,' said Pocahontas, 'likes his guns better than his daughter. They are more important to him. This is my home now.' One of her new friends was a man called John Rolfe. Pocahontas liked him.

Robin's men brought them food. The food was very good, but the churchmen couldn't eat. They were too afraid.
'Not hungry?' asked Robin. 'Please eat more because we will ask you to pay something for your dinner. With a little church gold, we can help the abbot's villagers. On the abbot's land there are many poor families.' 'We are only poor churchmen,' they answered, 'and we have no money. Please don't kill us!'

I will not marry the sheriff. Listen. Tomorrow I will leave the house very early. The sheriff will come late in the morning. Tell your men to look for me. Look in every room. Be very angry.

'This is an important officer,' he thought. He jumped up to meet him, but the soldiers pushed him back.
'The officer thinks that I am crazy,' Dantes thought.
He looked at the officer. He tried to make his voice quiet and calm.
'I only want to know what is going to happen to me. Why am I here? Give me your permission to see a judge.'
'Perhaps,' said the chief officer. Then, turning to the governor, he said, 'Show me your books. What is this man's crime?'

Suddenly, one evening, at about nine o'clock, Edmond heard a sound in the wall next to his bed. He listened.
'Perhaps this is only a dream, too,' he thought.
But he heard the sound again. He heard something fall — and then silence.
Some hours later, he heard the noise again, nearer and more clearly.
Edmond listened. 'I know what that sound is,' he thought. 'A prisoner is trying to escape.'
Edmond wanted to help. He moved his bed, then he looked round the room for a sharp tool. The only things in the room were a bed, a chair, a table, and a water pot.
'I will break the water pot and use one of the sharp pieces,' he thought.
He threw the pot on the floor, and it broke into pieces. He hid two or three pointed bits in his bed.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
484,"The next morning, when Dantes moved his bed away from the wall, he heard a sound. He got down on his knees.
'Is it you?' he said. 'I am here.'
Soon after that, part of the floor of Dantes' room fell away. Stones and earth fell down into the opening. Then, at the bottom of the hole, Dantes saw the arms and head of a man. The man climbed up into the room.
Dantes reached his hands out to his new friend. He was a small man, and his hair was white. His eyes were dark, and he had a long beard. He was not strong.
'You seem very happy to see me!' he said to Dantes. 'Your happiness touches my heart.'
But Dantes knew that the man was very sad.
'You worked hard to escape,' he said, 'but you haven't reached the outside of the prison. This is just another room.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'There is one thing that I still don't understand,' he said. 'How do you do so much work?'
'I work all night.'
'At night? Can you see in the dark?'
'No, of course not. But God has given man a mind. With it, we can make what we need. I made a lamp for myself. I get the oil from my food, and it burns very well.'
Faria's words were clever and wise. Sometimes Dantes could not understand them.
'You are very wise. Will you teach me?' Dantes asked. 'I don't want you to get tired of me. A clever person doesn't want to talk to a person who knows nothing. Teach me, and then the hours will pass more quickly for you.'

'I can jump over the side of the ship,' Dantes thought, 'and swim to the island in an hour. But if I do that, how will I get the treasure away? I must wait. I waited for years to be free. I can wait for a few months to be rich.'
He looked again at the island.
'Perhaps the treasure is only a dream, a dream of Faria's. But there was Prince Spada's letter. That seemed real.'
Dantes repeated the letter to himself from the beginning to the end; he remembered every word.
Night came, and Edmond watched the island. It was beautiful with the colours of the evening, then slowly it hid itself in the darkness.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
489,"Dantes thought about his problem all the time.
'How can I reach Monte Cristo? I have no money for a small boat to get it.'
One evening, in Livorno, the captain asked Dantes to come to an important meeting.
Edmond went with the captain to see other ships' captains. They talked about a ship from Turkey which was carrying expensive cloth. They wanted to find a quiet place and meet this ship, buy the cloth and then take it to the coast of France.
'We need a quiet place where there are no customs officers,' one man said. 'A place where nobody will see us.'
'The best place is the island of Monte Cristo,' said the captain of the Young Amelia. 'Nobody lives on the island, and no customs officers ever go there.' They decided to sail to Monte Cristo the next night.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
491,"Dantes gave fine presents to all the men. He gave a new ship and some money to his best friend, Jacopo. After that, he left Livorno and went to Genoa.
In Genoa he saw a boat builder. The man had a beautiful little ship on the water.
'I built this boat for an Englishman,' the boat builder said.
It was very small.
'I can sail it myself, alone, without help,' Dantes thought. 'And it is very fast. No other ship on the water will catch it.'
Dantes offered a lot of money for the boat and asked the builder for the ship's papers.
'The Englishman will not return for some time,' the boat builder said. 'I am sure that I can build another boat for him.'
Dantes said, 'Make me a hidden place on the ship, near the top of my bed.'
The builder promised to do the work the next day.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
492,"One fine morning, a small beautiful boat sailed into Marseilles. 'I left Marseilles just here, many years ago,' he thought.
The customs officers came on board to look at the ship's papers.
A soldier stood near the steps. Even now, Dantes was afraid when he saw a soldier. Edmond now had a different name — a rich man's name. He showed the officers the ship's papers.
'This boat is owned by the Count of Monte Cristo,' the papers said.
'The count can go on shore now, if he wants to,' they said. 'There is no problem with his papers.'
Old Nicolas, a seaman from the Pharaoh, was one of the first men that he met on shore. Dantes went straight to Nicolas and asked him a number of questions. He watched the man's face carefully, but Nicolas did not know him. Dantes gave him some money and turned away.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
495,"The next morning Dantes climbed to the top of the highest rock. He looked for houses and men on the island, but there were none. It really was an empty place.
He returned to the treasure place and went into the second room. He took gold and some coins and hid them safely in his clothing. Then he covered the chest with earth, and put sand over the place.
'Nobody can see anything now,' he thought. He put a large stone over the opening and covered it with earth.

It was dark, but he saw the old, white-faced man holding on to the end of his bed in great pain.
'Ah, my dear friend,' said Faria. You know that the time has come.'
'Don't say that!' cried Dantes. I will save you again.'
He quickly lifted up the foot of the bed and took out the little bottle. There was still some red liquid in it.
'Look,' he cried. 'There is still some in here. Tell me what to do.'
'There is no hope,' Faria replied. 'But you can try to save my life. Do the same thing, but don't wait too long. If I don't get better, pour the rest into my mouth. Now put me on my bed.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

The soldiers will discover underground path. They will question the men who threw me into the sea. They will send boats of soldiers to find the escaped prisoner.

There were two men in the boat. Dantes began to swim to it, but he was too weak. He gave a cry, and one of the men in the boat shouted, 'Be strong! We are coming!'
Dantes heard their words. A wave passed over him. He came up to the top of the water, and then he went down again. The water closed over his head.

""Hello, Marilla,"" said Mrs. Lynde. ""I saw Matthew on the road. Where's he going?""
""To Bright River Station,"" answered Marilla. ""We're getting a little boy from an orphanage in Nova Scotia. He's coming on the train this afternoon.""

Matthew took the child's hand. ""There's a mistake,"" he thought. ""This is a girl, not a boy!""
""When you weren't here at the station,"" said the child, ""I thought, 'I can sleep in that big tree tonight. I know you'll come in the morning.' I know it's a long way to your house.

One day, there was a new boy in school. He was tall, with brown hair. The girls liked him.
""That's Gilbert Blythe,"" Diana said to Anne. ""His family went away for the summer. They came back on Saturday.""
Gilbert's desk was near Anne's desk. He often looked at her.
He wanted her to look at him, too. She was different from the other girls in Avonlea. But Anne wasn't interested in Gilbert.

One of the girls climbed the tree. Then another girl thought of something more exciting. ""Who can climb up to the top of Diana's house?"" she said.
""I can!"" cried Anne. She ran to the house.
""Stop, Anne! "" called Diana. ""That's very dangerous!""

One evening, Matthew went into the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne's friends were there. They laughed and talked about the concert. Matthew watched them.
""Anne looks different from the other girls. But why?"" he thought. He thought all evening, then suddenly he knew the answer. ""Anne's clothes are different,"" he thought. ""Marilla makes good dresses for Anne, but they aren't very pretty.""

That night, Anne wore her new dress to the concert. She said her two poems very well. Matthew and Marilla were at the concert, too. Later, they sat by the kitchen fire and talked.
""Anne did very well tonight,"" said Matthew.

""Oh yes, Marilla,"" said Anne, and her eyes shone. ""But isn't Queen's College very expensive?""
""Yes,"" said Marilla. ""But Matthew and I will pay for you.""

I'll take you to The Boneyard. I'm sure you'll like her very much, James.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
601,"At twelve forty-five, Bond and Leiter paid their taxi driver and walked into The Boneyard. The head waiter met them and took them to a table in the comer of the club by the small, crowded dance floor.
Bond looked round. It was not a large room, but there were about fifty tables and about two hundred people. The music stopped. The four-man band carried their musical instruments away, and the red light under the glass dance floor was turned off. Instead, pencil-thin lights in the roof came on and shone on coloured glass balls that hung around the walls - yellow, blue and red.
There were calls of 'Where's G-G?' and 'Come on, G -G !' from the crowd.
Suddenly, the MC came out onto the dance floor. A single white light shone down on him as the rest of the room went dark. There was silence.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
602,"Bond was pulled up onto his feet. He had one foot under a leg of the table and he pulled it hard. There was a crash of glass. At the same moment, Leiter kicked backwards behind his chair. His foot hit his guard's leg. Bond did the same, but missed. Then Leiter's guard threw him against the wall so hard that Leiter's nose was almost smashed. When he turned round, blood was pouring out of it.
The man giving the orders spoke to Bond's guard.
'Take him away. Mr Big's waiting.' He turned to Bond.
'Say goodbye to your friend. You probably won't see each other again.' Bond smiled at Leiter.
'See you later,' he said.
Bond's guard turned him round and pushed him against part of the wall. A door opened suddenly, and the man called Tee-Hee pushed past them.
'This way,' he said, and then the door closed behind them.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
603,"Bond was taken through several doors to a large warehouse by his guard and Tee-Hee. They walked across the warehouse floor to a metal door, and Tee-Hee rang a bell. After a moment, the door opened.
A man with a gun stepped back and they went through into a hallway.
'You can go in, Tee-Hee,' said the man with the gun.
Tee-Hee knocked on a door in front of them, opened it and then took Bond into the room. Mr Big sat behind an expensive desk, his huge head resting against the back of his chair. It was a great football of a head, twice the normal size and very nearly round.
There was nothing on the desk except an intercom with about twenty buttons and a very small riding whip. Bond's guard led him across the thick carpet to a low chair. Bond sat down and faced the man across the desk.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
604,"The woman got a chair and sat down near Bond. Her blue eyes looked into his, and they seemed to have some sort of message for him.
The silent message was clear, and a warm smile must have appeared on Bond's face. Suddenly, Mr Big picked up the riding whip from the desk and hit the girl cruelly across her shoulders.
'Sit up!' he said. She sat up slowly.
At no time did she look at Bond, but now he was sure that he had a friend.
'Are you ready, Solitaire?' asked Mr Big.
Bond looked into her eyes and repeated what he had said earlier. Did the woman know that he was not telling the whole truth? If she did, would she speak for him or against him?
For a moment there was silence. She looked at Mr Big. 'He speaks the truth,' she said coldly.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
605,"In his hotel room, Bond poured himself a whisky and then used the telephone. Leiter answered at once.
'Thank God, you're alive!' he said. 'Are you hurt?' 'Broken finger,' said Bond. 'What about you?' 'Nothing serious. Blabbermouth and I got quite friendly. I got him talking about movies and music until instructions came from Mr Big. Then he said ""Sorry, mister,"" knocked me out and took me to Bellevue Hospital. He left me outside. When I came home, I got telephone calls from the police and the FBI. Mr Big had complained that a crazy Englishman had shot three of his men early this morning.
'Mr Big wants the police to do something about it, but I talked to them and the FBI. They're not going to chase after us.
Now, tell me exactly what happened to you.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
606,"Bond told his story.
When he had finished, Leiter said, 'That Solitaire lady certainly seems to be your friend. We need to make plans.
Listen, I'll phone you again in a few minutes. First I'll get the police doctor to come and see you. While you're waiting, you'd better call your boss in London.' Ten minutes later, Bond was speaking to M. He chose his words carefully. He knew that someone might be listening to the conversation. 'It's James, Sir,' he said. 'I may need a bit of help. I went across town to see our main customer last night.
Three of his best men became sick while I was there.' 'Did you get sick?' 'Only a little, Sir,' said Bond. 'But Federated thinks I'll feel better away from town.' Bond smiled. M would know that 'Federated' was the FBI.' Bond put down the telephone and grinned.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
609,"'This is Solitaire. Listen, I've got to be quick. You must trust me. I've got to get away, and so must you. You've got to take me. I can help you - I know a lot of his secrets. But be quick. If he finds out I called you, he'll kill me. Please, you must trust me!' Bond said nothing for a moment. He was thinking fast. Then he said, 'OK, write this down. Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten twenty exactly. The Silver Phantom to ... to Washington. Pullman Car 245, Compartment H. Say that you're Mrs Bryce.
The conductor will have the ticket if I'm not already there. Go straight to the compartment and wait for me.' 'Thank you, thank you!' said Solitaire. 'Now I must go.' Bond put down the telephone. 'That's going to make things interesting,' he said to himself, smiling.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
611,"Bond stepped onto the train. A notice said: 'If you need anything, ring for your Pullman Porter, Samuel D. Baldwin.' Compartment H was more than halfway down the carriage. There was an American couple in Compartment E, but all the other rooms were empty. The door of Compartment H was locked. Bond knocked.
'Who's that?' asked a woman's voice nervously.
'It's me,' said Bond.
The door opened. Bond walked through and locked the door behind him. Solitaire wore a black suit and her eyes were wide with fear. She looked beautiful.
Bond looked round the room. Then he opened the bathroom door and looked in. It was empty. Moments later, the train began to move. He sat down on a seat with his back to the engine.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
612,"'Mr Big was certain you'd travel to Florida. I heard him warning his people down there about you. He told them to watch the airport at Tampa and the trains. Perhaps we should get off the train earlier, at one of the small stations up the coast. Did they see you get on the train?' 'I don't think so,' said Bond. He was calm again. 'Did you have any trouble getting away?' 'It was my day for a singing lesson,' she said. 'Mr Big wants me to be a singer at The Boneyard. One of his men took me to my teacher and he'll be there to collect me at midday.' She looked at her watch. 'They'll be looking for me in about an hour. I waited until the car had gone, then telephoned you. Next I got a cab and went into the city. All I've got with me is my jewelry and about five thousand dollars of my own money.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
613,"Bond rang for the train attendant and the man started to get their beds ready. He seemed worried about something and he pretended to find it difficult to move around in the small compartment. At last he said, 'Perhaps Mrs Bryce would like to go to the next room while I finish this. It's empty all the way to St Petersburg.' He unlocked the inside door to the next compartment without waiting for an answer.
Bond nodded to Solitaire, and she went through the door. Bond remembered the porter's name and said, 'Is there something you want to tell me, Baldwin?' 'Yes, Sir, Mr Bryce,' said the attendant nervously. 'You've got an enemy on this train.
You need to be careful.' He took two small pieces of wood from his pocket. 'Push these under the doors to stop them opening.'",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
615,"Bond checked the pieces of wood under the doors, then took off his tie and lay down on the bottom bed. He lay thinking about Solitaire and listening to the sound of the train. Soon it was eleven o'clock, and they were travelling between Columbia and Savannah, Georgia. It would be another six hours before they were in Jacksonville.
Mr Big had probably told his man on the train to try to kill Bond during the night, while everyone was asleep and the corridors were empty. Bond read for a while, then turned off his light and thought about Solitaire and the future. He was half asleep when he heard someone trying to unlock the door of their compartment. Bond saw a man running fast towards the end of the carriage, but he could not get his gun out quickly enough to shoot.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
619,"Bond and Solitaire got out of the taxi at a group of small white-and-yellow beach houses called The Everglades.
The two of them went through a door with the word 'Office' on it. The woman behind the desk had blue-grey hair. She smiled.
'Yes?' 'Mr Leiter?' said Bond.
'You're Mr Bryce. Mr Leiter's been waiting for you.' She took them down a path to a cottage and knocked on the door. Leiter opened it. His mouth fell open in surprise when he saw Bond.
'This is my wife,' Bond said quickly.
'Oh - yes, hello,' said Leiter.
He almost pulled the two of them into the cottage, then shut the door before Mrs Stuyvesant could speak.
A small living room looked across the beach to the sea. It had comfortable beach chairs and a large table with a glass top. There was a white telephone and some flowers on the table.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

637,"This train would leave Jacksonville at nine o'clock that morning. Bond and Solitaire walked out into the warm, dark street and found an all-night restaurant. They had breakfast and talked about their plans.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1

641,"'Tell me, what more do you know about the gold coins?' asked Bond.
'They definitely get into the USA through St Petersburg,' said Leiter. 'It comes straight from Jamaica and always stops at that factory. What's it called?' 'Ourobouros,' said Bond.
'Let's go and see the place,' said Leiter. ' And let's go and see if we can have a look at Mr Big's robber. Go and tell Solitaire to stay here until we get back, then we'll take her out to dinner.' But Solitaire did not want to be left alone.
'I want to get away from here,' she told him with fear in her eyes.
Bond kissed her.
'It's all right,' he said. 'We'll be back in an hour. Nothing can happen to you here. Then I won't leave you until you're on the plane.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
643,"Bond did not wait. He telephoned for a taxi. He got dressed and was just about to leave to go to the warehouse when the telephone rang. He picked it up.
'Mr Bryce? This is Mound Park Hospital speaking,' said a voice. 'We have a Mr Leiter here who is asking for you.' 'What happened?' asked Bond, full of fear. 'Is he all right?' 'A car accident, but it's not too serious,' said the voice. 'Can you come now?' Bond's taxi arrived and minutes later he was crossing the Treasure Island Causeway.
A nurse sat at the hospital desk. 'Yes?' she said.
'Doctor Roberts called me,' said Bond. 'I'm looking for a patient called Felix Leiter. He was brought in this morning.' 'There's no doctor called Roberts here,' said the nurse.
She looked down at a list on the desk. 'And there's no patient called Leiter.'",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
646,"Bond chose a tank which had a scorpion fish in it. He knew these did not attack, but they were poisonous when touched. He took out a pocket knife and opened the longest blade. He pulled up his shirt sleeve and put his arm into the tank.
He then pushed the knife blade quickly towards the centre of the fish's head. The knife went through it and Bond carefully removed the fish from the tank. He dropped it onto the floor. Next, he put his hand into the sand at the bottom of the tank. His fingers touched rows of coins in a flat tray. He pulled out a coin and shone his torch on it. It was gold, and it was Spanish.
Bond thought for a moment. There had to be a thousand coins in it.
'All very clever,' thought Bond.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
649,"Bond drove towards Tampa and stopped at a bar for a drink. He used the washroom to clean himself. The bandages on his left hand were dirty and his finger was very painful. He was very tired, but he got back into the car and drove towards the airport. He stopped at the first hotel that looked open and awake. It was two o'clock in the morning, and he went straight to bed. He woke up at midday and walked down the road to a cafe for a sandwich and a cup of coffee. Then he went back to his room and wrote a report for the FBI at Tampa. He said nothing in the report about the gold in the poisonous fish tanks - this would be Bond's secret. He did not want Mr Big to know he had seen the coins. Before he got on the plane, he telephoned the hospital. Leiter was no better, but no worse.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
654,"'There have always been stories about Morgan's treasure on the Isle of Surprise,' he explained. 'It's a small island in the centre of Shark Bay, where Morgan used to keep his ships. They say that when he left here for the last time in 1683, he hid his treasure somewhere in Jamaica. When he died, the secret of the treasure's hiding place on the island died with him.
'For two hundred years, treasure hunters found nothing. Then, six months ago, a New York company bought the island. People from this company said that they had come to collect shells and catch tropical fish for the Ourobouros company. One fisherman swam across there at night, planning to search for the treasure. He didn't come back and his body was never found. After that, nobody went near the island again. They were too frightened.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
657,"It was two o'clock in the morning. Bond eased his car away from the sea-wall and moved off through the town on to 4th Street, the highway to Tampa.
Bond stopped at the Gulf Winds Bar and Snacks and ordered a double Old Grandad on the rocks. While the barman poured it he went into the washroom and cleaned himself up. The bandages on his left hand were covered with dirt and the hand throbbed painfully. There was nothing Bond could do about it. His eyes were red with strain and lack of sleep. He went back to the bar. The barman looked like a college kid spending his holidays the hard way. He wanted to talk but there was no talk left in Bond. Bond sat and looked into his glass and thought about Leiter and The Robber.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1

679,When Bond arrived Strangways was there to meet him. He was good-looking and wore a black patch over one eye. The two men spoke very little until they were sitting outside Strangways's attractive white house.,james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
680,"Mr Big is on board. Oh, and a girl called Solitaire is with him. Do you know anything about her?' 'Not much,' Bond said. 'But I'd like to get her away from him. She's not one of his team.' He went outside and looked up at the stars. There was a lot to think about and a lot to do. Discovering the secret of the treasure, killing a dangerous criminal - and rescuing Solitaire.
At six the next morning, Bond and Quarrel left for Beau Desert. They were there by ten thirty. There was a path between the trees that went down to the little beach house. From inside the house, Bond looked across at the island. The top half was hidden by trees, but the cliff looked grey and dangerous in the half shadow made by the hot sun.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
685,"'I'll start at ten o'clock tonight,' said Bond. 'I'll go from the rocks at the left of the beach. Can you get us some dinner and then get the things I need out onto the beach?' Quarrel left the room, and Bond turned to Strangways.
'Now, tell me what they usually do when they're ready to sail,' he said. 'How long does it take them to get away from the island? If it's the last trip, they'll leave with extra men.' Listening carefully to Strangways, Bond suddenly felt strong again and his fear disappeared. They talked for the next three hours.
At ten o'clock, Bond was on the beach and dressed in his black frogman's suit. Quarrel and Strangways watched him go slowly into the sea and vanish under the water.
'Go safely,' said Quarrel quietly.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
686,"The heavy limpet mine was tied to Bond's chest and carried him straight to the bottom of the sea. He was carrying the harpoon gun in his left hand, but he travelled fast through the water. He was warm in the frogman's suit and breathed easily with the help of the compressed air. It took him fifteen minutes to swim through fifty yards of the dangerously sharp coral reef, which was full of all sorts of sea life. He stopped and rested for a short time at the edge of the reef. Then he swam forwards. There were shadows of big fish on the moonlit sand, some as long as himself. One shadow followed beside him, and he looked up to see a shark. Its nose was following Bond's line of air bubbles. After about a minute, it moved away.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
687,"Then there were large barracudas moving above him and looking down out of their angry eyes. They were interested in him and his bubbles and followed him silently. There were about twenty of them by the time Bond was near the island.
Suddenly, Bond could see the bottom of the boat above him. He looked at his watch. It was three minutes past eleven o'clock. He took a seven-hour fuse from his side pocket and pushed it into the limpet mine. The rest of the fuses he buried in the sand. He did not want them to be found if he was caught. After this, he swam up, carrying the mine between his hands. He fixed it as carefully as he could to the bottom of the boat and turned to swim towards some rocks. Then he saw what was happening behind him.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
689,"Something hit Bond hard on his left shoulder, and a large barracuda swam away with a piece of black rubber in its mouth. Bond felt no pain as he swam wildly towards the rocks. But blood was coming from his shoulder, and water was starting to come in between the rubber frogman's suit and his skin. He was just about to swim up to the water's surface when he saw a wide hole in the rocks in front of him. A large rock lay on its side next to it, and Bond swam behind the rock. He turned in time to see the barracuda coming towards him again. He fired the harpoon gun and hit the fish in the centre of its open mouth. The fish stopped and tried to close its mouth, then it swam away taking the gun, the line and harpoon with it.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
692,"Mr Big unlocked the door and opened it, and Bond and his guard followed him through into a long narrow room. There were metal shackles low down in the walls.
A light hung down from the roof at the far end. There was someone lying under it, under a blanket.
'Solitaire, said Mr Big softly.
Bond started to move forward, but the guard moved quickly and stopped him. Then Mr Big turned round. He had a small gun in his hand. He pointed it at Bond.
'You can let him go,' Mr Big told Bond's guard. Bond went past Mr Big. Solitaire was on her feet and moving towards him. She saw his face and began to run.
'James!' she cried. 'James!' They held each other.
'Get me some rope,' said Mr Big.
'It's all right, Solitaire,' said Bond, but he knew that everything was not all right. 'I'm here now.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
693,"Solitaire was very pale and there were black circles under her eyes. She wore a dirty white suit and looked thin. She saw the blood on his shoulder and down his arm.
'Oh, my darling, what is it?' she said, and started to cry.
'Tie them up,' said Mr Big. The black guard came towards them with rope in his hands.
For a second or two, Bond thought about attacking him.
'No, Mr Bond,' Mr Big said simply.
The guard tied Bond's arms behind his back.
Over there,' said Mr Big. He pointed at one of the shackles.
The guard knocked Bond's legs from under him, and Bond fell onto his injured shoulder. The guard pulled him across to the shackle, then put the rope through the shackle and down to Bond's legs. He tied them together. Then he walked back to Solitaire and tied her to a shackle opposite Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
694,"Mr Big looked at his watch. 'Go,' he told the guard. He closed the big door behind the man, then turned to Bond.
'Four of my men have died because of you. My people are beginning to question my power, so something must be done. What happened to the American was not enough, so you and the girl can die together.' He looked at his watch again. 'In two-and-a-half hours, at six o'clock, you will be tied together. Then you'll be pulled through the sea behind the yacht when it leaves. The coral reef will cut you into pieces, and the sharks will smell the blood. They'll finish the job for me.' Bond looked at him.
'You're a big man,' he said.. 'And one day you'll die a big and terrible death. If you kill us, that death will come very fast.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
697,"Bond felt the heavy rope pulling them under the water. He pushed hard with his legs and they came to the surface. Solitaire's head was on his shoulder and her eyes were shut.
The reef had protected them from the explosion, but now the sea was pulling them towards it. Suddenly, Bond felt the sharp coral against the back of his legs and arms.
There was something sharp under his feet, and he pushed against it. His feet were on the coral and then he felt the pain of a rock pushing into his back.
He rested for a minute. Solitaire was breathing thinly. There was blood in the water around him, but he guessed that the big fish would not come into the sharp reef.
He looked out to sea. The boat was gone, and a great cloud of smoke was blowing towards the land.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
699,"'You look wonderful,' Bond told Solitaire. They sat for a while, looking out between the trees as the sunlight started to disappear.
There was a crash of broken dishes from the kitchen at the back of the house. Then there was the sound of Quarrel shouting at someone.
'Poor Quarrel,' said Solitaire. 'He's borrowed the best cook in the village and is making us a special dinner. But it's supposed to be a surprise for us.' After they had eaten dinner, Bond told Solitaire about M's message.
'Two weeks' holiday will be wonderful. But I'm badly hurt. I'll also need someone special who can look after me and help me to get better.'
Do you know of anyone?' he asked, and grinned at her.
'Well, I haven't got any other plans for the next two weeks,' she said.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

They were full of the troubles in south-east Europe, and there was a long report about Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister. He seemed to be an honest man, but some people in Europe hated him. However, many people in Britain liked him, and one newspaper said that he was the only man who could prevent a war starting. I remember wondering if I could get a job in south-east Europe; it might be a lot less boring than life in London.
As I walked home that night, I decided to give Britain one more day. I wanted to take part in some adventures. And if nothing interesting happened, I would take the next boat back to Africa.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
722,"My flat was in a big new building in Langham Place. I was just putting the key into my door when a man appeared next to me. I recognized him as the man who lived in a flat on the top floor of the building. We had spoken once or twice on the stairs. 'Can I speak to you?' he asked. 'May I come in for a minute?'
His voice was shaking a little.
I opened the door and we went in.
'Is the door locked?' he asked, and quickly locked it himself.
'I'm very sorry,' he said to me. 'It's very rude of me. But I'm in a dangerous corner and you looked like the kind of man who would understand. If I explain, will you help me?'
'I'll listen to you,' I said. 'That's all I promise.' I was getting worried by this strange man's behaviour.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
723,"We sat at a table and my stranger took a large whisky for himself. He drank it quickly, and then put the glass down so violently that it broke.
'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I'm a little nervous tonight. You see, at this moment I'm dead.'
I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.
'How does it feel?' I asked. I was now almost sure that the man was mad.
He smiled. 'I'm not mad - yet. Listen, I've been watching you, and I guess that you're not easily frightened. I'm going to tell you my story. I need help very badly, and I want to know if you're the right man to ask.'
'Tell me your story,' I said, 'and I'll tell you if I can help you.'
It was an extraordinary story. I didn't understand all of it, and I had to ask a lot of questions...",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
725,"Constantine Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, is intelligent, he's honest, and he knows what's going on and so his enemies plan to kill him. I have discovered how. That was very dangerous for me, so I had to disappear. They can't kill Karolides in Greece because he has too many guards. But on the 15th of June he's coming to London for a big meeting, and his enemies plan to kill him here.'
'You can warn him,' I said. 'He'll stay at home. That's what his enemies want. If he doesn't come, they'll win, because he's the only man who understands the whole problem and who can stop the war happening.'
'Why don't you go to the British police?' I said.
'No good. They could bring in five hundred policemen, but they wouldn't stop the murder.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
726,"I was beginning to like this strange little man. I gave him another whisky and asked him why he thought that he was now in danger himself.
He took a large mouthful of whisky. 'I came to London by a strange route - through Paris, Hamburg, Norway, and Scotland. I changed my name in every country, and when I got to London, I thought I was safe. But yesterday I realized that they're still following me. There's a man watching this building and last night somebody put a card under my door. On it was the name of the man I fear most in the world.
'So I decided I had to die. Then they would stop looking for me. I faked everything. I've left a lot of empty whisky bottles in my room. The police will think I drank too much and then killed myself,' he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
727,"It was the strangest of stories. However, in my experience, the most extraordinary stories are often the true ones. And if the man just wanted to get into my flat and murder me, why didn't he tell a simpler story?
'Right,' I said. 'I'll trust you for tonight. I'll lock you in this room and keep the key. Just one word, Mr Scudder. I believe you're honest, but if you're not, I should warn you that I know how to use a gun.'
'Certainly,' he answered, jumping up. 'I'm afraid I don't know your name, sir, but I would like to thank you. And could I use your bathroom?'
When I next saw him, half an hour later, I didn't recognize him at first. His beard was gone, and his hair was completely different. He walked like a soldier, and he was wearing glasses. And he no longer spoke like an American.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
729,"One night Scudder was very serious.
'Listen, Hannay,' he said. 'I think I must tell you some more about this business. I would hate to get killed without leaving someone else to carry on with my plan.'
I didn't listen very carefully. I was interested in Scudder's adventures, but I wasn't very interested in politics. I remember that he said Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, was only in danger in London. He also mentioned a woman called Julia. He talked about a Black Stone and a man who lisped when he spoke. And he described another dangerous man.
The next evening I had to go out. I was meeting a man I had known in Africa for dinner. When I returned to the flat, I was surprised to see that the light in the study was out. I saw something in the corner that made my blood turn cold. There was a long knife through Scudder' heart.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
736,"I bought some sandwiches at lunch time. I also bought the morning newspaper and read a little about south-east Europe. When I had finished, I got out my friend's black book and studied it. It was almost full of writing, mostly numbers, although sometimes there was a name. For example, I found the words 'Hofgaard', 'Luneville', and 'Avocado' quite often. The word I saw the most was 'Pavia'.
I was certain that Scudder was using a code. I have always been interested in codes; I enjoy games and numbers and things like that. It seemed to be a number code, where groups of numbers replace letters. I worked on the words, because you can use a word as a key in a number code. I tried for hours, but none of the words helped. Then I fell asleep, and woke up at Dumfries.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
737,"There was a man on the platform who worried me a little; he was watching the crowd more closely than I liked. But he didn't look at me, and when I saw myself in a mirror, I understood why; with my brown face and my oId clothes I looked just like all the other hill farmers who were getting into the local train.
I travelled with a group of these farmers. The train travelled slowly through narrow valleys and then up onto an open moor. There were lakes, and in the distance I could see high mountains.
At five o'clock the carriage was empty and I was alone. I got out at the next station, a tiny place in the middle of the moor. A ten-year-old child took my ticket, and I came out of the station onto a white road across the moor.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
738,"It was a beautiful, clear spring evening. I felt like a boy on a walking holiday, instead of a man of thirty-seven very much wanted by the police. I walked along that road whistling, feeling happier every minute.
After some time I left the road and followed a path along a little stream. I was getting tired when I came to a small house. The woman who lived there was friendly and said I could sleep there. She also gave me an excellent meal.
Her husband came home from the hills later in the evening. We talked about cows and sheep and markets, and I tried to remember some of the information I heard because it might be useful. By ten o'clock I was asleep, and I slept until five o'clock in the morning.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
741,"I was now in the middle of the empty moor, and for the first time I felt really frightened, not of the police but of the people who knew that I knew my friend's secret. If they caught me, I would be a dead man.
I reached the top of a low hill and looked around. To the south, a long way away, I saw something which made me tremble...
Low in the sky a small plane was flying slowly across the moor. I was certain that it was looking for me, and I was also certain that it was not the police. I hid low in the heather and watched it for an hour or two. Finally, it disappeared to the south.
I did not like this spying from the air, and I began to think that an open moor was perhaps not the best place to hide. I could see distant forests in the east, and decided that would be better country.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
742,"It was about six o'clock in the evening when I left the moor and entered the trees. I came to a bridge by a house, and there, on the bridge, was a young man.
He was sitting smoking a pipe, dreamily watching the water, and holding a book. He jumped up as he heard my feet on the road and I saw a friendly young face.
'Good evening to you,' he said in a serious voice. 'It's a fine night to be on the road.'
The smell of cooking came from the house.
'Is that house a hotel?' I asked.
'It certainly is.'
I sat down next to him and got out my pipe. I began to think this young man might help me.
'You're young to own a hotel,' I said.
'My father died a year ago and now it's mine. It's not an exciting job for a young man like me. I didn't choose to do it. I want to write books.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
743,"You've got the right job,' I said. 'With all the travellers you meet you could be the best storyteller in the world.'
'Not today,' he said. 'Two hundred years ago, there were exciting people on the road, but today there are only cars full of fat old women, and fishermen. You can't make stories out of them. I want to sail up an African river, or live in an Indian village and write about things like that.' The hotel looked peaceful in the evening sun.
'I've travelled a bit,' I said, 'and I'd be happy to live in a peaceful place like this. And perhaps you're sitting next to adventure now. I'll tell you a true story, and you can make a book and sell it all around the world if you like.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
747,"Now I'll tell you what I want you to do,' I said. 'Go to the police station and describe the two men to them. Say you think they may have something to do with the London murder. I'm sure those two men will be back here tomorrow morning for more information about me. Tell the police to be here early.'
At about eight o'clock the next morning I watched three policemen arrive. They hid their car and came into the hotel. Twenty minutes later another car came towards the hotel, but stopped in some trees about two hundred metres away. The two men inside walked up to the hotel.
I had planned to hide in my bedroom and see what happened. But now I had a better idea. I wrote a note to thank the young man for his help, opened my window and dropped out.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

771,"A hand helped me out of the tree, and a frightened voice asked me if I was badly hurt.
The speaker was a young man who was very alarmed and very sorry. I was more pleased than angry; it was a good way for the car to disappear.
'It's my fault,' I told him. 'That's the end of my holiday, but that's better than the end of my life!' He looked at his watch. 'I'm in a hurry, but my house is very near. Let me give you some food and a bed. But what about your luggage? Is it in the river?'
'It's in my pocket,' I said. 'I'm from Australia, so I never carry much luggage.'
'From Australia,' he cried. 'You're just the man I need.'

He said the Germans didn't want a war and that if we stopped building new warships, the Germans would do the same. I thought about my friend's black book in my pocket.
But behind all the rubbish I could see that Sir Harry was a nice man. And he spoke very badly. I knew I wasn't a good speaker, but I would be better than him.
I simply told them everything I knew about Australia. I said that Britain and Australia must work together and be friends. I think I was rather a success.

A kilometre down the road behind me I could see the smoke from a small house, but otherwise there was no sign of human life. There were only the sounds of birds singing and water flowing.
It was now about seven o'clock in the morning, and as I waited, I heard the sound of an engine in the air. I realized that I was in a bad position, because I had nowhere to hide. I sat, hopelessly, as the aeroplane came nearer. It was high at first, but then it came down very low. I could see one of the two men looking at me very carefully. Then, suddenly, it went up and disappeared.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'I'm sorry I ever stopped farming!' he said. 'I was my own boss then. Now I have to do what the government orders, and I'm a prisoner here with aching eyes and a bad back. And my head's going to explode!'
He was about the same age as me and wore big black glasses. He started to work again and then stopped.
'I can't do it,' he cried. 'I'm going back to bed.'
I asked him what the problem was, although I could guess. 'It was my daughter's wedding last night, so we were dancing and drinking until four o'clock in the morning.

'Good morning,' he said. 'That's an easy job you've got there.' 'There are worse jobs and there are better jobs,' I said. I spoke in Alexander Turnbull's strong Scottish accent. The other man was looking at my boots.
'You've very fine boots.Were they made near here?'
'Oh no, they were made in London. I was given them by a man who was here on holiday last year.'
The fatter man spoke to the other in German. 'Let's move on. This man can't help us.'
They did ask one more question.
'Did you see anyone pass early this morning? Either on a bicycle or on foot?'

He was only interested in people with money, and in visiting people who lived in beautiful houses in the country. I ran up to the car and took his arm.'Hallo, Jopley.'
His mouth opened wide as he looked at me. 'Who are you?' 'My name's Hannay,' I said. 'You remember me.'
'The murderer!' he cried.
'No, but it doesn't matter. Give me your coat and hat.' He did what I asked. He was very frightened. I put his coat and hat on, and put Mr Turnbull's hat on Jopley's head. I got in the car and started it.
'Now, my friend,' I said, 'you sit quietly and be a good boy. I'm going to borrow your car for an hour or two.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

Keeping low in the heather, I moved up the hill. At the top, I stood up and showed myself. I heard men shouting, and then I pretended to disappear over the top of the hill, but in fact, I got down in the heather and crawled back down into the valley. After twenty minutes I looked back and saw the men disappearing over the top of the hill. I didn't know where I was, but I knew I must keep moving. I was twenty minutes in front of them, but they were local men and they knew these hills better than I did. Soon they were close behind me and I was running as fast as I could.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

I was in a pleasant room, with books everywhere. At a desk in the middle sat an old man with a kind face. He didn't move, but looked up and waited for me to speak.
I was so surprised by his calmness that for a minute I just stared at him.
'You're in a hurry, my friend,' he said slowly. 'The police are after you, are they? Well, we'll talk about it later. I don't like the police in my house when I'm working. Go through that door on the left and close it behind you. You will be safe in there.'
And this extraordinary man picked up his pen and started to write, and I did what he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

For half an hour they searched all the buildings. They came to the door at the bottom of my tower, and for a minute I thought they were going to come up, but the door was locked. All afternoon I lay on that roof. I was terribly thirsty, and, to make it worse, I could see and hear a small stream which came off the moor and flowed near the farm. I wanted a drink of that cool clear water more than anything in the world.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
790,"Mr Turnbull was a good friend. He took care of me for ten days, until my fever had gone and my arm was much better. He went out to work every day, locking the door, and in the evening he sat by the fire. He asked no questions, but on some days he brought me a newspaper, and I saw that the excitement over the Langham Place murder was over.
One day he gave me my money back. 'There's a lot of money there. You'd better count it and see if it's all there.'
I wanted to move as soon as possible, but it was not until the 12th of June that I felt well enough to go. I made Turnbull accept some money for my food, but it was difficult.

'You don't need to worry about the police,' he said.
'They don't want you anymore.'
'Have they arrested the murderer?'
'No. But they know it's not you.'
'How?'
'Because I heard from Scudder. I knew him a bit. He was a strange man, but he was honest. I had a letter from him on the 31st of May.'
'But he'd been dead for a week by then.'
'The letter was written and posted on the 23rd. His letters usually went to Spain and then Newcastle, so they took a week to arrive.'
'What did he say?'
'That he was in danger. He said he was living in Langham Place, and that he was with a good friend. I think he wanted to help you in case he was murdered. When I got the letter, I went to Scotland Yard and talked to the police.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'I was very busy for an hour after you went to bed,' he said. 'I've arranged for the Frenchman, Royer, to come a day early. He will be in London at five o'clock. I don't think the change of day will help very much. If our enemies already knew he was coming, they will probably find out that the plans have changed. I would love to know how the news of his visit escaped.'
While I ate, he continued to talk. I was surprised that he was telling me all these important secrets.
After breakfast, he asked me to be his driver for the day.
In London, we went first to Scotland Yard where we met an important-looking policeman.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'Is Lord Alloa at home?' I asked.
'Yes, but he's ill and has been in bed all day. Do you want to leave a message, sir?'
I put down the telephone and sat down, shaking. My part in this business was not finished. I walked straight into the room where the others were meeting.
Sir Walter looked surprised and annoyed. 'I'm afraid that this is not a good time, Mr Hannay.'
I think it is,' I answered. 'Tell me, please, who left this room a minute ago.'
'Lord Alloa,' said Sir Waiter, looking angrier.
'It was not,' I cried. 'It looked like him but it was not him.'
'Who. . .' someone asked.
'The Black Stone,' I cried, sitting down, and looking at five frightened men.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'It's impossible,' said Winstanley. 'I sat next to him for nearly half an hour.'
'That's what's so clever,' I said. 'You were too interested in other things to look at him closely. You knew that he might be well enough to come tonight and, as First Sea Lord, it was natural for him to be here. Why should you suspect that it wasn't him?'
Then the Frenchman spoke, very slowly, and in good English. 'This young man is right. He understands our enemies. People only see what they expect to see. This man came late, spoke little, and left early - but he behaved exactly as we would expect Lord Alloa to behave.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'Where is Scudder's book?' I asked Sir Waiter. 'Quick, I remember something in it.'
He gave it to me.
I found the place. 'Thirty-nine steps,' I read, and again, 'Thirty-nine steps -I counted them -high tide, 10.17 p.m.'
'Don't you see it's a clue?' I cried. 'Scudder knew where they were going to leave England. Tomorrow was the day, and it's somewhere where high tide is at 10.17.'
'Perhaps they've already gone tonight,' someone suggested. 'Not them. They have their own secret way, and why should they hurry? They don't know that we're after them.'
Whittaker looked happier. 'It's a chance,' he said. 'Let's go to the Navy Offices.'

820,"Sherlock Holmes became a detective in 1877, four years before I met him. At first he enjoyed every case, but soon he began to find the work easy. Ten years later he was famous, but he was unhappy and bored.
'The modern criminal is so painfully slow and stupid,' he often said. 'I need an interesting case, Watson, one which will make me think. Are there no clever thieves or murderers in the world these days?'
It is dangerous for a very intelligent man like Holmes to become bored. Some days he grew violent and once he shot several bullets into the walls of his room.
One day in 1888 a note arrived from Scotland Yard. When Holmes opened it, he laughed and jumped to his feet.
'Inspector Lestrade wishes to see me,' he said. 'The police need my help, Watson.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
821,"I was sitting alone at home one evening. My wife was away on a visit. Suddenly, the door opened, and Holmes came in. He then ran to the window, closed it and locked it.
'Holmes,' I cried. 'What has happened? You look terrible!'
He looked old and ill, and he was shaking with tiredness.
'What is it?' I asked. 'Are you afraid of something?'
'Of someone,' he said. 'Did you not get my letter?'
'Yes, but I didn't understand it. What is wrong?' Holmes looked at me sadly.
'You didn't understand it. Is your wife here?'
No, she is away. Do you want to sleep here? I shall make sure that you are in no danger.'
He shook his head.
'I cannot rest anywhere. If I sleep, the criminal will win! I cannot stay here. But you can help me, Watson. I must leave the country tomorrow. Will you come with me?'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
822,"Holmes ran out of the house. I followed him quickly and the next two hours passed in a wild chase all over London. We jumped into a cab, out of it again and onto a train, ran down narrow streets and in and out of a big hotel. Finally, we came to rest in the peace of a London park.
'You are a true friend, Watson,' Holmes said at last. 'You came with me without a question. Did you realize that someone was following us?'
'Holmes!'
For a moment I found it difficult to speak.
Then I asked, 'Did you see him through the window? Where was he?'
'In the empty house opposite ours. He was watching our rooms, Watson. He knows that I am looking for him. We must be very careful. He is one of the most dangerous criminals in Europe.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
825,"My sister Julia died two years ago, and that's why I'm here. We never met anybody in the country, but sometimes we visited some of my family who live near London. There Julia met a young man who asked to marry her. My stepfather agreed, but soon after this she died.' Miss Stoner put her hand over her eyes and cried for a minute.
Sherlock Holmes was listening with his eyes closed, but now he opened them and looked at Helen Stoner.
'Tell me everything about her death,' he said.
'I can remember it all very well. It was a terrible time!' she answered. 'I couldn't sleep that night. It was a very stormy night. Suddenly I heard a woman's scream. It was my sister's voice. I ran into the corridor, and just then to my sister's door. She opened it and fell to the ground.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
826,"Helen Stoner continued telling her story...
The police couldn't understand why my sister died. Her door was locked and nobody could get into her room. They didn't find any poison in her body. But I think she died because she was so afraid, but I don't know what she was afraid of. Perhaps it was the gipsies.
'That was two years ago,' Helen Stoner said. 'I have been very lonely without my sister, but a month ago a friend asked me to marry him. My stepfather has agreed, and so we're going to marry soon. But two days ago I had to move to my sister's old bedroom, because some men are mending my bedroom wall, and last night I heard that whistle! I ran out of the house immediately and came to London to ask for your help. Please help me, Mr Holmes! I don't want to die like Julia!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
827,"Holmes went out for the morning, but he came back at lunch-time. We then went by train into the country, and took a taxi to Dr Roylott's house. 'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'our dangerous friend Roylott needs the girls' money, because he only has £750 a year from his dead wife. I found that out this morning.
When we arrived, Helen Stoner showed us the three bedrooms. We saw her room first.
'Why are they mending your bedroom wall?' asked Holmes. 'There's nothing wrong with it.'
'You're right,' she said. 'I think it was a plan to move me into my sister's room.'
'Yes,' said Holmes. We went into Julia's room, and Holmes looked at the windows carefully.
'Nobody could come in from outside,' he said.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
828,"Holmes and Watson went into Dr Roylott's room. Holmes saw a large metal box near the wall.
'My stepfather keeps business papers in there,' said Helen.
'Does he keep a cat in there too?' asked Holmes. 'Look!' There was some milk on a plate on top of the box.
'Now, Miss Stoner,' he said, 'I think your life is in danger. Tonight my friend Watson and I must spend the night in your sister's room, where you are sleeping at the moment.'
Helen Stoner and I looked at him in surprise.
'Yes, we must,' he went on. 'We'll take a room in a hotel in the village. When your stepfather goes to bed, put a light in your sister's bedroom window and leave it open. Then go into your old room and we'll get into your sister's room through the window."" Helen Stoner agreed.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
829,"Holmes saw a snake and started shouting.
'The speckled band!'
The band moved and began to turn its head.
'Be careful, Watson! It's an Indian snake and its poison can kill very quickly,' Holmes cried. 'Roylott died immediately. We must put the snake back in its box.'
Very, very carefully, Holmes took the snake and threw it into the metal box.
'But how did you know about the snake, Holmes?' I asked.
'At first, Watson, I thought that it was the gipsies. But then I understood. I thought that perhaps something came through the air-vent, down the bell-rope and onto the bed. Then there was the milk and of course, snakes drink milk. And because he was a doctor, he knew that this snake's poison is difficult to find in a dead body. Perhaps the snake came through the air-vent many times before it killed Julia.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
830,"For Sherlock Holmes, there was only one woman in the world. He did not love her, because he never loved women. But after their meeting he never forgot her. Her name was Irene Adler.
One night in March I visited my old friend at his home in Baker Street. I was married by now, so I did not often see him.
'Come in, Watson,' he said. 'Sit down. I'm happy to see you, because I've got something to show you. What do you think of this? It arrived in the last post.'
It was a letter, with no date, name or address.
It said: 'Tonight someone will visit you, to talk about some very secret business. You have helped other important people, and you can, we hope, help us. Be in your room at 7.45 p.m.'
'Shall I leave, Holmes?' I asked.
'No, no, I need your help. This will be interesting,' my friend answered.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0,-3
831,"There was a knock at the door.
'Come in!' called Holmes.
A tall, strong man came into the room. He was wearing expensive clothes, and a mask over his face. 'You can call me Count von Kramm. I come from Bohemia,' he said. 'My business is most important. Before I tell you about it, do you agree to keep it a secret?'
'I do,' we said together.
'A very important person, who belongs to a royal family, has sent me to ask for your help,' he went on. 'I wear a mask because nobody must know who that person is. I must explain how important this business is. If you cannot help, there will be difficulty and trouble for one of the most important families in Europe — and perhaps a very big scandal. I am talking about the famous House of Ormstein, Kings of Bohemia.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
832,"I am the King. I am Wilhelm von Ormstein, King of Bohemia. I came to see you myself because I could not ask another person to tell my story. It must be a secret. You understand?'
'Very well. Go on,' said Holmes. He closed his eyes and listened.
'Five years ago I met a woman called Irene Adler.
'Ah,' said Holmes, I hear ...' He looked at the King. 'You left her. But before you left her, you wrote her some letters perhaps. And now you want to get these letters back.'
'That's right.'
'Did you marry her?'
'No.'
""Then if she asks you for money and shows you the letters, you can say that you didn't write them.'
'But Mr Holmes, she also has my photograph.'
'You can say that you didn't give her a photograph.' 'We were both in the photograph.'
'Oh dear. That was a mistake, Your Majesty.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
833,"The King continued his story. 'I am going to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You know, of course, that we are two of the most important royal families in Europe. Clotilde will never marry me if she learns that I have been a friend of Irene Adler. You do not know Irene Adler. She's a beautiful woman, but she can be as hard as a man. She was angry when I left her, and so she doesn't want me to marry another woman. We must find the photograph before she sends it!'
'I am sure that we will find it,' said Holmes. 'You are, of course, staying in London? I will write to you to tell you what happens. And, the money . . .?'
The King put a large heavy bag on the table. 'There is one thousand pounds here. If you need more, you must ask at once. The money is not important.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
835,"While I was near Miss Irene Adler's house, Mr. Norton himself suddenly arrived. I watched them through the windows. When he left, he jumped into a taxi. ""To the church of St Monica, as fast as you can!"" he shouted. Two minutes later Miss Adler ran out of her house, jumped into another taxi and called, ""To the church of St Monica, quickly!"" I couldn't miss this, Watson, so I jumped into a third taxi. When I arrived, I went into the church. Godfrey Norton looked round and saw me.
""Thank God!"" he shouted. ""Come here quickly!"" ""Why?"" I asked. ""Come on, man, we need you!"" And so I helped Godfrey Norton to marry Irene Adler. They needed a witness, and a servant from the street was better than nobody. So she's married him!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
836,"That evening Holmes again wore different clothes, and a large, black hat. But it was not just the clothes that were different. He changed his face, his hair - everything. He was a different man.
We walked together to Serpentine Avenue. Outside the house there were a lot of people who were smoking, laughing and talking. Holmes and I walked up and down in front of the house.
'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'I think Irene Adler doesn't want her new husband to see the photograph. But where is it? At her bank? No. Women like to keep important things themselves. I'm sure it's in her house.'
'But the King's men tried to find it!' I said.
'Yes, but they didn't know where to look!' said Holmes.
'But how will you know?' I asked.
'I won't look. She'll show me. She'll have to.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0,-3
837,"My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, You did it very well. I thought that it was a real fire, and that you were just a kind old man. But after I opened the cupboard, I began to think. I knew about the famous Sherlock Holmes. I knew your address, and I knew that the King asked you to find the photograph. So I quickly dressed as a young man and followed you home to Baker Street. I wanted to find out if you really were Sherlock Holmes. I said 'good night' to you outside your door!
My husband and I have decided to leave England. Please tell the King that I shall not show the photograph to anybody. I love my husband and he loves me. And he is a better man than the King. But here is a different photograph. And the King can keep this photograph, if he likes.
Very truly yours,Irene Norton, née Adler.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
838,"In September 1887 my wife was visiting some of her family, so I was staying with my old friend Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street. It was a windy, stormy evening, and the rain was falling heavily outside. Suddenly there was a knock at the door.
I looked at my friend in surprise. 'Who can this be?' I asked.
'If he comes on business in this weather, it's important,' said Sherlock Holmes. 'Come in!' he called.
A young man came in. He looked wet, tired and worried. 'I've come to ask for help,' he said. 'I've heard of you, Mr Holmes. People say you know everything. I don't know what to do.'
'Well, sit down,' said Holmes, 'and tell me about yourself.'
The young man sat down, put his wet feet near the fire and started telling his story.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
839,"My name is John Openshaw. My father, Joseph, had a brother, my uncle Elias, who went to live in America when he was young. He made a lot of money there. He fought against the men from the North during the Civil War. But when the South lost the war, Uncle Elias left America. So in 1869 he came back to England and went to live in a large house in the country. He was a strange, unhappy man.
'He did not want any friends,' John Openshaw went on, 'and he often drank a lot. But he liked me, and when I was twelve, I moved to Uncle Elias's house. He was very kind to me. I could go anywhere in the house. But there was one small room at the top of the house which was always locked. Nobody could go into this room. That was one of the most strange things.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
840,"One day Uncle Elias got a letter from Pondicherry in India. ""I don't know anyone in Pondicherry!"" he said, but when he opened the envelope, five little orange pips fell on to his plate. I began to laugh but stopped when I saw my uncle's white face.
""K.K.K.!"" he cried. ""Oh my God, they've found me!""
""What do you mean, uncle?"" I asked.
""Death!"" he cried, and ran upstairs.
'Uncle Elias went immediately to the secret room and took out a box which also had three Ks on it. He burnt all the papers in the box, and said to me, ""John, I know that I'm going to die soon. My brother, your father, will have all my money and my house after my death, and you will have it all when he dies. I hope you can enjoy it, but if not, give it to your worst enemy. I'm afraid that my money brings death with it.""",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
841,"Openshaw continued his story. 'I didn't understand what my uncle was talking about, and nothing happened for a few weeks, so I did not feel so worried. But my uncle was very afraid. He stayed in his room most of the time, and drank more than before. He always locked all the doors carefully. Then one night he drank very heavily and ran wildly out of the house, and in the morning we found him dead in a river. The police said he killed himself, but I knew he was afraid to die, so I didn't think that was true.'
'After my uncle's death, my father moved into the house. Of course I asked him to look carefully at the locked room, but we didn't find anything important.' 'Everything went well until a year later,' said John Openshaw. 'But one morning my father opened a letter to find five orange pips inside it...'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
842,"Openshaw kept telling his story. 'One day my poor father went to visit an old friend who lived some miles away. But he never came back. The police said that he was walking home in the dark when he fell down a hill. He was badly hurt, and he died soon after. They decided it was an accident, but I didn't agree. I thought it was murder, and I could not forget the five orange pips and the strange letters to my uncle and my father.
'But I've tried to forget, and I've lived alone in that house for nearly three years now. Then yesterday I got this.'
The young man showed us an envelope with K.K.K. on the back, and five small orange pips.
'You see?' he said. 'It comes from East London, and it says ""Put the papers in the garden"". Those are the words that were in the letter to my father.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
843,"Sherlock Holmes sat silently, and watched the fire. Then he said to me, 'John Openshaw is in real danger. Why did his Uncle Elias have to leave America? Because he had enemies. When he came back to England he was afraid. That's why he lived a lonely life and locked all his doors so carefully. Now where did those letters come from?
'The first from Pondicherry in India, the second from Dundee in Scotland and the third from East London.'
'Does that tell you anything?' asked Holmes.
'They're all sea ports. The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,' I replied. 'Somebody sent some pips from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill Uncle Elias, then it was John's father. Do you see why I'm worried now? He has sent pips to John from Londonl John's enemy is in London already!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
844,"Holmes explained evething to me, 'Killers belong to the Ku Klux Klan. That why they used the ""K.K.K."". Haven't you ever heard of it? It's a very secret group of Americans from the South. They wanted to stop equality for black people and to kill anyone who didn't agree with them. The police couldn't stop them. But in 1869 Uncle Elias, who belonged to this secret group, suddenly left America with all their papers, and so the group could not go on. Of course the group wanted to get the papers back. You remember the half-burnt paper? That was Uncle Elias's American diary. While he was working for the K.K.K., he sent the pips to frighten those three men. Two left the country, but one didn't, so the K.K.K. ""finished business with him"", or killed him. The K.K.K. always worked like that.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
845,"The next morning we read in the newspaper that John Openshaw was dead. A policeman found him in the river near Waterloo station. The police said it was an accident, but Holmes was very angry about it.
'He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!' he said to me, and he hurried out of the house.
In the evening, when he came back to Baker Street, he was tired, but pleased. 'Watson!' he said, 'I know the names of Openshaw's enemies! And now I'm going to send them a surprise! This will frighten them!' He took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope. On it he wrote 'S.H. for J.C.'
'I'm sending the pips, not from the K.K.K., but from me, Sherlock Holmes, to Captain James Calhoun.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
846,"One day, in the autumn of 1890,I decided to visit Sherlock Holmes.
But when I arrived at his apartment, I found he already had a visitor.
This visitor was an old man. He was fat, with a red face. But the most unusual thing about him was his hair. The colour of the old man's hair was bright red.
'I'm sorry, Holmes,' I said. 'I didn't know you were busy. I'll wait in the next room.'
But Holmes didn't want me to leave. He pulled me into the room and closed the door.
'This is my friend, Dr Watson,' he said to the old man. 'Dr Watson has helped me with many cases. Perhaps he can also help me with yours.'
This is Mr Jabez Wilson,' went on Holmes.
'Mr Wilson, could you please tell your story again from the beginning. I'd like Dr Watson to hear it.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
847,"Mr Wilson started his story.
'I have a small shop in Saxe-Coburg Square, in the City of London. But business hasn't been good for some time and I don't make much money any more. I used to have two assistants, but now I only pay one, and he's willing to work for half-pay.'
'That's very unusual,' said Holmes. 'What's the name of your assistant?'
'Spaulding. He is very interested in photography and takes a lot of photographs. He develops these photographs himself, in the cellar of my shop. When he isn't working, he spends all his time down there.'
'One day, eight weeks ago, Spaulding came to me with a newspaper in his hand. It was the same newspaper that I showed you, Dr Watson and told me about the Red-headed League. He also said that I could become a member and make a lot of money.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
848,"At quarter past nine that evening, I set off for Baker Street, where Holmes lived. When I arrived, I noticed two carriages standing outside Holmes' door.
Inside his apartment, Holmes was talking with two men. One of them was Peter Jones, a police detective. The other man was tall and thin, with a sad-looking face.
'Hello, Watson,' said Holmes. 'I think you already know Mr Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce Mr Merryweather. Mr Merryweather is also coming with us tonight.'
'I hope it's important,' said Mr Merryweather sadly. 'I usually play cards with friends on Saturday evenings. I have played cards every Saturday night for the last twenty-seven years.'

872,"In the summer of 1806, the young Captain Wentworth came to stay with Anne's older brother in Somersetshire. He was a very handsome, clever and strong young man. He met Anne, a pretty young nineteen-year-old girl, and the two young people soon fell in love.
They were very happy together, but only for a short time. Captain Wentworth spoke to Sir Walter one day.
'Your daughter, Anne, and I are in love, sir,' he said. 'We are very happy together. I am here to ask you, Sir Walter, for your daughter's hand. We want to marry.'
Sir Walter did not say 'yes' or 'no'. He was cold and unfriendly to Captain Wentworth and he was not interested in his daughter, Anne. He did not want to help her to marry the young man she loved. He did not want Anne to be happy.",persuasion,2,Beginner,0,-2
873,"Lady Russell wanted Anne to be happy but she too did not want Anne to marry Captain Wentworth - she thought Anne was too young. Anne was only nineteen. And Captain Wentworth had no money. She wanted Anne to wait and find a richer, more important man to marry, not a young officer in the navy. Anne listened carefully to Lady Russell. The older woman's persuasion slowly began to work. Slowly, Anne started to think her love for Captain Wentworth was wrong.
'Perhaps I am too young,' she thought. 'And perhaps I cannot help Frederick to be happy. I must think of his work in the navy - perhaps he can do better without me.'
She saw Captain Wentworth one last time that summer.
Her face was very sad. ' I am very sorry, Captain Wentworth,' she said to him, 'but I cannot marry you.'",persuasion,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

She went to Uppercross to stay with Mary and her husband, Charles, for some weeks. She was going to help Mary with her two young children. Uppercross was a beautiful old English village, about three miles from Kellynch Hall. Charles and Mary lived in a small house, Uppercross Cottage.

Charles invited him to visit them the next day at the Cottage and so it was there that Captain Wentworth and Anne met again after more than seven years. She heard his voice outside the door.

He saw her and his face went quite red: she saw in his eyes that he was at the same time amazed and sad, but perhaps happy to see her again. He spoke to her and then turned quickly away and spoke to one of his friends, but he was not cold and he was not friendly to her. After a minute or two, he turned to her again.
'You are going home, I see, Miss Elliot, but it is raining and you have no coat. Can I help you to find a carriage? You cannot walk home in the rain.'

Suddenly, the door opened and Captain Wentworth came in. Anne was nearest to him.
'How do you do?' she asked when he saw her. He stopped and they talked for a minute or two about the weather in Bath and about the Crofts. Then they had nothing more to say, but he did not leave her. Suddenly, he started to speak again - about Louisa's accident and her love for Captain Benwick. 'He wants me to understand that he was not in love with Louisa at Uppercross and in Lyme,' she thought.

When Mr Elliot heard this, he soon left Bath - he did not want to marry Elizabeth, and he knew that Anne knew his story from her friend, Mrs Smith.

'Yes. You are right. We must leave Kellynch Hall and find a smaller house to live in. Perhaps we can look for a house in Bath. A lot of interesting, rich families live in Bath!'
Anne listened. She was not happy. She did not like Bath she remembered her three unhappy years at school there, after her mother died. But they didn't ask Anne. Sir Walter was not interested in Anne.

'The food is bad again,' one of the girls said.
'Stand up!' a teacher shouted. 'Don't talk!'

'Was that Grace Poole?' I said to myself. 'Yes, it was Grace. Why was she laughing? And why is she walking in the house at night? Is she mad? I must tell Mrs Fairfax about this.'
I put on some clothes and opened the door. There was a candle on the floor outside my room. The candle was burning. There was thick smoke in the corridor. I looked around.

Then I heard a terrible laugh. The sound came from the next room.
'Grace Poole is a madwoman,' I thought. 'Why does Mr. Rochester have a mad servant?'
Mr. Rochester spoke quietly to Mr. Mason.
'I am going to bring a doctor, Richard,' he said.
Then he spoke to me. 'Stay here, Jane. Wash Mr. Mason's arm. But do not speak to him.'

'That is Mr. Rochester's bell,' the woman said. 'He wants some candles.'
I opened the door of Mr. Rochester's room. His black-and-white dog was sitting by the fire. The dog jumped up and ran towards me.
'Who is there?' Mr. Rochester said.
'Don't you know me, Edward?' I asked. 'Your dog knows me.'
I put the candles on a table. I held Mr. Rochester's hand.

'I have a plan,' he said. 'A few miles from here, there is a village. Many of the girls in the village cannot read or write. I am going to pay for a girls' school in the village. But I must find a teacher for these girls.'
'I will teach them,' I said.

Camels eat all kinds of grass and plants, even those that are dry and thorny. In fact, a hungry camel will gobble up tents, straw baskets, and even leather belts and will drink 25 gallons of water in just a few minutes! Here's an oddity: camels have a double set of eyelashes.

But it's not just the way they nap that makes insects similar to us – they also feel the strain of getting too little sleep. Bugs suffer from memory problems when they don't hit the hay, leading to decreased concentration and communication problems. As a result, they can become confused.

Rainforests have their own perfect system for ensuring their own survival; the tall trees make a canopy of branches and leaves which protect themselves, smaller plants, and the forest animals from heavy rain, intense dry heat from the sun and strong winds.
Amazingly, the trees grow in such a way that their leaves and branches, although close together, never actually touch those of another tree. Scientists think this is a deliberate tactic to prevent the spread of any tree diseases and make life more difficult for leaf-eating insects like caterpillars. To survive in the forest, animals must climb, jump, fly or glide across the gaps.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Bats sleep in caves, the hollows of trees, and empty buildings. There are many kinds of bats, in many sizes. The flying fox bat, when it stretches its wings, is wider than you are tall. But the tiny Philippine bamboo bat's wings are barely six inches from tip to tip. Most bats eat insects. The Mexican bats of Texas can eat up millions and millions of insects every year!

Instead, they run to keep away from their enemies. But the first thing ostriches do when they see an enemy is hide. To avoid being seen, ostriches generally lie flat on the ground with their necks outstretched. This makes them look like just another bush.

Yes, London is a big and beautiful city with lots to see and do. But how did it all begin ... ?
The name London comes from the Romans. The Romans came to England in AD 43.
They built houses and other buildings and made a town next to the River Thames. They called the town Londinium.",london,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1105,"Londinium got bigger and bigger. Important new buildings went up, and you can see some of the Roman city walls today, near the Museum of London.
It was a rich town with about 50,000 people living in it. But soon after AD 400, the Romans left Londinium to go back to Rome, and nobody lived in the town for many hundreds of years. The buildings began to fall down. Danish soldiers destroyed more buildings nearly five hundred years later. King Alfred was king of England then. He got the Danes to leave London and his men built the town again.
In 1066, William the Conqueror came to England from France to be king. Soon after, he began to build the Tower of London. When Henry the Eighth was king in 1509, 50,000 people lived in London again.",london,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

But the fire also destroyed most of the worst old buildings and the new houses that went up after this were better for people to live in. A new St Paul's Cathedral was built between 1675 and 1711. By 1881, more than three million people lived in London. Today, more than six million people live here.

'Where can I put some now?' he thought. 'I can't eat it, so I've got to hide all of it. Oh, yes, the flowers!'
He took the flowers out of the vase. But then the manager went past, so Mr.
Bean pretended to smell the flowers.
'Mmm, very nice!' he said.
The manager smiled and walked away.
Quickly, Mr. Bean put some meat into the vase and pushed the flowers in on top of it.
'Where next?' he thought. 'The bread!'
He took his knife and cut the bread roll. Then he quickly ate the middle of it. Now he could push some meat inside the roll. He did this, then he put the roll down.",anecdotes and real-life stories part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'I'll go to the launderette this morning,' he thought. 'I'll take the car.'

The launderette wasn't very busy that morning. Before Mr. Bean arrived, there were only two women there. The younger woman was with the launderette manager.
'I've got to wash a lot of clothes,' the young woman said to the manager. 'I'll want a big washing machine.'
'This is one of our bigger machines,' said the manager. 'Use this.'
At that minute, Mr. Bean arrived. He had the black bag on his back, and he couldn't get it through the launderette door.

'A karate suit!' thought Mr. Bean. 'Perhaps I won't say anything.'
The young man pushed his white karate suit into the washing machine.
Then he put some money into the machine and sat down on a chair.
Mr. Bean started to put his clothes into his washing machine. There were some pairs of underpants.
'Monday,' he said, and he put one pair into the machine. 'Tuesday' He put the next pair into the machine. 'Thursday. Friday. Saturday.' Three pairs went into the machine.

'Perhaps my trousers are in there!' thought Mr. Bean.
The young woman took some clothes out of the machine and put them into a bag. Then she went back to the big washing machine for her other clothes.

'Nobody's watching me,' he thought.

The waiter walked past his table again. Mr. Bean smiled at him and put his arm on the plate. After the waiter went away, he pushed down on the small plate again.
'That's better,' he thought. 'Now you can't see the meat. But there's more meat. Where can I hide it?'
'The sugar pot!' he thought. 'But it's got sugar in it.'
He thought quickly, then he put some sugar into a wine glass. Next, he put some of the meat into the sugar pot. Then he put the sugar from the wine glass on top of it.

The man with the violin walked round Mr. Bean's table and watched him. He played his violin and waited for Mr. Bean to eat the meat.
'I'll have to eat some,' thought Mr. Bean. 'He'll only go away when I eat it.'
So he put the meat into his mouth.
And the man with the violin turned away to the next table.
The meat was in Mr. Bean's mouth, but he didn't want to eat it. He wanted to put it somewhere. But where? He looked at the man with the violin. The man didn't see what Mr Bean was doing. He hid the meat under a big napkin.

1350,"Before I begin my story, I would like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York in the north of England. My father was German, but he came to live and work in England. Soon after that, he married my mother, who was English. Her family name was Robinson, so, when I was born, they called me Robinson, after her. My father wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet, comfortable life. But I didn't want that. I wanted adventure and an exciting life.
'I want to be a sailor and go to sea,' I told my mother and father.
They were very unhappy about this. About a year later, I saw a friend in town. His father had a ship and so, on September 1st, 1651, I went to Hull, and the next day we sailed for London.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1351,"For two long years I was a slave. I worked in the house and the garden, and every day I planned to escape, but it was impossible. I thought about it day and night. My master liked to go fishing in a little boat, and he always took me with him. A man, called Moely, and a young boy also went with us.
One day my master said to us, 'Some of my friends want to go fishing tomorrow. Get the boat ready.'
So we put a lot of food and drink on the boat, and the next morning, we waited for my master and his friends. But when my master arrived, he was alone.
'My friends don't want to go fishing today,' he said to me. 'But you'll go and catch some fish for our supper tonight.'
'Yes, master,' I answered quietly, but inside I was excited. 'Perhaps now I can escape,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1352,"That day I was lucky, and the sea carried me to the shore. I could not see the land, only mountains of water all around me.
Then, suddenly, I felt the ground under my feet. Another mountain of water came, pushed me up the beach, and I fell on the wet sand. At first I was very thankful to be alive. Slowly, I got to my feet and went higher up the shore. From there, I looked out to sea. I could see our ship, but it was wrecked and there was nobody near it.
There was nobody in the water. All my friends were dead. I was alive, but in a strange wild country, with no food, no water, and no gun. It was dark now and I was tired. I was afraid to sleep on the shore. Perhaps there were wild animals there. So I went up into a tree and I stayed there all night.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1353,"I looked around the ship, and after a few minutes, I found some long pieces of wood. I wanted to bring them to the shore. So I tied them together with rope. Then I got the things that I wanted from the ship. There was a big box of food - rice, and salted meat, and hard ship's bread. I also took many strong knives and other tools - the ship's sails and ropes, paper, pens, books, and seven guns. Now I needed a little sail from the ship, and then I was ready. Slowly and carefully, I went back to the shore. It was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea, but in the end I got everything on to the shore.
Now I needed somewhere to keep my things. There were some hills around me, so I decided to build myself a little house on one of them.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1354,"The next day I thought about the possible dangers on the island. Were there wild animals, and perhaps wild people too, on my island? I didn't know, but I was very afraid. So I decided to build a very strong fence. I cut down young trees and put them in the ground, in a half-circle around the front of my tent. I used many of the ship's ropes too, and in the end my fence was as strong as stone wall. Nobody could get over it, through it, or round it.
Making tents and building fences is hard work. I needed many tools for it. So I decided to go back to the ship again, and get some more things.
I went back twelve times, but soon after my twelfth visit there was another terrible storm. The next morning, when I looked out to sea, there was no ship.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1356,"I was on the island for ten months before I visited other parts of it. During those months I worked hard on my cave and my house and my fence. Now I was ready to find out more about the rest of the island.
First, I walked along the side of a little river. There, I found open ground without trees. Later, I came to more trees with many different fruits. That night I went to sleep in a tree for the second time, and the next day I went on with my journey. Soon I came to an opening in the hills. In front of me, everything was green, and there were flowers everywhere.
There were also a lot of different birds and animals. I saw that my house was on the worst side of the island. But I didn't want to move from there. I stayed away for three days, and then I came home.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1357,"And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. The roof of my cave fell in, and nearly killed me! I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.
I had a lot of food now. I cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun. So I always had meat during the rainy months when I could not go out with a gun.
I learnt to make pots to keep my food in. I wanted very much to make a harder, stronger pot - a pot that would not break in a fire. I tried many times, but I could not do it.
Then one day I was lucky. I made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire.
They changed colour, but did not break.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1358,"By then, I also had my own bread. That was luck, too. One day I found a little bag. We used it on the ship, to keep the chickens' food in. There was still some of the food in the bag, and I dropped some of it onto the ground.
A month later, I saw something bright green. And after six months I had a very small field of corn. I was very happy and excited. Perhaps now I could make my own bread!
It was easy to say, but not so easy to do. It is a lot of work to make bread from corn. Many people eat and enjoy bread, but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help? I had to learn and to make many new things, and it was a year before I cooked and ate my first bread.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2
1359,"During all this time I never stopped thinking about escape. When I travelled across to the other side of the island, I could see the other islands, and I said to myself, 'Perhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day.'
So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe.
Next, I had to get it down to the sea. How stupid I was! Why didn't I think before I began work? Of course, the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it! I pulled and pushed and tried everything, but it didn't move. I was very unhappy for a long time after that. That happened in my fourth year on the island.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1360,"In my sixth year I made myself a smaller canoe, but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey, and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now, not my prison, and I was just happy to be alive. A year or two later, I made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island. I also built myself a second house there, and so I had two homes.
My life was still busy from morning to night. There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. I kept food and tools at both my houses, and also wild goats. There were many goats on the island, and I made fields with high fences to keep them in. They learnt to take food from me, and soon I had goat's milk to drink every day.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1361,"Then, one year, something strange and terrible happened.
I often walked along the shore, and one day I saw something in the sand. I went over to look at it more carefully, and stopped in a sudden surprise.
It was a footprint - the footprint of a man! Afraid, I looked around me. I listened. I waited. Nothing. I was more and more afraid. Perhaps this man was one of those wild people who killed and ate the men! I looked everywhere, but there was nobody, and no other footprint. I turned and hurried home.
'There's someone on my island,' I said to myself.
That night I couldn't sleep. The next day I got all my guns ready and I put more wood and young trees around my house. Nobody could see me now. But, after fifteen years on the island, I was afraid, and I did not leave my cave for three days.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1362,"In the end, I had to go out to milk my goats. But for two years I was afraid. I stayed near my home and I never used my guns because I didn't want to make a noise. I could not forget the footprint, but I saw and heard nothing more, and slowly I began to feel happier.
One day, a year later, I was over on the west side of the island. From there I could see the other islands, and I could also see a boat, far out to sea. 'If you have a boat,' I thought, 'it's easy to sail across to this island. Perhaps that explains the footprint - it was a visitor from one of the other islands.'
I began to move more freely around the island again, and built myself a third house. It was a very secret place in a cave.
'No wild man will ever find that,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1363,"For two years I never went anywhere without my gun. I felt lonely and afraid, and had many sleepless nights.
One night there was a very bad storm, and I thought I heard the sound of guns out at sea.
The next morning I looked out, and saw a ship. It was lying on its side not far from the shore. Quickly, I put my little boat in the water and sailed out to it.
There were two dead men on the ship, but no one alive. The bodies of the other sailors were lost in the sea.
In the morning I woke up and made a plan. 'I'll try to catch one of the prisoners of the wild men,' I said to myself.
He'll be happy to be alive and perhaps he'll help me to escape.'
I watched day and night, but for a year and a half there were no boats.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1365,"I called to him and tried to show him that I was friendly. Slowly, he moved nearer to me, but just then the first wild man began to get up from the ground. Then the prisoner spoke and I understood that he wanted my sword. How happy I was to hear words again! I gave him my sword, and at once he cut off the head of his enemy. Hurriedly, we hid the dead bodies under some leaves, and then left quickly. I took my prisoner to my secret cave on the other side of the island and gave him food and drink. After that, he went to sleep.
He was a fine young man, about twenty-five years old, well-built, with a kind face and a nice smile. He had brown skin, black hair, bright eyes and strong white teeth. I decided to give him the name of 'Man Friday', because I first saw him on a Friday.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1366,"When we got to my house, 1 gave Man Friday some trousers, and I made him a coat and a hat. He liked his new clothes very much. Then I made him a little tent to sleep in, but for a few weeks I always took my gun to bed with me. Perhaps Friday was still a wild man and would try to kill me in the night. At first, Friday was very afraid of my gun. Sometimes he talked to it, and asked it not to kill him.
Friday was a quick learner and his English got better day by day. He helped me with the goats and with the work in the cornfields, and soon we were good friends. I enjoyed teaching him and, most of all, having a friend to talk to. This was the happiest of all my years on the island. Friday and I lived together happily for three years.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1367,"I told Friday the story of my adventures and about life in England, and he told me about his country and his people. One day we were at the top of the highest hill on the island, and we were looking out to sea. It was a very clear day and we could see a long way. Suddenly, Friday began to jump up and down, very excited.
'What's the matter?' I said.
'Look, Master, look!' Friday cried. 'I can see my country. Look over there!'
I looked, and there to the north-west, between the sea and the sky, was a long thin piece of land. I learnt later that it was the island of Trinidad, and that my island was in the mouth of the River Orinoco on the north coast of South America.
I began to think again about escape. Perhaps Friday wanted to go home too. Perhaps together we could get to his country.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1368,"I took Friday to the other side of the island and showed him my big canoe. It still lay under the trees. It was very old now, and there were holes in the wood.
'Could a boat like this sail to your country, Friday?' I asked him.
'Oh yes,' he answered. 'A boat like this can carry a lot of food and drink.'
'Then we'll make another canoe like it, and you can go home in it,' I said.
But Friday looked very unhappy.
'Why are you angry with me?' he asked. 'What have I done? Why do you want to send me home?'
'But I thought you wanted to go home,' I said.
'Yes. But you must come with me.'
Then I saw that Friday was a true friend, and so I agreed to go with him. We began work on the canoe at once. We worked hard and in a month the boat was finished.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2
1370,"When I came back to England, I felt like a stranger in the country. Many things were different, and not many people remembered me. I went home to Yark, but my father and mother were dead, and also my two brothers. I did find the two sons of one of my brothers. They were happy to learn that I was alive, and I was pleased to find some family.
After some months I decided to go down to Lisbon in Portugal. I had friends there who could help me to sell my land in Brazil, and I needed the money. Friday came with me. He was always a good and true friend to me.
In Lisbon I found the Portuguese captain, who took me in his ship to Brazil, all those years ago. It was good to see him again, and he helped me with my business. Soon I was ready to go home again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1371,"It was a long hard fight, but by now it was dark and this helped us very much. We ran here and there in the trees, calling and shouting. The seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting.
In the end the first officer shouted to them: 'Put down your guns and stop fighting! The captain has fifty island people to help him. We can kill you all!'
So the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns. Three of the men agreed to come back to the captain, and we put the others in my cave. Friday and I stayed to watch the prisoners, while the captain and his men went back to fight for the ship. All night we listened to the sound of guns and shouting, but in the morning, when the sun came up, the captain was master of his ship again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1372,"Friday and I went down to the shore to meet the captain.
'My dear friend,' he cried. 'There's your ship! I'll take you to the end of the world in it!'
I put my arms round him, and we laughed and cried together. How happy I was to leave the island!
My good friend Friday came with me, of course, but we left the mutineers on the island. We decided not to kill them; they could begin a new life on the island. I showed them my three houses, my cornfields and my goats, and all my tools. Their life would be easy because of all my hard work for so many years.
And so, on the nineteenth of December 1686 - after twenty-seven years, two months and nineteen days - I said goodbye to my island and sailed home to England.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1373,"Our journey back to England was long and hard. We had to cross the mountains between Spain and France in winter, and the snow was deep. Poor Friday was very afraid of the snow.
In his country it was always hot, and he did not like cold weather.
Back in England I found a house and began to live a quiet life. My two nephews came to live with me. The younger one wanted to be a sailor, and so I found him a place on a ship. After a while I married, and had three children, two sons and a daughter. Then my wife died, and my nephew, who was now the captain of a ship, came home to see me. He knew that I did not really like a quiet life.
'I have a fine ship, uncle,' he said. 'I'm going out to the East Indies. Why don't you come with me?'
So, in 1694, I went to sea, and had many more adventures.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1374,"There were eleven men in the boat, but three of them were prisoners. Their arms were tied with rope, but their legs were free and they could walk. The other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach, laughing and shouting and hitting them. Then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink. Others walked away to look at the island, and two men stayed to watch the boat. The three prisoners walked slowly along the beach and sat down under a tree, not far from us. They looked very unhappy.
Very quietly, I came up behind them through the trees, and called out to them in English.
'Don't be afraid,' I said. 'I'm an Englishman. Perhaps I can help you.'
The three men turned and looked at me. They did not answer at once; they were too surprised.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1375,"Perhaps the men thought I was a wild man myself, in my strange homemade clothes, and with my long hair and beard. Then the oldest man spoke.
'I am the captain of that ship,' he said, 'and these two men are my first and second officers. Last night there was a mutiny, and the seamen took the ship from me. Now they're going to leave the three of us here, to die on this island.'
'Do these mutineers have guns?'
'Only two,' he answered, 'and they've left those on the boat.'
'All right,' I said. 'We'll fight them, but if we get your ship back for you, you must take me back to England.'
The captain agreed immediately and thanked me very warmly for my help. Friday ran back to my house to get all the guns, and the captain and I made a plan.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1379,"Then one year something happened which I can never forget. I was again on the west side of the island and was walking along the shore. Suddenly, I saw something which made me feel ill. There were different parts of men's bodies everywhere. For a minute, I couldn't think, and then I understood. Sometimes there were fights between the wild men on the other islands.
Slowly, I went home, but I was very angry. How could men do this? For many months I watched carefully for the smoke from fires, but I didn't see anything. Somehow the wild men came and went, and I never saw them. I was angry and afraid. I wanted to shoot them all, but there were many of them and only one of me.

1385,"I got the things that I wanted from the ship. There was a big box of food - rice, and salted meat, and hard ship's bread. I also took many strong knives and other tools - the ship's sails and ropes, paper, pens, books, and seven guns.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1386,"It was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea, but in the end I got everything on to the shore. Now I needed somewhere to keep my things.

1387,"The next day I thought about the possible dangers on the island. Were there wild animals, and perhaps wild people too, on my island? I didn't know, but I was very afraid. So I decided to build a very strong fence.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1388,"Making tents and building fences is hard work. I needed many tools for it. So I decided to go back to the ship again, and get some more things. I went back twelve times, but soon after my twelfth visit there was another terrible storm.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1389,"Every day I worked. First of all, I wanted to make my cave bigger. I carried out stone from the cave, and after many days' hard work I had a large cave in the side of the hill. Then I needed a table and a chair, and that was my next job.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1390,I was on the island for ten months before I visited other parts of it. During those months I worked hard on my cave and my house and my fence. Now I was ready to find out more about the rest of the island.,robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

1392,And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.,robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1393,"I learnt to make pots to keep my food in. I wanted very much to make a harder, stronger pot - a pot that would not break in a fire. I tried many times, but I could not do it. Then one day I was lucky. I made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1394,"By then, I also had my own bread. That was luck, too. One day I found a little bag. We used it on the ship, to keep the chickens' food in. There was still some of the food in the bag, and I dropped some of it onto the ground.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1395,"And after six months I had a very small field of corn. Perhaps now I could make my own bread! It was easy to say, but not so easy to do. Many people eat and enjoy bread, but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help?",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2

1397,"So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe. Next, I had to get it down to the sea. Why didn't I think before I began work?",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2

1400,"Nobody seemed to care about Mary. She was born in India, where her father was a British official. He was busy with his work, and her mother, who was very beautiful, spent all her time going to parties. So an Indian woman, Kamala, was paid to take care of the little girl. Mary was not a pretty child. She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair. She was always giving orders to Kamala, who had to obey. Mary never thought of other people, but only of herself. In fact, she was a very selfish, disagreeable, bad tempered little girl. One very hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she woke up and saw that instead of Kamala there was a different Indian servant by her bed. 'What are you doing here?' she asked crossly. She was furious.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1402,"After the long sea journey, Mary was met in London by Mr Craven's housekeeper, Mrs Medlock. Together they travelled north by train. Mrs Medlock was a large woman, with a very red face and bright black eyes. Mary did not like her, but that was not surprising, because she did not usually like people. Mrs Medlock did not like Mary either.
'What a disagreeable child!' thought the housekeeper. 'But perhaps I should talk to her.'
'I can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like,' she said aloud. 'He lives in a big old house, a long way from anywhere. There are nearly a hundred rooms, but most of them are shut and locked. There's a big park round the house, and all kinds of gardens. Well, what do you think of that?'
'Nothing,' replied Mary. 'It doesn't matter to me.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1403,"Mary stared out of the train window at the grey sky and the rain. She was not looking forward to life at her uncle's house. The train journey lasted all day, and it was dark when they arrived at the station. Then there was a long drive to get to the house. It was a cold, windy night, and it was raining heavily. After a while, Mary began to hear a strange, wild noise. She looked out of the window, but could see nothing except the darkness.
'What's that noise?' she asked Mrs Medlock. 'It's not the sea, is it?'
'No, that's the moor. It's the sound the wind makes, blowing across the moor.'
'What is a moor?'
'It's just miles and miles of wild land, with no trees or houses. Your uncle's house is right on the edge of the moor.'
Mary listened to the strange sound. 'I don't like it,' she thought.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1404,"Mrs Medlock and Mary arrived at a very large old house. It looked dark and unfriendly from the outside. Inside, Mary looked around the big shadowy hall, and felt very small and lost. They went straight upstairs. Mary was shown to a room where there was a warm fire and food on the table.
'This is your room,' said Mrs Medlock. 'Go to bed when you've had some supper. And remember, you must stay in your room! Mr Craven doesn't want you to wander all over the house!'
When Mary woke up the next morning, she saw a young servant girl cleaning the fireplace. The room seemed dark and rather strange, with pictures of dogs and horses and ladies on the walls. It was not a child's room at all. From the window she could not see any trees or houses, only wild land, which looked like a kind of purple sea.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1405,"Martha woke up and stared a young servant.
'You'll have to learn to play by yourself. Dickon plays by himself on the moors for hours, with the wild birds, and the sheep, and the other animals.' She looked away for a moment. 'Perhaps I shouldn't tell you this, but - but one of the walled gardens is locked up. Nobody's been in it for ten years. It was Mrs Craven's garden, and when she died so suddenly, Mr Craven locked it and buried the key - Oh, I must go, I can hear Mrs Medlock's bell ringing for me.'
Mary went downstairs and wandered through the great empty gardens.
'How ugly it all looks in winter!' she thought. 'But what a mystery the locked garden is! Why did my uncle bury the key? If he loved his wife, why did he hate her garden? Perhaps I'll never know.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1406,"In the next few days Mary spent almost all her time in the gardens. The fresh air from the moor made her hungry, and she was becoming stronger and healthier. One day she noticed the robin again. He was on top of a wall, singing to her.
'Good morning! Isn't this fun! Come this way!' he seemed to say, as he hopped along the wall Mary began to laugh as she danced along beside him.
'I know the secret garden's on the other side of this wall!' she thought excitedly. 'And the robin lives there! But where's the door?'
That evening she asked Martha to stay and talk to her beside the fire after supper. They could hear the wind blowing round the old house, but the room was warm and comfortable. Mary only had one idea in her head.
'Tell me about the secret garden,' she said.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1407,"The next day it was very rainy, so Mary did not go out. Instead she decided to wander round the house, looking into some of the hundred rooms that Mrs Medlock had told her about. She spent all morning going in and out of dark, silent rooms, which were full of heavy furniture and old pictures. She saw no servants at all, and was on her way back to her room for lunch, when she heard a cry.
'It's a bit like the cry that I heard last night!' she thought. Just then the housekeeper, Mrs Medlock, appeared, with her keys in her hand.
'You didn't hear anything! Go back to your room now. And if you don't stay there, I'll lock you in!'
Mary hated Mrs Medlock for this.
There was someone crying, I know there was!' she said to herself. 'But I'll discover who it is soon!'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1409,"Mary was walking beside the long wall of the secret garden, when the most wonderful thing happened. She suddenly realized the robin was following her. She felt very pleased and excited by this, and cried out, 'You like me, don't you? And I like you too!'
As he hopped along beside her, she hopped and sang too, to show him that she was his friend. Just then he stopped at a place where a dog had dug a hole in the ground. As Mary looked at the hole, she noticed something almost buried there. She put her hand in and pulled it out. It was an old key.
'Perhaps it's been buried for ten years,' she whispered to herself. 'Perhaps it's the key to the secret garden!'
She looked at it for a long time. How lovely it would be to find the garden, and see what had happened to it in the last ten years!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1410,"Mary skipped all the way to the secret garden wall. And there was the robin! He had followed her!
'You showed me where the key was yesterday,' she laughed. 'I've got it in my pocket. So you ought to show me the door today!'
The robin hopped on to an old climbing plant on the wall, and sang his most beautiful song. Suddenly the wind made the plant move, and Mary saw something under the dark green leaves. The thick, heavy plant was covering a door. Mary's heart was beating fast and her hands were shaking as she pushed the leaves away and found the keyhole. She took the key out of her pocket, and it fitted the hole. Using both hands, she managed to unlock the door. She pushed the door, which opened, slowly, for the first time in ten years. At last she was inside the secret garden!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1411,"Mary almost forgot about lunch, and when she arrived back in her room, she was very hungry and ate twice as much as usual.
'Martha,' she said as she was eating, 'I've been thinking. This is a big, lonely house, and there isn't much for me to do. Do you think, if I buy a little spade, I can make my own garden?'
'That's just what Mother said,' replied Martha. 'You'd enjoy digging and watching plants growing. Dickon can get you a spade, and some seeds to plant if you like.'
'Oh, thank you, Martha! I've got some money that Mrs Medlock gave me. Will you write and ask Dickon to buy a spade and some seeds for me?'
'I will. And he'll bring them to you himself.'
'Oh! Then I'll see him.' Mary looked very excited.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1412,"In the middle of the night Mary woke up. Suddenly she heard crying again. This time she decided to discover who it was. She left her room, and in the darkness followed the crying sound, round corners and through doors, up and down stairs, to the other side of the big house. At last she found the right room. She pushed the door open and went in. It was a big room with beautiful old furniture and pictures. In the large bed was a boy, who looked tired and cross, with a thin, white, tearful face. He stared at Mary.
'Who are you?' he whispered. 'Are you a dream?'
'No, I'm not. I'm Mary Lennox. Mr Craven's my uncle.'
'He's my father,' said the boy. 'I'm Colin Craven.'
'No one ever told me he had a son!' said Mary, very surprised.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1416,"Colin covered his eyes with his hands until he was inside the four high walls, and the door was shut again. Then he looked round at the roses climbing the old red walls, the pink and white flowers on the fruit trees, and the birds and the butterflies everywhere. The sun warmed his face, and he suddenly knew he felt different.
'Mary! Dickon!' he cried. 'I'm going to get better! I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!'
As Dickon pushed the wheelchair all round the garden, he told Colin the names of all the plants. The sun shone, the birds sang, and in every corner of the garden there was something interesting to look at. The three children talked and laughed, and by the end of the afternoon all three were speaking Yorkshire together.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1417,"That morning Mr Craven received a letter from Susan Sowerby. In it she asked him to come home, but she did not give a reason. Mr Craven thought of his dream, and decided to return to England immediately. On the long journey back to Yorkshire, he was thinking about Colin.
'I wonder how he is! I wanted to forget him, because he makes me think of his mother. He lived, and she died! But perhaps I've been wrong.'
When he arrived home, he found the housekeeper very confused about Colin's health.
'He's very strange, sir,' said Mrs Medlock. 'He used to scream even at the idea of fresh air, but now he spends all his time outside in his wheelchair, with Miss Mary and Dickon Sowerby. He's in the garden at the moment.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'How can I have done that?' she thought. ' I must be growing small again.'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
That was a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but the little door was shut again, and the golden key was lying on the glass table.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves — that is, if I can find them.'

'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.

The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see — how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and she decided to bite it.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

1570,"The Pareto principle (also known as the ""80-20 rule"") says that for many things, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. The original observation was in connection with income and wealth. Vilfred Pareto, a French-Italian philosopher (1848-1923) noticed that 80% of Italy's wealth was owned by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found that a similar distribution applied. These days, the Pareto principle can be applied to a number of different scenarios. In business, directors often use the Pareto principle to analyse the company. For example, they may find that 80% of the sales come from 20% of their clients; or that 20% of the workforce creates 80% of the company's wealth.",different stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Louis Pasteur then turned to practical ways of killing bacteria in liquids such as milk. His process of pasteurisation successfully killed bacteria in milk without destroying milk protein. This was a radical discovery and made drinking milk safe. The process of pasteurisation was named after him and it saved many lives.

If someone says they will meet me at 2 pm, they arrive at 2 pm not 2:05 (or 1:55, for that matter). I like this. For a while.
Then it annoys me. The extreme punctuality strikes me as a kind of stinginess.
That is unfair though, and finally, invariably, I come to appreciate Swiss punctuality for what it is: a deep expression of respect for other people. A punctual person is a considerate one.

Unlike in a musical, opera performers usually don't speak at all. The music an orchestra plays for an opera is as important to the overall effect as the singing. Traditional opera tells a big story in a grand way. The story is usually serious, though there are comic operas too. Many operas tell tragic tales of lovers who are kept apart. Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde is one of these. Some operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute, tell a story of mystery and enchantment.

This 80 to 40 is the magic range and it can increase the life of your battery by as much as four times. When you consider that the price of a new battery can cost over 200 dollars, you can save a lot of money. What makes a big difference in battery life? It's stress on the battery.

To help you better judge when to go out and take photographs, a team of developers have created Golden Hour, a new iOS app that ""helps you to find the best time, place, and weather for your outdoor pictures."" Rather than guessing what time of day would be best to snap a few portraits or landscape shots, Golden Hour relies on two proprietary measurements to help guide you in the right direction.

Currently, the taxi-booking app relies on Google's mapping technology to display local maps and mark pick-up locations. But a senior Uber executive says that more relevant information can be drawn if it produces its own roadmaps.
""Existing maps are a good starting point, but some information isn't that relevant to Uber, like ocean topography,"" said Brian McClendon, who up until 2014 was vice-president of Google Maps.

He was in United's Youth Team and did all the usual trainee jobs - he helped in the ground, he cleaned boots. On 4 April, 1953 Matt Busby said, 'Get your boots on. You're playing against Cardiff City this afternoon.' Edwards was the youngest footballer in a Division One team. In 1955, Edwards became the youngest English international player when he played for England. This was a record until Liverpool's Michael Owen played for England in 1998.

He did not like being away from home and he returned to Northern Ireland after a few weeks. His father sent him back to Manchester and he first played in the team in 1963. One success followed another. In 1966 he scored two goals against Benfica, when United won 5-1 . The Portuguese called him 'El Beatle', because he had long hair like the Beatles.

Manchester United's main training ground is The Cliff. The players train there five or six days a week. They usually begin at half-past ten in the morning and train for two hours, then for another hour after lunch. The first week of training in July is mostly running and ball work. During a ninety-minute game, a footballer sometimes runs about ten kilometres, but footballers do not run for every minute of the game and they do not always run fast. The training run practises this. The players run 100 metres quite slowly, but then they run faster, and then very fast.

At the end of July, they play five or six friendly games against other clubs. They do not train so much during the season - usually for two hours, not three. Before a game, the manager and trainer have watched the other club. They discuss special tactics for the game and practise them.

They were looking for boys who could play football. Managers then were usually not very interested in training. But Busby was an unusual man. He put on his sports clothes and trained with his footballers. Sadly, Busby lost some of his best young players in the Munich air crash. He began again,looking for new young players.

With three Cups in three weeks, he is the most successful manager in football. He is also the best Manchester United manager since Sir Matt Busby. The fans think this is the greatest football team.

Ferguson keeps his young players 'hungry' to play. Sometimes they train with the first team for two or three days. Then for two weeks they do their training with the Youth Team again.

When he scored a goal, he always put his right arm up. Fans saw Law's right arm in the air thirty times in 1963-1964. He was named European Footballer of the Year that year. When Tommy Docherty became United's manager, Law went to Manchester City. In the 1974 City game against United, he scored with the back of his foot.

Traditionally, polo has been the rich person's sport. The most famous club in Britain is Guards. This traditional club is famous for its links with the Royal Family, its glamorous parties, and its professional tournaments. Every member at Guards is expected to have a number of polo ponies, each worth tens of thousands of pounds.
However, one of the newer clubs, Fifield, rents out their ponies at £50-£70 a go. This brings the cost down to just a few hundred pounds for a match. OK, so the club's summer membership fee is still fairly high at £1,250, but the overall cost is not beyond a new class of riders.",sport,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Dr Rachel Edgar, study author, said: ""The results indicate that shift workers, who work some nights and rest some nights and so have a disrupted body clock, will be more susceptible to viral diseases.",health,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

In one case, a 22-year-old woman was experiencing vision loss in her left eye—but only at night. After months of tests, doctors had no idea what was causing the transient blindness. The problem is that when you lie in bed looking at your phone, you're often only looking at it with one eye while the other is blocked by the pillow, explain the researchers. This causes ""photopigment bleaching"" in the eye that adapts to the bright screen light, while the other eye is busy adapting to the dark of your pillow. If you absolutely must stay logged on for those last moments of consciousness each day, make sure you're using both eyes.",health,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

But it turns out rhubarb's been hiding a powerful secret - scientists have discovered that parietin, an orange-coloured compound found in plants like rhubarb and lichen, quickly breaks down leukaemia cells, as well as tumours found in the lungs, head and neck. In the tests, run by scientists at Atlanta's Emory University, it took just 48 hours for parietin to eliminate half of the leukaemia cells in a culture, while leaving the healthy blood cells untouched.

The weather is miserable, days are shorter and going back to work after a break is always going to be tough.' Unfortunately there is no clear-cut test for depression, but the two main signs to watch out for according to Murphy are withdrawing from life and hopelessness. 'Firstly, not being interested in things that you're normally interested in, for example not taking part in social activities and hobbies or even not being able to go to work - withdrawing from your life a little bit.' 'The second thing is hopelessness. If you're feeling very low and hopeless and saying things like, 'I can't see the point anymore,' then that's another sign to watch out for.'",health,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

'You're trying to establish structure and order in your life to handle the chaos of bringing up children. Unfortunately, people confuse being a good parent with having a rigid routine, but ironically, the opposite is true.' Anxiety and parenting seem to go hand-in-hand, and my own need for control is certainly borne out of fear – a fear that if I don't, everything will fall apart.

Watching my own children, I can see their bond is complex and intense, full of extreme displays of frustration, resentment but also intimacy and love. I hope they can sustain that closeness in adulthood without the rivalry that seems so second nature to them now.

'Many of us were managers before we were parents, so it can help to think of it as delegation,' says Gardner. 'When you delegate something, you don't expect the other person to do it precisely as you would.' A child's picture of success is different from yours, so be careful not to impose your values on them.

Boys are born six weeks behind girls developmentally, a gap that widens throughout childhood right up to puberty, by which time they are two years behind. In infancy, boys cry more, take longer to settle, are slower to learn to walk, talk and potty train. They have more difficulty adapting to school. Reading, writing, sitting still all come harder to small boys. Socially, too, they lag behind girls. Behavioural problems and mental illnesses are more common at all ages in boys than girls. In adolescence, boys do less well at school, leave school earlier, and are more likely than girls to die, in road accidents, from substance abuse, in fights and by suicide. The vast majority of young offenders are boys.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

But you can't just sit them down and say ""talk to me"" like you might with a girl. You have to come at it sideways.' Perhaps the hardest task of all for mothers is knowing how and when to let their sons go. As boys mature, mothers have to let them push us away at times. As they get older, boys need to feel they're in charge of their lives. That means letting them make mistakes and letting them set their own boundaries.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Thankfully, we have moved away from the era of regarding children's play as a mere way to pass the time. It is now known that play is essential to a child's development and wellbeing. Offering your child a mix of play opportunities is the ideal. Children need to imagine and they need to act out (as language is still not their main mode of expression) and play gives them a safe structure within which to do this and in a way which they can control (in contrast to the rest of a child's life which is heavily controlled by adults around them).",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

If the dirt gets in their mouths, don't freak out; they'll soon realize that dirt doesn't taste all that good and likely won't develop a habit for it. Most kids have this innate desire to get dirty, but in their modern lives this needs to be nurtured. Do your child a favor and encourage her to play with dirt!",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

His team's studies of kids' connections with extended family uncovered an important principle: ""the more kids know about their families, the stronger they are."" From the elementary age on, Duke says, the most important thing to do is simply make space for kids to hear family stories,"" says Duke.

That's when many parents turn to threats, force, and ordering kids around. One of the best ways to build a bridge between your reality and the child's is through empathy. When we practice empathy with our kids, we show respect for their feelings and their unique experience of the world. Practicing empathy shows that we are really listening, and that we understand their point of view. Not respecting our children's reality is something we are generally unaware of doing.

Parents may be surprised to learn kids are feeling leery of sea creatures, or bothered by the sun, and take the opportunity to talk more about sharing the water with wildlife, or the importance of sunscreen—as well as getting across the absolute basics of beach safety: young kids shouldn't go into deep water, and should always stay near their parents or a lifeguard.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Parents can encourage play by following their child's lead, stepping in and out when needed, and going with their child's flow of play. Children structure their play very differently to how adults would, so it's important not to put your own agenda onto the play. I would argue there is no such thing as unhealthy play. If during active physical play children hit each other and become upset, then that kind of play can be discouraged, but otherwise the rest of the play time can be seen as healthy. Even moments of disagreement can be healthy as they are valuable opportunities for children to learn about themselves and others through developing skills of negotiation.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

It's a limited freedom that lets them explore their free will. Later, you will attach consequences to these choices – if you make the wrong choice, then there is a price to be paid.

2431,"Various sources have different estimates of how long it takes to learn a language. But the more time you are immersed in the language, the faster you will learn. This does not mean sitting in class looking out the window, nor listening to other students who do not speak well, nor getting explanations in your own language about how the language works. This means spending time enjoyably connected to the language you are learning. Start to notice words and how they come together as phrases. Learn these words and phrases through your listening and reading. Read online, using online dictionaries, and make your own vocabulary lists for review. Soon you will run into your new words and phrases elsewhere. Gradually you will be able to use them.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2,-2
2432,"One of the steps to success in learning a language is to take responsibility for your own learning. Choose content of interest, that you want to listen to, watch and read. Talk to your friends when you are ready to do it but don't wait for the perfect moment. Not only a teacher can teach you to become fluent, but also you can learn yourself to become fluent if you want to.
Enjoy studying all the time and stop worrying about what you cannot remember, or cannot yet understand, or cannot yet say. The language will gradually become clearer in your brain, but this will happen on a schedule that you cannot control. Just make sure you spend enough time with the language. That is the greatest guarantee of success.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2,-2
2433,"The biggest problem most people face in learning a new language is their own fear. They worry that they won't say things correctly or that they will look stupid so they don't talk at all. Don't do this. Like anything, learning English requires practice. Don't let a little fear stop you from getting what you want.
Even if you study English at a language school it doesn't mean you can't learn outside the class. Using as many different sources, methods and tools as possible, will allow you to learn faster.
Listen to podcasts and repeat after a speaker, listen to the radio, find new phrases and learn them by heart. The more English you have around you, the faster you will learn and the more likely you will begin ""thinking in English.""",learning languages,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3
2434,"Do you have problems with English spelling?
It's notoriously difficult. But you aren't the only ones who find it difficult. A recent study has shown that native English speakers can't spell either. More than two thousand people took part in the study and the findings were very interesting. Even relatively simple words such as ""calendar"", ""library"" and ""receipt"" caused difficulties. But this doesn't seem to worry many people. Nearly a third thought their spelling was ""brilliant"", and 46% said it was just ""good"". James Margate, who was in charge of the study said, ""It's interesting to see that despite getting basic words wrong, a huge majority still regard their spelling skills as excellent or good. If something isn't done in this generation, spelling standards will only decline further.""",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2,-2
2435,"Ron is a polyglot who thinks that listening is the key to language learning. Why?
""Because developing a good listening comprehension ability opens the door for other skills to flourish."" One of his top tips is the ""Radio in the Background Trick"". This involves having the radio playing in the background while you're studying. It's a form of subconscious learning, but it's not entirely passive.
As he explains, ""I keep the radio on all day while I'm working, tuned in to a station that's broadcast in the language I'm studying. Throughout the day, something will catch my attention. Maybe it's a clearly spoken commercial. Or it's a song I like. I'll stop and listen and try to understand it. I don't treat this like it's studying.""",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2,-2

He had no problems travelling through England. But he had to cancel his trip in France. He couldn't speak French. So, many people thought he was an asylum seeker and didn't help him. He said, ""I had to reassess the whole situation because I was out of food and hadn't slept in days."" He added, ""I feel very disappointed to have abandoned the trip.

Franglais words consist of English words that the French use as part of their everyday language. For example, the French often use the word ""le weekend"" to refer to… the weekend. Of course, many people in France aren't happy about this. Some even see it as a cultural attack. As a result, the Toubon Law was passed in 1994. This was an attempt to restrict the use of English words in French. The law makes French compulsory in government publications, most workplaces, advertisements, parts of the media and state-funded schools.",learning languages,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
2438,"Some words are easier to learn than others. However, some words are just really hard to learn as they just don't seem to have any relation to any other words you know. So, what can you do? Use mnemonics! Visual mnemonics with pictures or images are really good for learning words. In order to create your own visual mnemonic, you need to think about the word. What does it sound like? What does it make you think of? What does it rhyme with? Once you've established this, you can create an image that captures the word in your mind. And in order for this to work, your images need to be clear, distinct, strong and, if possible, a little bit crazy. Finally, write a sentence with your new word to help you remember it.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2,-2

You're also seeing how words fit together and how language structures are used. Plus, as you're reading, you're finding out about interesting things, which could give you something to talk about in conversation. The key is to read things you want to read. When you're interested in something, you focus on the content, not the language. This means you learn without even realising it. So, choose a topic that motivates you: sport, film, music, marketing, business, technology… the options are limitless.

Write them down in sentences and include any other information such as how to pronounce them or any synonyms and antonyms. Read a bit every day. And set mini-objectives. For example, if you're reading a book, aim to read 10 pages a day. If possible, read things in your own language first, and then try them in English. As you're already familiar with the topic or story, you'll find it easier to read in English. Reading should be fun, so choose texts that aren't too difficult for you. The best thing is to read at your level or slightly higher. If reading feels too much like work, it'll stop being enjoyable.",learning languages,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

This is far more motivating and realistic."" You might be feeling wildly optimistic when you start but aiming to be fluent is not necessarily the best idea.

For Aaron Ralby, director of Linguisticator, this debate misses the point: ""The question is not so much about online vs offline or app vs book. Rather it should be how can we assemble the necessary elements of language for a particular objective, present them in a user-friendly way, and provide a means for students to understand those elements."" When signing up to a particular method or approach, think about the substance behind the style or technology.

You can find local conversation groups and language cafes in libraries and community centres.

The accountability that comes with lessons creates a boost of ongoing motivation that is almost impossible to find for free. Most private tutors will offer you a free or cheap trial lesson. These don't mean there is a hidden obligation to buy. Instead, a good tutor will want to learn as much as possible about you before charging you money. Once you get started, it's easy to get past the idea that studying a foreign language comes with a big financial burden.

Use them to keep track of new words, write down new sentences in full and create your own flash cards. The theory of deliberate practice shows that it's not your language learning talent that makes the difference, but the amount of time you spend in concentrated and deliberate practice.

Then start with these three–oregano, sage, and rosemary. They smell nice, need basic care, and are perennial, which means you'll never have to buy them at the grocery store again.
Instead of growing them from seed, save time and trouble by purchasing plants from your local garden center. Herbs need lots of sun.
Unless you have a very bright window, you'll find them easier to grow outdoors than indoors. They also require excellent drainage. If you're growing them in pots, use a brand-name potting soil and make sure the containers have drainage holes. Outdoors, avoid planting in heavy clay soil and wet spots.

Also in the survey, 71% of houseworkers said that running the family-home was a full-time job. A nanny in the UK would earn about €48 a day for the same job. Cleaning and tidying for one hour would earn a cleaner almost €8. And for more than an hour of cooking, a chef would earn €20.

One trick is to find some aspect of your work at which you excel, however seemingly irrelevant.

Work stress often isn't the result of having too much to do, but rather fearing you'll forget something. To feel calmer, you need to find ways to enhance the feeling of control. Two principles are crucial here. The first is what the productivity guru David Allen calls 'universal capture'. Make sure that wherever you are – in the bathroom, at the gym – you have some way to take a note when tasks spring to mind. The second is to keep matters simple. Here's one basic system: designate one 'collection zone' where you collect everything still to be dealt with – papers, scribbled notes.

In some areas coal is burned to produce the electricity that powers people's homes. In a very few parts of the world, an interesting third form of heat energy comes from ""living"" heat inside the Earth itself.

One excellent aspect of water power is that the water can be reused. Unlike such fuels as coal and oil, water does not get used up when harnessed for power. And it doesn't pollute the air either. The power of water lies in the flow of water. The power produced by water depends upon the water's weight and its height of fall, called ""head.""

In the United States TV didn't find much of an audience in the beginning. People preferred radio programs. Early TV was black and white, the pictures were small and fuzzy, and the sound wasn't great. But when the 1947 World Series of baseball was shown on TV, many Americans watched and afterward decided to buy TV sets. The first TV programs—mostly comedies, variety shows, soap operas, and dramas—were based on popular radio shows.

Marconi knew that energy can travel in invisible waves through the air and that these waves could be captured electronically to send and receive signals. His invention allowed people to send messages to each other over great distances without having to be connected by wires. Marconi and others added to his invention, figuring out how to add sound to these messages to make the first radios. These were used simply for sending and receiving messages. During World War I the armed forces used radios for this purpose. It was after the war that radio became popular as a means of entertainment.",inventions,4,Intermediate,2,-2

That's when television began to catch on. And as it happens, television actually works in the same basic ways as radio does! It uses special equipment to send and receive pictures and sound in the form of electronic signals. Today radio technology is used in many ways. Cordless telephones, cellular phones, and garage-door openers all use radio technology. And radio entertainment programs are still going strong.",inventions,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

Later, the film is edited by cutting out parts that the director doesn't want. The parts being kept are then put together to tell the story. The sound and the pictures are joined together on a single piece of film to create the finished movie. The director has total control over how the story will be filmed.

Dirty water makes people and animals sick when they drink it or wash or live in it. It also kills plants. If land takes in too much waste, nothing will grow on it, and it becomes unfit to live on. Stopping pollution isn't easy. Most people find it hard to change the way they live, even if they want to. And governments and big companies find it even harder to change, since the changes are often unpopular or costly. Even small changes help, however. Reusing things instead of throwing them away helps.

Some people think organic means locally grown. Originally this was true. Over time organic farming became more difficult. The demand for organic food grew larger than the supply.

In the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, you can rent horses and pack mules and ride for days in unspoiled wilderness without seeing another person. Nearly every state offers a wide choice of hiking trails, backpacking areas and campgrounds. Some states offer unique wilderness experiences.",views of the americas,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
2759,"At the heart of South America lies the Amazon River basin. It is nearly as large as the United States, but few people live there. Nonetheless, the area is full of living things. They are all part of a giant tropical forest called the rainforest. There are so many plants, animals, birds, and insects there that no one has been able to list them all! Some of them exist nowhere else in the world. The rainforest is a very important place. It helps control the world's climate by absorbing gases in the air that can cause a problem called global warming. It also provides a home for the many animals in the area. There are bright-colored birds, including green and yellow parrots with red heads, pink flamingos, and beautiful hummingbirds.",views of the americas,4,Intermediate,2,-2

In addition to preserving its multitude of geothermal attractions, Yellowstone National Park serves as a refuge for a wide variety of native American wildlife.

It was like a two-and-a-half-hour performance, but they were unbelievable! It was great! The next day we attended the actual competition and were ranked as being superior, which is the best ranking of course.

We ate way too much ice cream and stayed up way too late because I had to get up early Saturday morning and go to school to help with landscaping for community service.
At my school, a certain number of hours of community service are required each year, so I choose things I like.

At 6:00 I head back to the pool. I coach a night practice. After practice, like 9-ish, I spend time with the family. We play Wii or watch a movie.

Later, we took a bus back to where we were staying. I roomed with three people, and our room was connected to a room with three more boys and one of my friends' dad. That night people were sick. It was from riding Everest.
On the fourth day we went to MGM, and they closed a section of the roller coaster just for the eighth graders. They closed down that part of the park for us and that was the most fun.

We were in Wisconsin, and there aren't a lot of Spanish speakers in Wisconsin. The teachers would take me out of class to learn English.
This summer we'll probably go to Myrtle Beach. It's a whole family trip. We go to the beach or hang out at the pool at the hotel. We go out to eat and to the fun park.

Do you know what you'd like to do after high school?
Not really. I have a faint idea. I'd like to go into science or engineering. We did a career finder thing on the computer at school, and it suggested science or engineering for me.

There are a lot of other teams in that league. And my birthday is in four days and I'll be fourteen.
How will you celebrate?
I don't know. I'll probably go play laser tag or something.
I think your parents are divorced. Is that right?
Yeah. I live with my mom normally, and every Thursday I go to my dad's for the evening, from 6:00 to 9:00. Every other weekend I go to my dad's house and stay from Friday to Sunday, and then I go back to my mom's.",teens talk,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

Near the river we found Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and two or three other boys hiding. We climbed into a small boat and traveled two and a half miles down the river before we stopped the boat and went ashore.
Tom led us to some bushes where he made everyone promise to keep his secret. He pushed aside the bushes and showed us a hole in the hill. We lit our candles and used them to light our way through the hole and into a large cave. Soon we came to a kind of underground room where we stopped. Tom said, ""Now we'll start our club and call it Tom Sawyer's Club.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2847,"Tom wrote the program of his club on a sheet of paper and read it to us. All the boys had to promise that they would never tell any of the club's secrets. If they did, other members of the club would kill them and would burn their dead bodies. Some boys thought that it would be a good idea to also kill the families of the boys who told club secrets. Tom added this to the promise.
Then Ben Rogers said, ""Huck Finn doesn't have a family. How can we let him join the club?"" ""Well, he has a father,"" said Tom Sawyer.
""Yes, he has a father, but you can never find him. The boys talked about this problem. They decided that I could not join their club. I became very sad and felt like crying. Then I thought of a solution to my problem. ""Miss Watson can be part of my family.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2849,"One morning, while I was eating breakfast, I poured some salt on the table. It was an accident. I knew that it was bad luck to acci­dentally pour salt and that the only way to get rid of the bad luck was to throw some salt over my left shoulder. But Miss Watson stopped my hand and shouted, ""Take your hands away from that salt, Huckleberry. You've already made the table dirty. Don't make it dirtier."" I knew that I couldn't stop the bad luck; it would follow me always. I quickly left the table and ran out of the house. I was worried and frightened. I knew that something bad was going to happen to me, but I didn't know where or when it would happen.
I walked through the front garden and climbed over a high fence. Snow was on the ground, and I could see tracks made by a man's shoes in the snow.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2850,"I stood up quickly and was soon running down the hill. I looked over my shoulder, but didn't see anyone following me. I ran to Judge Thatcher's house as quickly as I could.
""Hello, Huckleberry, why have you been running? Did you come to ask me about your money? Do you need a few dollars?"" ""No, sir,"" I answered. ""Did the bank send you some money for me?""
""Yes, more than 150 dollars. That's a large amount of money. I would like to keep it for you, together with your 6,000 dollars. If I give you all the money now, you'll only spend it on foolish things."" ""I don't want to spend my money. I don't even want it ever. Not even the 6,000 dollars. I want you to have it. I want to give all my money to you.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2851,"I went to Jim and told him about the tracks that I had seen in the snow. I told him that I knew that Pap was in town again because I knew that he had made a cross with two nails in the heel of his left shoe. I wanted to know what Pap was planning to do. Would he stay in St. Petersburg a long time?
Jim took his hair ball and said some words over it. Then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. The hair ball rolled a short distance. Jim did this several times, but the hair ball acted the same each time. Jim put his ear against it and listened, but he heard nothing. He said that the hair ball would not talk unless I gave him some money. I gave Jim twenty-­five cents, and he put the money under the hair ball. This time the hair ball talked to Jim, and he told me what it said.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2853,"""Be careful what you say to me. I've been in this town for two days and all the people tell me how rich you are. I heard about your money when I was far away down the river. That's why I am here. I want your money. I want you to get it for me tomorrow."" ""I don't have any money."" ""You're telling a lie. Judge Thatcher has your money. Get the money from him! I want it!"" ""I don't have any money. Please believe me. Ask Judge Thatcher. He'll tell you that I have no money."" ""I'll ask him tomorrow. I'll force him to give me your money. How much money do you have in your pocket?"" ""I have only a dollar, and I want it to—"" ""I don't care why you want it. Give it to me now."" Pap took the dollar and said that he was going into town to buy something.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2854,"Pap again went to court to try to force judge Thatcher give him my money. He also tried to stop me from attending school. When he saw me going to school, he would catch me and beat me. But I continued to go to school, and tried to prevent Pap from seeing me. I wasn't happy going to school before, but now I went because I knew that it made Pap unhappy. Some days I would ask Judge Thatcher for two or three dollars, which I gave to Pap. He would buy whiskey with the money and get very drunk and start fights with men in town.
Pap began coming to the widow's house to see me. She told him to stay away or she would cause trouble for him. This made him very angry. He told her that he had authority over his son and she couldn't tell him how he must act around his son, what he could and could not do to me.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2856,"Pap stayed away from the cabin often. Once he stayed away for three days, and I was locked inside alone. I didn't enjoy that. When he was away for long periods of time, I began to worry that he would never return. What would happen to me? I could die locked inside the cabin. I began to think of a way to escape. I found an old dirty saw that Pap didn't know was in the cabin. With this tool, I began to saw a hole through one of the logs in the wall behind my bed. I wanted to make a hole large enough to climb through and escape. Making such a hole was going to take a long time, and I worked at it whenever Pap was out of the cabin. I kept the saw hidden while Pap was home. When Pap would leave, I pushed the bed away from the wall and sawed at the log.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2863,"I put on my old clothes and ran away and was free and happy, but Tom Sawyer found me and said that if I want­ed to join his club and be friends, I would have to return to live with the widow. For this reason, I returned to live with her.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2865,"Tom and I walked quietly along a path among the trees. When we passed near the widow's kitchen, I fell and made a noise. We lay very still. Miss Watson's black slave, Jim, was sitting in the kitchen door.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

2868,"At the beginning, I hated school very much, but after a while, I hated it less. Whenever I began to hate school, I simply stayed away a few days.

2874,"I began to make a plan; I would take Pap's gun and walk through the forest as far as I could go. I would walk mostly at night and would hunt animals for food. I would travel far away, and neither Pap nor the widow would find me again.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2875,"It was late at night, and I became very tired. I don't know how long I slept, but suddenly I heard a loud scream and was awake. Pap looked wild and was running around the cabin shouting about poisonous snakes.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2876,"Pap unlocked the door, and I walked along the river until I found a good place to fish. The river was much deeper than it was normally and was flowing much faster. Several large logs floated down the river. I became excited.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2877,"The next day, Pap caught me alone near the river. He pushed me into a small boat, and we traveled three miles up the Mississippi. We crossed to the Illinois shore to a place where there were many trees and no houses.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

2882,"All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, ""Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end. Of course, they lived at 14 (their house number on their street), and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind.",peter pan part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.",peter pan part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
2901,"Mr. Darling came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
""Why, what is the matter, father dear?""
""Matter!"" he yelled; he really yelled. ""This tie, it will not tie.""
He became dangerously sarcastic.
""Not round my neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no; begs to be excused!""
He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, ""I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner tonight, and if I don't go out to dinner tonight, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.""",peter pan part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

2910,"Wendy explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.

Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side tonight, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling, the smallest of all the stars screamed out: ""Now, Peter!""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.
There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light. It was a girl called Tinker Bell.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
2933,"Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there.
""And I know you meant to be kind,"" she said, relenting, ""so you may give me a kiss.""
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses.
""I thought you would want it back,"" he said a little bitterly, and offered to return her the thimble.
""Oh dear,"" said the nice Wendy, ""I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.""
""What's that?""
""It's like this."" She kissed him.
Peter thimbled her, and immediately she screeched. ""What is it, Wendy?""
""It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.""
""That must have been Tink.""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
2935,"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and hurried to the window.
""Where are you going?"" Wendy cried with misgiving.
""To tell the other boys.""
""Don't go Peter,"" she entreated, ""I know such lots of stories.""
Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him.
He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her, but did not.
""Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!"" she cried, and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.
""Let me go!"" she ordered him.
""Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.""
Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, ""Oh dear, I can't. Think of mummy! Besides, I can't fly.""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
2937,"""Of course it's awfully fascinating!"" she cried. ""Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?""
""If you like,"" he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael and shook them.
""Wake up,"" she cried, ""Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly.""
John rubbed his eyes. ""Then I shall get up,"" he said. Of course he was on the floor already.
""Hello,"" he said, ""I am up!""
Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

""It's all right,"" John announced, emerging from his hiding- place. ""I say, Peter, can you really fly?""
Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way.
""How topping!"" said John and Michael.
""How sweet!"" cried Wendy.
""Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!"" said Peter, forgetting his manners again.
It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
""I say, how do you do it?"" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a practical boy.
""You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,"" Peter explained. He showed them again.
""You're so nippy at it,"" John said, ""couldn't you do it very slowly once?""
Peter did it both slowly and quickly.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

2969,"Sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.
""I'm Wendy,"" she said agitatedly.
He was very sorry.
""I say, Wendy,"" he whispered to her, ""always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.""
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security.

In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy.

Scientists can speed up the growth by modifying, or changing, the structure of plants' genes. The modifications make them react quickly to changes in light.

Steve Long is a plant biologist with the University of Illinois. ""Arguably, photosynthesis is the most important process on our planet. It is the driving force behind all of life.""

3577,"Four public high schools named as the best in the United States have much in common.
The top four schools are: Stuyvesant High School in New York City; High Technology High School in New Jersey; Staten Island Technical High School in New York City; and Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia.
The children who get into these top schools have many advantages. For example, classes at Stuyvesant are similar to ""those of a small college"". Going to school with so many gifted students can push teenagers to do their best. But it can also put students under a lot of pressure to keep up.
What everyone likes about these schools is that the school's counselors and teachers ""work hard"" to serve all students, ""not just those with the best grades.""",education,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

Some are hard-boiled, while others are not. Both kinds of eggs look the same. How can the children know which is which, without breaking them open?
The students at Mundo Verde have to think scientifically to solve this mystery. One fifth grader, Samadhi, says she had to try more than one idea to recognize a difference between the eggs.
""It was kind of difficult, but it was fun too. You get to try new things, you don't have to do what the teacher tells you.""
Samadhi discovered that spinning the eggs solved the problem. Raw eggs spin more slowly than hard-boiled ones because the liquid inside slows them down.",education,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

And Santa Clara University in California has a program called ""The Joy of Garbage.""

As he lifted himself on his elbow, he was frightened by a loud noise. There was a caribou looking at him curiously. The animal was not more than 50 feet away, and instantly, into the man's mind came the picture of caribou meat cooking over a fire. From habit, he reached for the empty gun and aimed it. The caribou leaped away and disappeared across the rocks.
The man cursed and threw the empty gun on the ground. He uttered a cry of pain as he started to drag himself to his feet. It was a slow task.

But he knew that it weighed 15 pounds—as much as all the rest of the pack. This worried him. He finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack.

It was a fearful cry, but the animal, leaping away in fright, did not drop the bird.
Late in the afternoon he followed a stream which flowed through some thick grass. He grasped these grasses firmly near the root and pulled up what looked like a vegetable.

He plunged his whole arm in, but the fish escaped his grasp. He reached for it with both hands and stirred the mud at the bottom of the pool. During his excitement he fell in, getting wet as high as his shoulders. Then the water was too cloudy with mud to allow him to see the fish.

Through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and of food served in all imaginable manners. When he awakened he was cold and sick. There was no sun. The gray of earth and sky had become deeper. A cold wind was blowing and snow was whitening the hilltops. The air about him grew white with snow while he made a fire and boiled more water. It was wet snow, half rain.

He had not traveled more than ten miles that day. The next day, traveling whenever his heart permitted, he went no more than five miles. But his stomach did not give him any pain.

He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out of the ground, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he also got many pieces that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do.

Nowadays the winter weather is wet and windy rather than icy and snowy in the south. This is a shame really as the latter certainly makes us feel more festive as we approach Christmas. Our unpredictable weather is due to the moist air from the Atlantic to the south and west mixing with the dry continental air from mainland Europe to the east; with a bit of global warming added in.

We often ask our neighbours if they can put them in the field opposite more often to complete the quintessentially English view with the cows munching away on the grass in the foreground and the South Downs in the distance. The farmer separates them from their mothers at quite a young age so they can control the amount of milk they drink.

Normally I wouldn't complain, but it's getting to the stage where the rivers and lakes hereabouts are extremely low. The stream in our bottom field by the wood is very low indeed. Also, the stream by the old corn mill is completely dry and what is usually a rushing stream with wild garlic growing in the spring time, is now a gully full of dry leaves.
Generally, we complain about the weather here, but to be honest we could do with a week or so of downpours to restore water levels; at night only though please so we can still enjoy the outdoors in the daytime.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Gradually the green countryside turns into the multi-coloured cityscape; it takes about 50 minutes. Once at Victoria Station, I need to change onto the Underground to get to Piccadilly Circus, so up one stop to Green Park on the Victoria Line, then one stop East on the Piccadilly Line.

The river Ouse, the river Adur and their tributaries are constantly under pressure from pollution and assessing the invertebrate population is an excellent way of knowing the status of a watercourse. He and two colleagues then proceeded to climb down a ladder into the stream, carried out their survey and promised to email me the results.

The birds start singing their hearts out and building nests and the plants and trees go into overdrive. One of the first signs of spring for me is when the swallows come back from their travels to Africa and spend the warmer months in the British Isles. They swoop low over the lake snapping flies out of the air, then go and chatter to each other on the telegraph lines or on the beams in the barns. I recently took a photo of some fledgling swallows I saw doing just this.

The asparagus grows in early to mid-spring, and looks like fingers growing out of the ground. It almost grows while you watch. You can pick it all and then the next day, it's back! We're very lucky to have two asparagus beds which were planted by the previous owners of the farm.

It reminds me a little bit of the traditional opening scene of Downton Abbey; all the bustling preparations by the staff to get the house ready for an event.

Last Easter we had 'Storm Katie' which was much fiercer than Angus and it blew the kids' trampoline away down as far as the vegetable patch; how rude! It narrowly missed taking out one of the greenhouses and the power lines in between; we counted ourselves lucky there.

We have attended the fair for a couple of years now and we enjoy showing our support as well as having the opportunity to see some farming machinery (which our sons love) and meeting friends.
This year we decided to take our tractor to the show, as it's a very fine example, to show it off. Once at the fair, we got chatting to a chap who is writing a book about vintage tractors and he was very enthusiastic about ours.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2,-2

We are positively drowning in peas, courgettes, runner beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and raspberries. It's lovely to pick the crop and then be eating it half an hour later; you can't get much fresher than that! It's a great way to get healthy vitamin-packed food into the kids as they love to help pick and prepare it. They also understand where it all comes from rather than just from a supermarket shelf.
The apples in the orchards are growing well too, although it'll still be a month or so before we can pick them to make into cider.

We've recently had Halloween; something we don't celebrate quite so much here as is done in other countries. In addition to this, we live in the middle of nowhere, there's no street lighting and we only have one neighbour, so we didn't 'Trick or Treat'.

But did you know that we actually see the sky through a 300-mile thick gaseous layer? This is the earth's atmosphere that makes up the air we breathe. In fact, this thin layer of gas protects us from the sun's rays. What's more this gaseous layer makes the sky blue as its molecules only absorb one color, blue, which gets scattered around the sky. However, when the sky turns red during a sunset, it means we're further away from the sun. The sun's light must pass through a denser atmospheric layer and blue light is too far away to make the distance. Only the color red filters through atmosphere.

The reason the brain works in this way so we can retain information better. If we put socks in a pot in the kitchen or stored them in a fridge, there would probably be something seriously wrong with the brain. That's how disorder starts. Parents tend to relate a messy room to a messy brain. Unless a child keeps a room in order he or she is unlikely to perform well at school. Parents have a point there.

Strangely enough, dessert plates are so small that sometimes there's barely enough room to fit three scoops of chocolate ice cream. Soup and similar dishes provide us with nourishment, so they come first to stuff ourselves and stop feeling hungry.

They noticed that one of these stars, the North Star, didn't move and other stars rotated around it. They chose it to be a point of reference. They divided up the sky into 36 sequences. When observing the summer sky, Egyptian astronomers noted that only twelve sequences of the sky crossed the North Star.

However, in the end, I decided to ask people instead. I'm patiently waiting for the first to come out and when he dries up I dare ask what made him decide to take up cold water swimming. Richard has been a swimmer here for three years, coming every morning before work. ""It's wonderful on the cold winter morning. I thought it would make me healthier and more resistant. In fact, I haven't been ill once since then. Above all, it helps me feel livelier and energetic at work.""",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
3777,"Olivia is another frequent swimmer here. She is a young mum of two kids who used to be seriously ill. One alternative doctor recommended her to try to get hardened. He told her that she could thus become fitter and it would help to cope with the illness. She believed the doctor and has been coming for a swim every other day. It took her a month to get used to diving into freezing water. Amazingly, but now she can't do without this habit, it's just as if she misses something. As for her health improvement, she is not completely over she feels much better though. The pool is open even if the temperature drops below zero and the water gets frozen. They break the ice in the middle so that you can swim in circles. I would like to be able to say that I too dived happily into the water and swam a couple of hundred of meters. But the truth is, fearing the worst, I walked very carefully into the pool, stood there almost in shock and then got out again after 30 seconds before I became a block of ice!",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
3778,"It might sound strange, but I've started thinking recently about the places people arrange to meet. The other day my old friend arranged to meet me outside the tube station in a quite rough area of London. My friend was late as usual since he is never in time. I had to wait for half an hour in the street, watching the police drive by and rain come down. While I was there, two men came up to me and asked for money and a tough guy told me, ""What are you looking at?"" I didn't feel scared but suddenly though, ""What am I doing here? Isn't it a terrible place to meet?"" When I was young, I used to meet at bus stops because I didn't want my parents to see who I was going out with. I didn't meet in a bar as I was afraid to be the first and face the manager asking me my age.",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
3780,"I grew up in Manchester in the 1950s and my dad supported Manchester City team, so did I. When we were watching together a game, he always used to say, ""You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your football team. It's part of your family history, part of who you are. Supporting a football club is about more than getting together with your pals in a bar to celebrate the victory or heckling a goal, which is added to the winning score. It's about hope and belief! Even when everything is going wrong and your team has just gone down to the Third Division or it's lost a big match against its local rivals, you have to believe that things will get better."" Even though my dad is long ago dead, his words are for me meaningful. I stick to them and never stop supporting the team of my family although it's not known to many football lovers at least as much as another team from my home town Manchester United.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
