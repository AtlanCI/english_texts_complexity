90,"One cold winter day a little girl and her father arrived in London. Sara Crewe was seven years old, and she had long black hair and green eyes.
She sat in the cab next to her father and looked out of the windows at the tall houses and the dark sky.
'What are you thinking about, Sara?' Mr. Crewe asked. 'You are very quiet.' He put his arm round his daughter.
'I am thinking about our house in India,' said Sara. 'And the hot sun and the blue sky. I don't think I like England very much, Father.' 'Yes, it's very different from India,' her father said.
'But you must go to school in London, and I must go back to India and work'.
'Yes, Father, I know', said Sara. 'But I want to be with you. Please come to school with me! I can help you with your lessons.' Mr. Crewe smiled, but he was not happy.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
92,"Mr. Crewe stayed in London for a week. He and Sara went to the shops, and he bought many beautiful, expensive dresses for his daughter.
He bought books, and flowers for her room, and a big doll with beautiful dresses, too.
Miss Minchin smiled, but she said to her sister Amelia: 'All that money on dresses for a child of seven! She looks like a little princess, not a schoolgirl!' When Mr. Crewe left London, he was very sad. Sara was very sad too, but she did not cry. She sat in her room and thought about her father on the ship back to India.
'Father wants me to be happy,' she said to her new doll. 'I love him very much and I want to be a good daughter, so I must be happy.' It was a very big, and very beautiful doll, but of course it could not answer.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
93,"Sara made few friends in the school. Some little rich girls are not very nice children—they think they are important because they have money and lots of expensive things. But Sara was different.
She liked beautiful dresses and dolls, but she was more interested in people, and books, and telling stories.
She was a clever child, and the other girls loved to listen to her. The stories were all about kings and queens and princesses and wonderful countries across the sea.
'How do you think of all those things?' asked her best friend, Ermengarde.
'I have all these pictures in my head,' said Sara. 'So it's easy to tell stories about them'.
Ermengarde learnt her lessons through Sara's stories, and she loved her friend very much. But not everybody was Sara's friend.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
94,"The next morning Sara's new life began. She learnt to clean floors and to make fires. She ran upstairs and downstairs, and she worked in the kitchen.
The cook was a big woman with a red, angry face.
'So,' she said, 'the little rich girl is now a servant?' She looked at Sara.
'Now, I'm making apple pies this morning. Run down to the shops and get me some apples. And be quick.' So Sara ran to the shops, and carried a big bag of apples back to the house. Then she cleaned the kitchen floor, and carried hot water up to all the bedrooms.
She worked everyday, from early in the morning to late at night.
'You speak French well,' Miss Minchin said to her coldly. 'So you can teach French to the younger children. But you're only a servant. Don't forget that.' So Sara continued to work as a servant.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
95,"The first months of Sara's new life were very hard. She was always tired and hungry, but she never cried. At night, in her little attic, she thought about her father, dead in India all those miles away.
'I must be brave,' she said. 'Father always wanted me to be brave. And I have a bed to sleep in, and something to eat every day. Lots of people don't have that.' At first Sara's only friend was Becky. Every day Becky came into Sara's bedroom. They did not talk much, but it helped Sara a lot to see Becky's friendly, smiling face. The girls in the school were sorry for Sara, but Sara was a servant now, and they could not be friendly with servants. Lavinia, of course, was pleased.
'I never liked Sara Crewe,' she told her friends. 'And I was right about the diamonds—there weren't any!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
98,"When Becky saw the room, she could not speak at first. Then she said, 'Oh, Miss! What is it? How did all these things get here?' 'I don't know,' said Sara. 'It's magic. At first I thought it was a dream, but it isn't. Look— these pies are hot. Let's eat them. Hot meat pies aren't a dream!' They sat down by the fire, and ate and drank.
'Oh, those pies were good, Miss!' Becky said, 'And the tea and the cake. I don't understand magic, but I like it!' Sara looked round the room. 'Oh Becky, look! There are some books, too. I didn't see them before.' She ran to look at them, and opened the top book. 'There's some writing here! Listen. It says, to the little girl in the attic. From a friend.' Sara closed the book and looked up. 'I have a friend, Becky,' she said slowly. 'Someone is my friend.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
99,"Every evening, when Sara went up to bed, she found new things in the attic. There were more warm blankets, for her and for Becky.
There were pictures on the walls; there were books, new shoes, and a winter coat. And best of all, there was always a fire.'
'Who does it, Miss?' 'A friend does it,' Sara said. 'A kind, wonderful friend. But he doesn't want us to know his name.' They began to look at one of the new books, and then Becky looked up.
'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'There's something at the window. What is it?' Sara got up to look. 'It's the monkey!' she said. 'The monkey from next door.' She opened the window, and the monkey jumped down into her arms. 'Oh, you poor little thing,' Sara said. 'You're so cold!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
101,"The story ended happily for everybody—but not for Miss Minchin. Sara was very rich now, and Miss Minchin wanted her to come back to the school.
She came to see Mr. Carrisford, but he said some very angry things to her, and she went away with red face.
Becky came to live in Mr. Carrisford's house, too. She was Sara's servant, and she was very happy. She had a warm room, nice dresses, beautiful dolls, and good things to eat every day. And she loved Sara very much. Another Sara's friend from school, Ermengarde, often came to visit Sara, and Sara helped her with her school lessons again. Ermengarde was not clever, but she was a true friend. They often play and read together. Ermengarde liked to listen to Sara's stories about everything in the world.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
104,"That evening, in the little attic room, Sara sat on the bed in her old black dress. She did not cry, but her face was white and she did not move or speak for hours.
Late at night the door opened quietly, and Becky looked in. Her eyes were red from crying.
'Oh, Miss,' she said. 'All the servants are talking about it. I'm so sorry!' She looked at Sara's white face, and began to cry again. Then she ran to Sara, and took her hand. At last Sara moved. Slowly, she turned her head and looked at Becky.
'Oh, Becky,' she said.
And that was all. That first night in the attic was very long. Sara did not sleep.
'Father is dead,' she whispered, again and again. 'Father is dead. I'm never going to see him again.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1
105,"Winter came, with its short, dark days, and the attic rooms were very cold. There were no fires for servant girls, and often Sara and Becky could not sleep because of the cold. Sara was taller now, and her old black dress was very short. Her shoes were old, and she had no warm coat for the winter weather. She was thin, too. She did not get very much to eat, and she was always hungry. She carried big baskets of shopping through the rain and the snow. One day she found a sixpence in the snow, and she bought some hot bread with it. Then she saw a child by the door of the shop.
The child had no shoes and no coat, and her thin face was blue with cold. 'She is hungrier than I am,' thought Sara. And she gave her hot new bread to the child.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0,-1

Would you like to go home to your people?' 'The English are my people now,' said Pocahontas.
'But perhaps one day your father—' said her friend.
'My father,' said Pocahontas, 'likes his guns better than his daughter. They are more important to him. This is my home now.' One of her new friends was a man called John Rolfe. Pocahontas liked him.

At first, Pocahontas didn't say anything. John Rolfe was a nice man, but a long time ago, she remembered, she wanted to be the wife of a different John. 'But I'm never going to see John Smith again,' she thought. 'He's dead. I must forget about him.' She smiled at John Rolfe. 'Yes, John,' she said. 'I would very much like to be your wife.'

Pocahontas' son, Thomas, lived with the Rolfe family in England when he was a child, but in 1635 he went to live in Virginia. John Smith did not leave England again.

'But his clothes are poor, and his horse is old. Good! I think my friend, the sheriff, is right. Sir Richard cannot pay my one thousand, one hundred pounds. So this evening, I will be Lord of his house and his lands!' A few minutes later, Sir Richard and Little John came into the room.

Robin's men brought them food. The food was very good, but the churchmen couldn't eat. They were too afraid.
'Not hungry?' asked Robin. 'Please eat more because we will ask you to pay something for your dinner. With a little church gold, we can help the abbot's villagers. On the abbot's land there are many poor families.' 'We are only poor churchmen,' they answered, 'and we have no money. Please don't kill us!'

He told Sir Richard about the two churchmen and the bags of gold under their clothes.
'Now,' said Robin, 'I would like to give you and your lady something. I would like to give your wife this beautiful white horse. And for you, I have some fine clothes!'

I will not marry the sheriff. Listen. Tomorrow I will leave the house very early. The sheriff will come late in the morning. Tell your men to look for me. Look in every room. Be very angry.

'This is an important officer,' he thought. He jumped up to meet him, but the soldiers pushed him back.

He looked at the officer. He tried to make his voice quiet and calm.
'I only want to know what is going to happen to me. Why am I here? Give me your permission to see a judge.'
'Perhaps,' said the chief officer. Then, turning to the governor, he said, 'Show me your books. What is this man's crime?'

Suddenly, one evening, at about nine o'clock, Edmond heard a sound in the wall next to his bed. He listened.
'Perhaps this is only a dream, too,' he thought.
But he heard the sound again. He heard something fall — and then silence.
Some hours later, he heard the noise again, nearer and more clearly.
Edmond listened. 'I know what that sound is,' he thought. 'A prisoner is trying to escape.'
Edmond wanted to help. He moved his bed, then he looked round the room for a sharp tool. The only things in the room were a bed, a chair, a table, and a water pot.
'I will break the water pot and use one of the sharp pieces,' he thought.
He threw the pot on the floor, and it broke into pieces. He hid two or three pointed bits in his bed.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'Is it you?' he said. 'I am here.'
Soon after that, part of the floor of Dantes' room fell away. Stones and earth fell down into the opening. Then, at the bottom of the hole, Dantes saw the arms and head of a man. The man climbed up into the room.
Dantes reached his hands out to his new friend. He was a small man, and his hair was white. His eyes were dark, and he had a long beard. He was not strong.
'You seem very happy to see me!' he said to Dantes. 'Your happiness touches my heart.'
But Dantes knew that the man was very sad.

'I work all night.'
'At night? Can you see in the dark?'
'No, of course not. But God has given man a mind. With it, we can make what we need. I made a lamp for myself. I get the oil from my food, and it burns very well.'
Faria's words were clever and wise. Sometimes Dantes could not understand them.
'You are very wise. Will you teach me?' Dantes asked. 'I don't want you to get tired of me. A clever person doesn't want to talk to a person who knows nothing. Teach me, and then the hours will pass more quickly for you.'

'I can jump over the side of the ship,' Dantes thought, 'and swim to the island in an hour. But if I do that, how will I get the treasure away? I must wait. I waited for years to be free. I can wait for a few months to be rich.'
He looked again at the island.
'Perhaps the treasure is only a dream, a dream of Faria's. But there was Prince Spada's letter. That seemed real.'
Dantes repeated the letter to himself from the beginning to the end; he remembered every word.
Night came, and Edmond watched the island. It was beautiful with the colours of the evening, then slowly it hid itself in the darkness.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'How can I reach Monte Cristo? I have no money for a small boat to get it.'
One evening, in Livorno, the captain asked Dantes to come to an important meeting.
Edmond went with the captain to see other ships' captains. They talked about a ship from Turkey which was carrying expensive cloth. They wanted to find a quiet place and meet this ship, buy the cloth and then take it to the coast of France.
'We need a quiet place where there are no customs officers,' one man said. 'A place where nobody will see us.'
'The best place is the island of Monte Cristo,' said the captain of the Young Amelia. 'Nobody lives on the island, and no customs officers ever go there.' They decided to sail to Monte Cristo the next night.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

In Genoa he saw a boat builder. The man had a beautiful little ship on the water.
'I built this boat for an Englishman,' the boat builder said.
It was very small.
'I can sail it myself, alone, without help,' Dantes thought. 'And it is very fast. No other ship on the water will catch it.'
Dantes offered a lot of money for the boat and asked the builder for the ship's papers.
'The Englishman will not return for some time,' the boat builder said. 'I am sure that I can build another boat for him.'
Dantes said, 'Make me a hidden place on the ship, near the top of my bed.'
The builder promised to do the work the next day.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

The customs officers came on board to look at the ship's papers.
A soldier stood near the steps. Even now, Dantes was afraid when he saw a soldier. Edmond now had a different name — a rich man's name. He showed the officers the ship's papers.
'This boat is owned by the Count of Monte Cristo,' the papers said.
'The count can go on shore now, if he wants to,' they said. 'There is no problem with his papers.'

He returned to the treasure place and went into the second room. He took gold and some coins and hid them safely in his clothing. Then he covered the chest with earth, and put sand over the place.
'Nobody can see anything now,' he thought. He put a large stone over the opening and covered it with earth.
He waited for his friends to return. That was not easy. He did not want to sit and guard his great treasure. He wanted to return and live with men.

It was dark, but he saw the old, white-faced man holding on to the end of his bed in great pain.
'Ah, my dear friend,' said Faria. You know that the time has come.'
'Don't say that!' cried Dantes. I will save you again.'
He quickly lifted up the foot of the bed and took out the little bottle. There was still some red liquid in it.
'Look,' he cried. 'There is still some in here. Tell me what to do.'
'There is no hope,' Faria replied. 'But you can try to save my life. Do the same thing, but don't wait too long. If I don't get better, pour the rest into my mouth. Now put me on my bed.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'In two or three hours,' he thought, 'the guard will go into my room. He will find the body of my poor friend. He will look for me and not find me, and then he will call for help. The soldiers will discover underground path. They will question the men who threw me into the sea. They will send boats of soldiers to find the escaped prisoner.

It came near him. He shouted and waved his hand. The ship turned towards him, and let down a boat.
There were two men in the boat. Dantes began to swim to it, but he was too weak. He gave a cry, and one of the men in the boat shouted, 'Be strong! We are coming!'
Dantes heard their words. A wave passed over him. He came up to the top of the water, and then he went down again. The water closed over his head.
'I am dying!' he thought.

""Hello, Marilla,"" said Mrs. Lynde. ""I saw Matthew on the road. Where's he going?""
""To Bright River Station,"" answered Marilla. ""We're getting a little boy from an orphanage in Nova Scotia. He's coming on the train this afternoon.""

When Matthew arrived at Bright River, it was late. There was only one person at the station, a little girl about eleven years old. She was very thin with large gray eyes and long red hair. When she saw Matthew, she smiled.
""Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?"" she asked. ""I'm from the orphanage.""
Matthew took the child's hand. ""There's a mistake,"" he thought. ""This is a girl, not a boy!""
""When you weren't here at the station,"" said the child, ""I thought, 'I can sleep in that big tree tonight. I know you'll come in the morning.' I know it's a long way to your house.

They only gave us ugly clothes at the orphanage. I know I'm going to be very happy with you. But one thing makes me sad. Look at my hair. What color is it?""

Marilla looked for the brooch again, but she couldn't find it.
""Anne,"" she said, ""I'll ask you again. Did you take the brooch from my room and lose it?""

She went to Anne's room. ""Anne, why did you tell me that story this morning?"" she said. ""The brooch is here on my coat.""
""I wanted to go to the party,"" said Anne sadly. ""You wanted me to tell you about the brooch. So I had to think of a story.""

One day, there was a new boy in school. He was tall, with brown hair. The girls liked him.
""That's Gilbert Blythe,"" Diana said to Anne. ""His family went away for the summer. They came back on Saturday.""
Gilbert's desk was near Anne's desk. He often looked at her.
He wanted her to look at him, too. She was different from the other girls in Avonlea. But Anne wasn't interested in Gilbert.
Gilbert took Anne's hair in his hand. ""Carrots!"" he said loudly.

The next afternoon, Anne went to tea with Mrs. Allan. ""I had a wonderful time with Mrs. Allan,"" she told Marilla later. ""She's very kind. And she wore a beautiful dress. We talked for a long time. I told her about Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond, and the orphanage. I told her about Green Gables and the school, too.""

One of the girls climbed the tree. Then another girl thought of something more exciting. ""Who can climb up to the top of Diana's house?"" she said.
""I can!"" cried Anne. She ran to the house.
""Stop, Anne! "" called Diana. ""That's very dangerous!""
Anne started to climb to the top of the house, but it was very difficult. Suddenly, she fell to the ground. When Anne opened her eyes, her face was very white.

One evening, Matthew went into the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne's friends were there. They laughed and talked about the concert. Matthew watched them.
""Anne looks different from the other girls. But why?"" he thought. He thought all evening, then suddenly he knew the answer. ""Anne's clothes are different,"" he thought. ""Marilla makes good dresses for Anne, but they aren't very pretty.""

""Oh yes, Matthew,"" answered Anne. ""I love the dress. It's beautiful. Thank you! I'm crying because I'm very happy.""
That night, Anne wore her new dress to the concert. She said her two poems very well. Matthew and Marilla were at the concert, too. Later, they sat by the kitchen fire and talked.
""Anne did very well tonight,"" said Matthew.
""Yes,"" said Marilla. ""She's very smart. And she looked very nice in her new dress.""

""Oh yes, Marilla,"" said Anne, and her eyes shone. ""But isn't Queen's College very expensive?""
""Yes,"" said Marilla. ""But Matthew and I will pay for you.""
Six other students from Avonlea wanted to go to Queen's College, too. They studied after school in one class—the Queen's College class.

One evening three weeks later, Anne sat by the window in Green Gables. The sky in the west was slowly turning red.
Suddenly, Diana arrived with a newspaper in her hand.
""Anne!"" she cried excitedly. ""Your name's in the newspaper! You came first in the Queen's College examinations—you and Gilbert Blythe. You're the best students on the island!""

""This is a wonderful place!"" she thought. Then, suddenly, she remembered. She felt very sad again. ""But I can't stay here,"" she thought. ""They don't want me because I'm not a boy.""

'Send him in,' came the reply.

'Good morning, 007,' said M. 'Sit down.' Bond sat in the chair which faced M across the desk. 'Have you ever seen one of these?' M took a gold coin from his pocket and pushed it halfway across the desk towards Bond.

After a time, they stopped outside the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of 5th Avenue and 55th Street. A middle-aged man in a dark blue coat and a black hat came out to meet them.
Halloran said, 'Mr Bond, this is my boss, Captain Dexter. Can I leave him with you now, Captain?' 'Sure,' said Dexter. 'Ask for his bags to be sent up to Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go with Mr Bond and see that he has everything he wants.",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'Who is it?' Bond called.
'Dexter.' Dexter came in, followed by a young man with a black box under his arm. The young man at once went down on his knees beside what was left of the parcel.

'In my job, when I meet a man like Mr Big, I have another saying. It's ""live and let die"".' 'Maybe,' said Dexter. 'But you take my orders while you're here, Mr Bond.' He waved his hand to stop a passing taxi. The yellow car stopped, Dexter got in and then Bond and Leiter watched the car drive away.

His head of yellow hair was now coloured black and he wore a bright blue suit with a white shirt and a black-and-white spotted tie.

585,"Fleming decided to become a writer during the war. He wrote about spies and dangerous criminals. In 1952, he completed his first novel. In the same year, he married Anne Rothermere. He was 44 years old.",james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
586,Bond knocked and walked into M 's office. M was sitting behind a large leather-topped desk. A reading light made a pool of light across the desk. The rest of the room was darkened by the London fog outside the windows.,james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
587,Bond sat in the chair which faced M across the desk. 'Have you ever seen one of these?' M took a gold coin from his pocket and pushed it halfway across the desk towards Bond. Bond picked it up and turned it over in his hand.,james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
589,"If the FBI admits that they know about the coins, the coins will stop coming into the country. They'll be melted down into gold bars and will be lost. They don't want that to happen. Nobody wants it.",james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
593,Bond turned to say goodbye to Halloran. Across 55th Street was a black Chevrolet car. Bond saw it suddenly move out into the busy traffic. The driver was a black woman wearing a chauffeur's uniform.,james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
594,"For a moment, Bond also saw the passenger in the back seat of the car. Just before the car rushed away, the huge grey-black face turned slowly and looked back at Bond through the back window. Was this the face of Mr Big?",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
595,Bond followed Captain Dexter inside the hotel and into the lift. They got out at the twenty-first floor and walked to Room 2100. Dexter unlocked the door. The room was an expensive-looking sitting room.,james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
596,"After moving to America, Mr Big had various different jobs. Then he was forced to join the American armed forces during the Second World War. Because of his excellent French, he worked for the American Secret Service in France.",james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
600,"By the time they left the restaurant, it was ten thirty. Bond and Leiter took a taxi to the Savoy Ballroom, where they had drinks and watched the dancers in the huge, crowded hall.
Bond thought many of the girls were very beautiful and he found the music exciting. He almost forgot what he was there for.
'Great, isn't it?' said Leiter. 'But we'd better move on. I'll have a walk around while you pay for the drinks. I'll see if I can get any information about where Mr Big is. We don't want to have to go to all his places.' They met outside the entrance a few minutes later, then walked up the street looking for a taxi.
'It cost me twenty dollars,' said Leiter, 'but I was told he'll be at The Boneyard on Lennox Avenue soon after midnight.
I'll take you to The Boneyard. I'm sure you'll like her very much, James.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
601,"At twelve forty-five, Bond and Leiter paid their taxi driver and walked into The Boneyard. The head waiter met them and took them to a table in the comer of the club by the small, crowded dance floor.
Bond looked round. It was not a large room, but there were about fifty tables and about two hundred people. The music stopped. The four-man band carried their musical instruments away, and the red light under the glass dance floor was turned off. Instead, pencil-thin lights in the roof came on and shone on coloured glass balls that hung around the walls - yellow, blue and red.
There were calls of 'Where's G-G?' and 'Come on, G -G !' from the crowd.
Suddenly, the MC came out onto the dance floor. A single white light shone down on him as the rest of the room went dark. There was silence.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
602,"Bond was pulled up onto his feet. He had one foot under a leg of the table and he pulled it hard. There was a crash of glass. At the same moment, Leiter kicked backwards behind his chair. His foot hit his guard's leg. Bond did the same, but missed. Then Leiter's guard threw him against the wall so hard that Leiter's nose was almost smashed. When he turned round, blood was pouring out of it.
The man giving the orders spoke to Bond's guard.
'Take him away. Mr Big's waiting.' He turned to Bond.
'Say goodbye to your friend. You probably won't see each other again.' Bond smiled at Leiter.
'See you later,' he said.
Bond's guard turned him round and pushed him against part of the wall. A door opened suddenly, and the man called Tee-Hee pushed past them.
'This way,' he said, and then the door closed behind them.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
603,"Bond was taken through several doors to a large warehouse by his guard and Tee-Hee. They walked across the warehouse floor to a metal door, and Tee-Hee rang a bell. After a moment, the door opened.
A man with a gun stepped back and they went through into a hallway.
'You can go in, Tee-Hee,' said the man with the gun.
Tee-Hee knocked on a door in front of them, opened it and then took Bond into the room. Mr Big sat behind an expensive desk, his huge head resting against the back of his chair. It was a great football of a head, twice the normal size and very nearly round.
There was nothing on the desk except an intercom with about twenty buttons and a very small riding whip. Bond's guard led him across the thick carpet to a low chair. Bond sat down and faced the man across the desk.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
604,"The woman got a chair and sat down near Bond. Her blue eyes looked into his, and they seemed to have some sort of message for him.
The silent message was clear, and a warm smile must have appeared on Bond's face. Suddenly, Mr Big picked up the riding whip from the desk and hit the girl cruelly across her shoulders.
'Sit up!' he said. She sat up slowly.
At no time did she look at Bond, but now he was sure that he had a friend.
'Are you ready, Solitaire?' asked Mr Big.
Bond looked into her eyes and repeated what he had said earlier. Did the woman know that he was not telling the whole truth? If she did, would she speak for him or against him?
For a moment there was silence. She looked at Mr Big. 'He speaks the truth,' she said coldly.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
605,"In his hotel room, Bond poured himself a whisky and then used the telephone. Leiter answered at once.
'Thank God, you're alive!' he said. 'Are you hurt?' 'Broken finger,' said Bond. 'What about you?' 'Nothing serious. Blabbermouth and I got quite friendly. I got him talking about movies and music until instructions came from Mr Big. Then he said ""Sorry, mister,"" knocked me out and took me to Bellevue Hospital. He left me outside. When I came home, I got telephone calls from the police and the FBI. Mr Big had complained that a crazy Englishman had shot three of his men early this morning.
'Mr Big wants the police to do something about it, but I talked to them and the FBI. They're not going to chase after us.
Now, tell me exactly what happened to you.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
606,"Bond told his story.
When he had finished, Leiter said, 'That Solitaire lady certainly seems to be your friend. We need to make plans.
Listen, I'll phone you again in a few minutes. First I'll get the police doctor to come and see you. While you're waiting, you'd better call your boss in London.' Ten minutes later, Bond was speaking to M. He chose his words carefully. He knew that someone might be listening to the conversation. 'It's James, Sir,' he said. 'I may need a bit of help. I went across town to see our main customer last night.
Three of his best men became sick while I was there.' 'Did you get sick?' 'Only a little, Sir,' said Bond. 'But Federated thinks I'll feel better away from town.' Bond smiled. M would know that 'Federated' was the FBI.' Bond put down the telephone and grinned.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
607,"""Bond walked into his bedroom and somehow got out of his clothes. He gave himself a very hot shower and then an ice-cold one. He shaved and managed to pull on a clean shirt and trousers. He put a fresh clip in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through his packing when the telephone rang.
He listened to the zing and echo on the line. He could see the big, grey building near Regent's Park and imagine the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl saying, 'Yes, this is Universal Export,' the address Bond had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for emergency calls on open lines from abroad. She would tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over.""",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
609,"'This is Solitaire. Listen, I've got to be quick. You must trust me. I've got to get away, and so must you. You've got to take me. I can help you - I know a lot of his secrets. But be quick. If he finds out I called you, he'll kill me. Please, you must trust me!' Bond said nothing for a moment. He was thinking fast. Then he said, 'OK, write this down. Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten twenty exactly. The Silver Phantom to ... to Washington. Pullman Car 245, Compartment H. Say that you're Mrs Bryce.
The conductor will have the ticket if I'm not already there. Go straight to the compartment and wait for me.' 'Thank you, thank you!' said Solitaire. 'Now I must go.' Bond put down the telephone. 'That's going to make things interesting,' he said to himself, smiling.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
610,"Bond left the hotel through a back door and got a taxi to Pennsylvania Station. One of Mr Big's spies saw him when he got out of the taxi. The man hurried to a telephone. Some minutes later, a waiter in the train's dining car was replaced by another man. This man had been given full and careful instructions on the telephone.
The Silver Phantom was a long train of silver carriages. It stood quietly in the half-light of the underground station. There were not many passengers. More would get on at Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. Pullman Car 245 was near the back of the train. A porter stood at the door. His black face was bored but friendly.
'Compartment H,' said Bond.
'Mr Bryce?' said the porter. 'Mrs Bryce has just arrived. Go to the end of the carriage.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
611,"Bond stepped onto the train. A notice said: 'If you need anything, ring for your Pullman Porter, Samuel D. Baldwin.' Compartment H was more than halfway down the carriage. There was an American couple in Compartment E, but all the other rooms were empty. The door of Compartment H was locked. Bond knocked.
'Who's that?' asked a woman's voice nervously.
'It's me,' said Bond.
The door opened. Bond walked through and locked the door behind him. Solitaire wore a black suit and her eyes were wide with fear. She looked beautiful.
Bond looked round the room. Then he opened the bathroom door and looked in. It was empty. Moments later, the train began to move. He sat down on a seat with his back to the engine.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
612,"'Mr Big was certain you'd travel to Florida. I heard him warning his people down there about you. He told them to watch the airport at Tampa and the trains. Perhaps we should get off the train earlier, at one of the small stations up the coast. Did they see you get on the train?' 'I don't think so,' said Bond. He was calm again. 'Did you have any trouble getting away?' 'It was my day for a singing lesson,' she said. 'Mr Big wants me to be a singer at The Boneyard. One of his men took me to my teacher and he'll be there to collect me at midday.' She looked at her watch. 'They'll be looking for me in about an hour. I waited until the car had gone, then telephoned you. Next I got a cab and went into the city. All I've got with me is my jewelry and about five thousand dollars of my own money.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
613,"Bond rang for the train attendant and the man started to get their beds ready. He seemed worried about something and he pretended to find it difficult to move around in the small compartment. At last he said, 'Perhaps Mrs Bryce would like to go to the next room while I finish this. It's empty all the way to St Petersburg.' He unlocked the inside door to the next compartment without waiting for an answer.
Bond nodded to Solitaire, and she went through the door. Bond remembered the porter's name and said, 'Is there something you want to tell me, Baldwin?' 'Yes, Sir, Mr Bryce,' said the attendant nervously. 'You've got an enemy on this train.
You need to be careful.' He took two small pieces of wood from his pocket. 'Push these under the doors to stop them opening.'",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
615,"Bond checked the pieces of wood under the doors, then took off his tie and lay down on the bottom bed. He lay thinking about Solitaire and listening to the sound of the train. Soon it was eleven o'clock, and they were travelling between Columbia and Savannah, Georgia. It would be another six hours before they were in Jacksonville.
Mr Big had probably told his man on the train to try to kill Bond during the night, while everyone was asleep and the corridors were empty. Bond read for a while, then turned off his light and thought about Solitaire and the future. He was half asleep when he heard someone trying to unlock the door of their compartment. Bond saw a man running fast towards the end of the carriage, but he could not get his gun out quickly enough to shoot.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
619,"Bond and Solitaire got out of the taxi at a group of small white-and-yellow beach houses called The Everglades.
The two of them went through a door with the word 'Office' on it. The woman behind the desk had blue-grey hair. She smiled.
'Yes?' 'Mr Leiter?' said Bond.
'You're Mr Bryce. Mr Leiter's been waiting for you.' She took them down a path to a cottage and knocked on the door. Leiter opened it. His mouth fell open in surprise when he saw Bond.
'This is my wife,' Bond said quickly.
'Oh - yes, hello,' said Leiter.
He almost pulled the two of them into the cottage, then shut the door before Mrs Stuyvesant could speak.

641,"'Tell me, what more do you know about the gold coins?' asked Bond.
'They definitely get into the USA through St Petersburg,' said Leiter. 'It comes straight from Jamaica and always stops at that factory. What's it called?' 'Ourobouros,' said Bond.
'Let's go and see the place,' said Leiter. ' And let's go and see if we can have a look at Mr Big's robber. Go and tell Solitaire to stay here until we get back, then we'll take her out to dinner.' But Solitaire did not want to be left alone.
'I want to get away from here,' she told him with fear in her eyes.
Bond kissed her.
'It's all right,' he said. 'We'll be back in an hour. Nothing can happen to you here. Then I won't leave you until you're on the plane.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
643,"Bond did not wait. He telephoned for a taxi. He got dressed and was just about to leave to go to the warehouse when the telephone rang. He picked it up.
'Mr Bryce? This is Mound Park Hospital speaking,' said a voice. 'We have a Mr Leiter here who is asking for you.' 'What happened?' asked Bond, full of fear. 'Is he all right?' 'A car accident, but it's not too serious,' said the voice. 'Can you come now?' Bond's taxi arrived and minutes later he was crossing the Treasure Island Causeway.
A nurse sat at the hospital desk. 'Yes?' she said.
'Doctor Roberts called me,' said Bond. 'I'm looking for a patient called Felix Leiter. He was brought in this morning.' 'There's no doctor called Roberts here,' said the nurse.
She looked down at a list on the desk. 'And there's no patient called Leiter.'",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
646,"Bond chose a tank which had a scorpion fish in it. He knew these did not attack, but they were poisonous when touched. He took out a pocket knife and opened the longest blade. He pulled up his shirt sleeve and put his arm into the tank.
He then pushed the knife blade quickly towards the centre of the fish's head. The knife went through it and Bond carefully removed the fish from the tank. He dropped it onto the floor. Next, he put his hand into the sand at the bottom of the tank. His fingers touched rows of coins in a flat tray. He pulled out a coin and shone his torch on it. It was gold, and it was Spanish.
Bond thought for a moment. There had to be a thousand coins in it.
'All very clever,' thought Bond.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
649,"Bond drove towards Tampa and stopped at a bar for a drink. He used the washroom to clean himself. The bandages on his left hand were dirty and his finger was very painful. He was very tired, but he got back into the car and drove towards the airport. He stopped at the first hotel that looked open and awake. It was two o'clock in the morning, and he went straight to bed. He woke up at midday and walked down the road to a cafe for a sandwich and a cup of coffee. Then he went back to his room and wrote a report for the FBI at Tampa. He said nothing in the report about the gold in the poisonous fish tanks - this would be Bond's secret. He did not want Mr Big to know he had seen the coins. Before he got on the plane, he telephoned the hospital. Leiter was no better, but no worse.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
654,"'There have always been stories about Morgan's treasure on the Isle of Surprise,' he explained. 'It's a small island in the centre of Shark Bay, where Morgan used to keep his ships. They say that when he left here for the last time in 1683, he hid his treasure somewhere in Jamaica. When he died, the secret of the treasure's hiding place on the island died with him.
'For two hundred years, treasure hunters found nothing. Then, six months ago, a New York company bought the island. People from this company said that they had come to collect shells and catch tropical fish for the Ourobouros company. One fisherman swam across there at night, planning to search for the treasure. He didn't come back and his body was never found. After that, nobody went near the island again. They were too frightened.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
655,"'It was about that time that I got interested,' Strangways continued. 'I sent a report to London and they discovered that the island belonged to Mr Big. This was about three months ago. I was told to find out what was really happening there, so I arranged for the island to be watched day and night. Nothing suspicious happened, so I got two good swimmers to make an underwater visit to the island. They didn't return, and their bodies appeared in different parts of the bay the next day. Or what the sharks had left of the bodies. Terrible. You can imagine how I felt about it.' 'I've got you a house at Beau Desert. You can see the island from there,' Strangways told Bond. 'I 've got you a car and a good man to work with you. His name's Quarrel and he's the best fisherman and swimmer in the Caribbean.'",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
657,"It was two o'clock in the morning. Bond eased his car away from the sea-wall and moved off through the town on to 4th Street, the highway to Tampa.
Bond stopped at the Gulf Winds Bar and Snacks and ordered a double Old Grandad on the rocks. While the barman poured it he went into the washroom and cleaned himself up. The bandages on his left hand were covered with dirt and the hand throbbed painfully. There was nothing Bond could do about it. His eyes were red with strain and lack of sleep. He went back to the bar. The barman looked like a college kid spending his holidays the hard way. He wanted to talk but there was no talk left in Bond. Bond sat and looked into his glass and thought about Leiter and The Robber.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
658,"They drove back onto the main coast road and stopped for lunch on the other side of the wide bay. Then they drove to the western end of the island to the most beautiful beach Bond had ever seen. There was white sand reaching down to the sea and small fishermen's cottages with palm trees all around them.
This was where they were going to stay for the week before going to Beau Desert. Bond went for a swim while Quarrel went into the cottage and made it comfortable.
Later, when the stars and the moon shone down, the sound of the sea died to a whisper. There was the short silence between the two great winds of Jamaica, then the palm trees began to whisper again.
The next day Bond began his training. Every morning before breakfast, he swam a mile up the beach and then ran back along the sand.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
659,"At about nine o'clock, he and Quarrel would go out in a canoe. The single sail took them fast through the water, up the coast to Bloody Bay and Orange Bay.
Here they pulled the canoe up onto the beach and then went underwater hunting. Bond used a mask and an old harpoon gun.
'Fish don't usually attack a man,' Quarrel told him. 'Except the barracuda - a big, dangerous fish with very sharp teeth.' By the end of the week, Bond could swim two miles without feeling tired. His hand was completely better and he was sunburnt. Quarrel was pleased with him.
In the evening of the eighth day, they came back to the cottage to find Strangways waiting for them. He had good news for them. Felix Leiter had lost an arm and a leg, but he would not die.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2,-1
662,"Leiter was speaking to the FBI on the telephone. Bond went back into Solitaire's room. Her things were still there, and he found her bag under the bed. He looked inside it and found the five thousand dollars.",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
664,"He parked the car near the sea. It was a bright, moonlit night and he walked along by the low sea wall. Bond climbed up the wall and walked on top of it. When he got close to the warehouse, he jumped off the wall.",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

679,When Bond arrived Strangways was there to meet him. He was good-looking and wore a black patch over one eye. The two men spoke very little until they were sitting outside Strangways's attractive white house.,james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
680,"Mr Big is on board. Oh, and a girl called Solitaire is with him. Do you know anything about her?' 'Not much,' Bond said. 'But I'd like to get her away from him. She's not one of his team.' He went outside and looked up at the stars. There was a lot to think about and a lot to do. Discovering the secret of the treasure, killing a dangerous criminal - and rescuing Solitaire.
At six the next morning, Bond and Quarrel left for Beau Desert. They were there by ten thirty. There was a path between the trees that went down to the little beach house. From inside the house, Bond looked across at the island. The top half was hidden by trees, but the cliff looked grey and dangerous in the half shadow made by the hot sun.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
681,"Bond heard the door unlock. The girl came back and slid into the seat opposite him. She looked fresh and gay. She examined him carefully.
'You have been wondering about me,' she said. 'I felt it. Don't worry. There is nothing very bad to know. I will tell you all about it some day. When we have time. Now I want to forget about the past. I will just tell you my real name. It is Simone Latrelle, but you can call me what you like. I am twenty-five. And now I am happy. I like this little room. But I am hungry and sleepy.
Their lunch arrived, brought from the diner by a preoccupied negro waiter. He seemed anxious to be paid and get back to his work.
When they had finished and Bond rang for the Pullman porter, he also seemed distrait and avoided looking at Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
684,"Bond and Strangways walked back up through the trees, leaving Quarrel to watch the yacht. They sat down in the living room. Bond stared out of the window, thinking. The moon was already in the sky, and the wind blew softly through the palm trees. He had travelled two thousand miles for this, but suddenly he hated and feared the sea, and everything in it. And in a few hours, he would walk alone under that black sheet of water. Quarrel came in soon after.
'They're working with lights now, Captain,' he said. 'A tank every five minutes. I guess that'll be ten hours work. They'll finish at about four in the morning, but won't sail before six. It would be too dangerous to leave earlier. It needs to be light for them to find their way through the coral reef.'",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
685,"'I'll start at ten o'clock tonight,' said Bond. 'I'll go from the rocks at the left of the beach. Can you get us some dinner and then get the things I need out onto the beach?' Quarrel left the room, and Bond turned to Strangways.
'Now, tell me what they usually do when they're ready to sail,' he said. 'How long does it take them to get away from the island? If it's the last trip, they'll leave with extra men.' Listening carefully to Strangways, Bond suddenly felt strong again and his fear disappeared. They talked for the next three hours.
At ten o'clock, Bond was on the beach and dressed in his black frogman's suit. Quarrel and Strangways watched him go slowly into the sea and vanish under the water.
'Go safely,' said Quarrel quietly.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
686,"The heavy limpet mine was tied to Bond's chest and carried him straight to the bottom of the sea. He was carrying the harpoon gun in his left hand, but he travelled fast through the water. He was warm in the frogman's suit and breathed easily with the help of the compressed air. It took him fifteen minutes to swim through fifty yards of the dangerously sharp coral reef, which was full of all sorts of sea life. He stopped and rested for a short time at the edge of the reef. Then he swam forwards. There were shadows of big fish on the moonlit sand, some as long as himself. One shadow followed beside him, and he looked up to see a shark. Its nose was following Bond's line of air bubbles. After about a minute, it moved away.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
687,"Then there were large barracudas moving above him and looking down out of their angry eyes. They were interested in him and his bubbles and followed him silently. There were about twenty of them by the time Bond was near the island.
Suddenly, Bond could see the bottom of the boat above him. He looked at his watch. It was three minutes past eleven o'clock. He took a seven-hour fuse from his side pocket and pushed it into the limpet mine. The rest of the fuses he buried in the sand. He did not want them to be found if he was caught. After this, he swam up, carrying the mine between his hands. He fixed it as carefully as he could to the bottom of the boat and turned to swim towards some rocks. Then he saw what was happening behind him.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
688,"The barracudas seemed to be going crazy. They were swimming round in circles like mad dogs, and three sharks were moving quickly between them in the water.
Bond was hit in the face and knocked again and again. At any moment, his rubber suit would be torn and his skin broken and bleeding. Then the barracudas would smell the blood and be attacking him in seconds.He swam fast along the bottom of the boat with his harpoon gun ready. Suddenly, the sea above him turned red. Pieces of something floated down towards him. He caught a piece and looked at it. Up above, someone was throwing dead fish and pouring blood into the water. Mr Big was feeding them. They were his protection against people who wanted to have a look around, three of whom had already been half-eaten by the fish.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
689,"Something hit Bond hard on his left shoulder, and a large barracuda swam away with a piece of black rubber in its mouth. Bond felt no pain as he swam wildly towards the rocks. But blood was coming from his shoulder, and water was starting to come in between the rubber frogman's suit and his skin. He was just about to swim up to the water's surface when he saw a wide hole in the rocks in front of him. A large rock lay on its side next to it, and Bond swam behind the rock. He turned in time to see the barracuda coming towards him again. He fired the harpoon gun and hit the fish in the centre of its open mouth. The fish stopped and tried to close its mouth, then it swam away taking the gun, the line and harpoon with it.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
692,"Mr Big unlocked the door and opened it, and Bond and his guard followed him through into a long narrow room. There were metal shackles low down in the walls.
A light hung down from the roof at the far end. There was someone lying under it, under a blanket.
'Solitaire, said Mr Big softly.
Bond started to move forward, but the guard moved quickly and stopped him. Then Mr Big turned round. He had a small gun in his hand. He pointed it at Bond.
'You can let him go,' Mr Big told Bond's guard. Bond went past Mr Big. Solitaire was on her feet and moving towards him. She saw his face and began to run.
'James!' she cried. 'James!' They held each other.
'Get me some rope,' said Mr Big.
'It's all right, Solitaire,' said Bond, but he knew that everything was not all right. 'I'm here now.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
693,"Solitaire was very pale and there were black circles under her eyes. She wore a dirty white suit and looked thin. She saw the blood on his shoulder and down his arm.
'Oh, my darling, what is it?' she said, and started to cry.
'Tie them up,' said Mr Big. The black guard came towards them with rope in his hands.
For a second or two, Bond thought about attacking him.
'No, Mr Bond,' Mr Big said simply.
The guard tied Bond's arms behind his back.
Over there,' said Mr Big. He pointed at one of the shackles.
The guard knocked Bond's legs from under him, and Bond fell onto his injured shoulder. The guard pulled him across to the shackle, then put the rope through the shackle and down to Bond's legs. He tied them together. Then he walked back to Solitaire and tied her to a shackle opposite Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
694,"Mr Big looked at his watch. 'Go,' he told the guard. He closed the big door behind the man, then turned to Bond.
'Four of my men have died because of you. My people are beginning to question my power, so something must be done. What happened to the American was not enough, so you and the girl can die together.' He looked at his watch again. 'In two-and-a-half hours, at six o'clock, you will be tied together. Then you'll be pulled through the sea behind the yacht when it leaves. The coral reef will cut you into pieces, and the sharks will smell the blood. They'll finish the job for me.' Bond looked at him.
'You're a big man,' he said.. 'And one day you'll die a big and terrible death. If you kill us, that death will come very fast.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
696,"""'Look out!' said Bond as he saw the rope disappearing fast into the water. Bond and Solitaire were suddenly pulled off the jetty and into the sea. For a second, they both went under the water and then they were up again. The water was rushing past them and they were pulled through the waves.
'Breathe, breathe!' shouted Bond. 'Put your legs between mine!' After a time, the boat's speed dropped as the boat moved slowly through the reef. Suddenly, Bond felt the rope tighten again.
It must be after six o'clock now. What had happened to the mine? They were only about thirty yards from the reef now. Now twenty ... ten ...
Suddenly, the breath was knocked from his body. Solitaire and Bond went right up out of the sea before falling back again. The sky lit up with the huge explosion.""",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
697,"Bond felt the heavy rope pulling them under the water. He pushed hard with his legs and they came to the surface. Solitaire's head was on his shoulder and her eyes were shut.
The reef had protected them from the explosion, but now the sea was pulling them towards it. Suddenly, Bond felt the sharp coral against the back of his legs and arms.
There was something sharp under his feet, and he pushed against it. His feet were on the coral and then he felt the pain of a rock pushing into his back.
He rested for a minute. Solitaire was breathing thinly. There was blood in the water around him, but he guessed that the big fish would not come into the sharp reef.
He looked out to sea. The boat was gone, and a great cloud of smoke was blowing towards the land.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2,-1
699,"'You look wonderful,' Bond told Solitaire. They sat for a while, looking out between the trees as the sunlight started to disappear.
There was a crash of broken dishes from the kitchen at the back of the house. Then there was the sound of Quarrel shouting at someone.
'Poor Quarrel,' said Solitaire. 'He's borrowed the best cook in the village and is making us a special dinner. But it's supposed to be a surprise for us.' After they had eaten dinner, Bond told Solitaire about M's message.
'Two weeks' holiday will be wonderful. But I'm badly hurt. I'll also need someone special who can look after me and help me to get better.'
Do you know of anyone?' he asked, and grinned at her.
'Well, I haven't got any other plans for the next two weeks,' she said.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

They were full of the troubles in south-east Europe, and there was a long report about Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister. He seemed to be an honest man, but some people in Europe hated him. However, many people in Britain liked him, and one newspaper said that he was the only man who could prevent a war starting. I remember wondering if I could get a job in south-east Europe; it might be a lot less boring than life in London.
As I walked home that night, I decided to give Britain one more day. I wanted to take part in some adventures. And if nothing interesting happened, I would take the next boat back to Africa.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

I recognized him as the man who lived in a flat on the top floor of the building. We had spoken once or twice on the stairs. 'Can I speak to you?' he asked. 'May I come in for a minute?'
His voice was shaking a little.
I opened the door and we went in.
'Is the door locked?' he asked, and quickly locked it himself.
'I'm very sorry,' he said to me. 'It's very rude of me. But I'm in a dangerous corner and you looked like the kind of man who would understand. If I explain, will you help me?'
'I'll listen to you,' I said. 'That's all I promise.' I was getting worried by this strange man's behaviour.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I'm a little nervous tonight. You see, at this moment I'm dead.'
I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.
'How does it feel?' I asked. I was now almost sure that the man was mad.
He smiled. 'I'm not mad - yet. Listen, I've been watching you, and I guess that you're not easily frightened. I'm going to tell you my story. I need help very badly, and I want to know if you're the right man to ask.'
'Tell me your story,' I said, 'and I'll tell you if I can help you.'

That was very dangerous for me, so I had to disappear. They can't kill Karolides in Greece because he has too many guards. But on the 15th of June he's coming to London for a big meeting, and his enemies plan to kill him here.'
'You can warn him,' I said. 'He'll stay at home. That's what his enemies want. If he doesn't come, they'll win, because he's the only man who understands the whole problem and who can stop the war happening.'
'Why don't you go to the British police?' I said.
'No good. They could bring in five hundred policemen, but they wouldn't stop the murder.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Intermediate,2,-1
726,"I was beginning to like this strange little man. I gave him another whisky and asked him why he thought that he was now in danger himself.
He took a large mouthful of whisky. 'I came to London by a strange route - through Paris, Hamburg, Norway, and Scotland. I changed my name in every country, and when I got to London, I thought I was safe. But yesterday I realized that they're still following me. There's a man watching this building and last night somebody put a card under my door. On it was the name of the man I fear most in the world.
'So I decided I had to die. Then they would stop looking for me. I faked everything. I've left a lot of empty whisky bottles in my room. The police will think I drank too much and then killed myself,' he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
727,"It was the strangest of stories. However, in my experience, the most extraordinary stories are often the true ones. And if the man just wanted to get into my flat and murder me, why didn't he tell a simpler story?
'Right,' I said. 'I'll trust you for tonight. I'll lock you in this room and keep the key. Just one word, Mr Scudder. I believe you're honest, but if you're not, I should warn you that I know how to use a gun.'
'Certainly,' he answered, jumping up. 'I'm afraid I don't know your name, sir, but I would like to thank you. And could I use your bathroom?'

'Listen, Hannay,' he said. 'I think I must tell you some more about this business. I would hate to get killed without leaving someone else to carry on with my plan.'
I didn't listen very carefully. I was interested in Scudder's adventures, but I wasn't very interested in politics. I remember that he said Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, was only in danger in London. He also mentioned a woman called Julia. He talked about a Black Stone and a man who lisped when he spoke. And he described another dangerous man.
The next evening I had to go out. I was meeting a man I had known in Africa for dinner. When I returned to the flat, I was surprised to see that the light in the study was out. I saw something in the corner that made my blood turn cold. There was a long knife through Scudder' heart.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

What story would I tell them about the stranger in my flat? I had lied to Paddock about him, and my story would be hard to believe. They would arrest me for murder, and I had no real friends in England to help me. Perhaps that was part of the plan. An English prison would be a safe place for me until the 15th of June.
Even if the police did believe my story, I would still be helping Scudder's enemies. Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, would stay at home, which was what they wanted. But now I felt responsible for continuing his work.

It was almost full of writing, mostly numbers, although sometimes there was a name. For example, I found the words 'Hofgaard', 'Luneville', and 'Avocado' quite often. The word I saw the most was 'Pavia'.
I was certain that Scudder was using a code. I have always been interested in codes; I enjoy games and numbers and things like that. It seemed to be a number code, where groups of numbers replace letters. I worked on the words, because you can use a word as a key in a number code. I tried for hours, but none of the words helped.

But he didn't look at me, and when I saw myself in a mirror, I understood why; with my brown face and my oId clothes I looked just like all the other hill farmers who were getting into the local train.
I travelled with a group of these farmers. The train travelled slowly through narrow valleys and then up onto an open moor. There were lakes, and in the distance I could see high mountains.
At five o'clock the carriage was empty and I was alone. I got out at the next station, a tiny place in the middle of the moor. A ten-year-old child took my ticket, and I came out of the station onto a white road across the moor.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

After some time I left the road and followed a path along a little stream. I was getting tired when I came to a small house. The woman who lived there was friendly and said I could sleep there. She also gave me an excellent meal.
Her husband came home from the hills later in the evening. We talked about cows and sheep and markets, and I tried to remember some of the information I heard because it might be useful.

I reached the top of a low hill and looked around. To the south, a long way away, I saw something which made me tremble...
Low in the sky a small plane was flying slowly across the moor. I was certain that it was looking for me, and I was also certain that it was not the police. I hid low in the heather and watched it for an hour or two. Finally, it disappeared to the south.
I did not like this spying from the air, and I began to think that an open moor was perhaps not the best place to hide. I could see distant forests in the east, and decided that would be better country.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

He was sitting smoking a pipe, dreamily watching the water, and holding a book. He jumped up as he heard my feet on the road and I saw a friendly young face.
'Good evening to you,' he said in a serious voice. 'It's a fine night to be on the road.'
The smell of cooking came from the house.
'Is that house a hotel?' I asked.
'It certainly is.'
I sat down next to him and got out my pipe. I began to think this young man might help me.
'You're young to own a hotel,' I said.
'My father died a year ago and now it's mine. It's not an exciting job for a young man like me. I didn't choose to do it. I want to write books.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'Not today,' he said. 'Two hundred years ago, there were exciting people on the road, but today there are only cars full of fat old women, and fishermen. You can't make stories out of them. I want to sail up an African river, or live in an Indian village and write about things like that.' The hotel looked peaceful in the evening sun.
'I've travelled a bit,' I said, 'and I'd be happy to live in a peaceful place like this. And perhaps you're sitting next to adventure now.

I'm sure those two men will be back here tomorrow morning for more information about me. Tell the police to be here early.'
At about eight o'clock the next morning I watched three policemen arrive. They hid their car and came into the hotel. Twenty minutes later another car came towards the hotel, but stopped in some trees about two hundred metres away. The two men inside walked up to the hotel.
I had planned to hide in my bedroom and see what happened. But now I had a better idea. I wrote a note to thank the young man for his help, opened my window and dropped out.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

'You've very fine boots.Were they made near here?'
'Oh no, they were made in London. I was given them by a man who was here on holiday last year.'

'I wasn't up very early. And I've seen no bicycles this morning.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
779,"Just before five o'clock an open touring car came up the road,a cigarette, and, by an extraordinary chance, I knew him. His name was Marmaduke Jopley and he was a man I disliked very much. He was only interested in people with money, and in visiting people who lived in beautiful houses in the country. I ran up to the car and took his arm.'Hallo, Jopley.'
His mouth opened wide as he looked at me. 'Who are you?' 'My name's Hannay,' I said. 'You remember me.'
'The murderer!' he cried.
'No, but it doesn't matter. Give me your coat and hat.' He did what I asked. He was very frightened. I put his coat and hat on, and put Mr Turnbull's hat on Jopley's head. I got in the car and started it.
'Now, my friend,' I said, 'you sit quietly and be a good boy. I'm going to borrow your car for an hour or two.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
781,"I woke up very cold in the early morning. I looked down the hill, and in a second I was putting my boots on as fast as I could. There were men only a few hundred metres below me, walking up and searching the heather step by step.
Keeping low in the heather, I moved up the hill. At the top, I stood up and showed myself. I heard men shouting, and then I pretended to disappear over the top of the hill, but in fact, I got down in the heather and crawled back down into the valley. After twenty minutes I looked back and saw the men disappearing over the top of the hill. I didn't know where I was, but I knew I must keep moving. I was twenty minutes in front of them, but they were local men and they knew these hills better than I did. Soon they were close behind me and I was running as fast as I could.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
782,"People were chasing me and I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, I saw a house and as I came nearer the house, I saw an old man looking at me through an open door. I crossed the garden and went in.
I was in a pleasant room, with books everywhere. At a desk in the middle sat an old man with a kind face. He didn't move, but looked up and waited for me to speak.
I was so surprised by his calmness that for a minute I just stared at him.
'You're in a hurry, my friend,' he said slowly. 'The police are after you, are they? Well, we'll talk about it later. I don't like the police in my house when I'm working. Go through that door on the left and close it behind you. You will be safe in there.'
And this extraordinary man picked up his pen and started to write, and I did what he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
785,"Would you be kind enough to tell me what you've been doing for the last few days?'
'I can't. I haven't eaten for two days. Give me something to eat and I'll tell you the truth.' Some food was brought to me, and while I was eating, he said something to me in German. I stared at him stupidly. Then I told him my story. I was a sailor, and I had left my ship in Edinburgh to travel across Scotland to see my brother. I had found a car in a river and taken some money from it. But the police were now chasing me.
'They can have their money back,' I cried. 'It's only brought me trouble!'
'You're good at lying, Hannay,' he said.
I started to get very angry. 'My name's Ainslie and I don't know anybody called Hannay. No, I'm sorry, sir, I'm grateful for the food, but I'd like to go now.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
787,"When I woke up, my head was burning and the sun was shining into my face. I lay for a long time without moving. I could hear men talking about something. I looked through a hole in the wall and saw men with guns. There was the bald man and I thought I could see the fat one too.
For half an hour they searched all the buildings. They came to the door at the bottom of my tower, and for a minute I thought they were going to come up, but the door was locked. All afternoon I lay on that roof. I was terribly thirsty, and, to make it worse, I could see and hear a small stream which came off the moor and flowed near the farm. I wanted a drink of that cool clear water more than anything in the world.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
790,"Mr Turnbull was a good friend. He took care of me for ten days, until my fever had gone and my arm was much better. He went out to work every day, locking the door, and in the evening he sat by the fire. He asked no questions, but on some days he brought me a newspaper, and I saw that the excitement over the Langham Place murder was over.
One day he gave me my money back. 'There's a lot of money there. You'd better count it and see if it's all there.'
I wanted to move as soon as possible, but it was not until the 12th of June that I felt well enough to go. I made Turnbull accept some money for my food, but it was difficult.
I walked the twenty kilometres to the station in a day. I was very happy to be in the train, and on the way south.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
791,"I slept on the train until early morning. Then I changed trains two or three times. At about eight o'clock in the evening I arrived at the small station at Artinswell, to the west of London. The road led through a wood into a green valley. Soon I came to a bridge and looked down into the river, whistling the song 'Annie Laurie'.
A fisherman walked up from the river, and as he got near to me, he started to whistle the same song. He was a big man in old clothes and a wide hat. He smiled at me, and I looked at his kind, intelligent face.
'The water's clear, isn't it?' he said. 'Look at that big fish lying on the bottom. I've been trying to catch him all evening.'
He whistled again, then paused. 'Your name's Twisdon, isn't it?' 'No,' I said. 'I mean yes.' I had forgotten the name I had given Sir Walter.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
792,"I told Sir Walter the whole story, from the night I came home and found my friend murdered. I told him what Scudder had told me about the Greek Prime Minister, and saw him smile once or twice. Then I told him about the murder, and the milkman, and Scotland, and Scudder's notebook.
'You've got it here?' he asked, and looked pleased when I took it from my pocket.
Then I told him about my meeting with Sir Harry, and he laughed. My day as a roadman interested him. He made me describe the two men in the car, and seemed to be thinking hard.
When I described the old man in the farmhouse, he stopped smiling.
'Old, bald, and hoods his eyes like a hawk. I don't like the sound of him. And you blew up his house. You're a brave man.'
Then I reached the end of my story.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
793,"Sir Walter stood up, by the fire, and looked down at me.
'You don't need to worry about the police,' he said.
'They don't want you anymore.'
'Have they arrested the murderer?'
'No. But they know it's not you.'
'How?'
'Because I heard from Scudder. I knew him a bit. He was a strange man, but he was honest. I had a letter from him on the 31st of May.'
'But he'd been dead for a week by then.'
'The letter was written and posted on the 23rd. His letters usually went to Spain and then Newcastle, so they took a week to arrive.'
'What did he say?'
'That he was in danger. He said he was living in Langham Place, and that he was with a good friend. I think he wanted to help you in case he was murdered. When I got the letter, I went to Scotland Yard and talked to the police.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
794,"I came down to breakfast the next morning and found Sir Walter reading a coded message. He seemed less relaxed than yesterday.
'I was very busy for an hour after you went to bed,' he said. 'I've arranged for the Frenchman, Royer, to come a day early. He will be in London at five o'clock. I don't think the change of day will help very much. If our enemies already knew he was coming, they will probably find out that the plans have changed. I would love to know how the news of his visit escaped.'
While I ate, he continued to talk. I was surprised that he was telling me all these important secrets.
After breakfast, he asked me to be his driver for the day.
In London, we went first to Scotland Yard where we met an important-looking policeman.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
796,"I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of Lord Alloa's house. I spoke to one of his servants.
'Is Lord Alloa at home?' I asked.
'Yes, but he's ill and has been in bed all day. Do you want to leave a message, sir?'
I put down the telephone and sat down, shaking. My part in this business was not finished. I walked straight into the room where the others were meeting.
Sir Walter looked surprised and annoyed. 'I'm afraid that this is not a good time, Mr Hannay.'
I think it is,' I answered. 'Tell me, please, who left this room a minute ago.'
'Lord Alloa,' said Sir Waiter, looking angrier.
'It was not,' I cried. 'It looked like him but it was not him.'
'Who. . .' someone asked.
'The Black Stone,' I cried, sitting down, and looking at five frightened men.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
797,"Sir Walter got up and left the room. He came back after ten minutes. 'I've spoken to Alloa. I got him out of bed - he was very angry. He hasn't left his house all day.'
'It's impossible,' said Winstanley. 'I sat next to him for nearly half an hour.'
'That's what's so clever,' I said. 'You were too interested in other things to look at him closely. You knew that he might be well enough to come tonight and, as First Sea Lord, it was natural for him to be here. Why should you suspect that it wasn't him?'
Then the Frenchman spoke, very slowly, and in good English. 'This young man is right. He understands our enemies. People only see what they expect to see. This man came late, spoke little, and left early - but he behaved exactly as we would expect Lord Alloa to behave.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
799,"Suddenly, I had an idea.
'Where is Scudder's book?' I asked Sir Waiter. 'Quick, I remember something in it.'
He gave it to me.
I found the place. 'Thirty-nine steps,' I read, and again, 'Thirty-nine steps -I counted them -high tide, 10.17 p.m.'
'Don't you see it's a clue?' I cried. 'Scudder knew where they were going to leave England. Tomorrow was the day, and it's somewhere where high tide is at 10.17.'
'Perhaps they've already gone tonight,' someone suggested. 'Not them. They have their own secret way, and why should they hurry? They don't know that we're after them.'
Whittaker looked happier. 'It's a chance,' he said. 'Let's go to the Navy Offices.'
Sir Walter went off to Scotland Yard to get MacGillivray. The rest of us drove to the Navy Offices where we went to a big room full of books and maps.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
800,My first idea was to write a letter to the British Prime Minister. But nobody would believe my story. I had to find proof of the whole story.

802,"A hand helped me out of the tree, and a frightened voice asked me if I was badly hurt. The speaker was a young man who was very alarmed and very sorry. I was more pleased than angry; it was a good way for the car to disappear.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
805,"When we arrived at the meeting, there were about five hundred people waiting. I was introduced as a 'trusted Australian leader' and then Sir Harry started to speak. It was mostly about preparing for war.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
806,"He said the Germans didn't want a war and that if we stopped building new warships, the Germans would do the same. I thought about my friend's black book in my pocket. But behind all the rubbish I could see that Sir Harry was a nice man.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
807,"He spoke very badly. I knew I wasn't a good speaker, but I would be better than him. I simply told them everything I knew about Australia. I said that Britain and Australia must work together and be friends.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
808,I sat down at the top of a hill and rested. Behind me was a road climbing out of a river valley. In front were two kilometres of flat open country. To the left and the right were green hills.

812,"A big car stopped and two men got out and walked towards me. I had seen them before - from the window of the hotel. The fatter of the two looked at me with sharp bright eyes. 'Good morning,' he said. 'That's an easy job you've got there.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1
813,"You've very fine boots. Were they made near here?'

820,"Sherlock Holmes became a detective in 1877, four years before I met him. At first he enjoyed every case, but soon he began to find the work easy. Ten years later he was famous, but he was unhappy and bored.
'The modern criminal is so painfully slow and stupid,' he often said. 'I need an interesting case, Watson, one which will make me think. Are there no clever thieves or murderers in the world these days?'
It is dangerous for a very intelligent man like Holmes to become bored. Some days he grew violent and once he shot several bullets into the walls of his room.
One day in 1888 a note arrived from Scotland Yard. When Holmes opened it, he laughed and jumped to his feet.
'Inspector Lestrade wishes to see me,' he said. 'The police need my help, Watson.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
821,"I was sitting alone at home one evening. My wife was away on a visit. Suddenly, the door opened, and Holmes came in. He then ran to the window, closed it and locked it.
'Holmes,' I cried. 'What has happened? You look terrible!'
He looked old and ill, and he was shaking with tiredness.
'What is it?' I asked. 'Are you afraid of something?'
'Of someone,' he said. 'Did you not get my letter?'
'Yes, but I didn't understand it. What is wrong?' Holmes looked at me sadly.
'You didn't understand it. Is your wife here?'
No, she is away. Do you want to sleep here? I shall make sure that you are in no danger.'
He shook his head.
'I cannot rest anywhere. If I sleep, the criminal will win! I cannot stay here. But you can help me, Watson. I must leave the country tomorrow. Will you come with me?'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
822,"Holmes ran out of the house. I followed him quickly and the next two hours passed in a wild chase all over London. We jumped into a cab, out of it again and onto a train, ran down narrow streets and in and out of a big hotel. Finally, we came to rest in the peace of a London park.
'You are a true friend, Watson,' Holmes said at last. 'You came with me without a question. Did you realize that someone was following us?'
'Holmes!'
For a moment I found it difficult to speak.
Then I asked, 'Did you see him through the window? Where was he?'
'In the empty house opposite ours. He was watching our rooms, Watson. He knows that I am looking for him. We must be very careful. He is one of the most dangerous criminals in Europe.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
823,"At the time of this story, I was still living at my friend Sherlock Holmes's flat in Baker Street in London. Very early one morning, a young woman, dressed in black, came to see us. She looked tired and unhappy, and her face was very white.
'I'm afraid! Afraid of death, Mr Holmes!' she cried. 'Please help me! I'm not thirty yet and look at my grey hair! I'm so afraid!'
'Just sit down and tell us your story,' said Holmes kindly.
'My name is Helen Stoner,' she began, 'and I live with my stepfather, Dr Grimesby Roylott, near a village in the country. His family was once very rich, but they had no money when my stepfather was born. So he studied to be a doctor, and went out to India. He met and married my mother there, when my sister Julia and I were very young.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
824,"Dr Grimesby Roylott is a violent man. In India he once got angry with his Indian servant and killed him! He had to go to prison because of that, and then we all came back to England. Our mother died in an accident eight years ago. So my stepfather got all her money, but if Julia or I marry, he must pay us £250 every year.'
'And now you live with him in the country,' said Holmes.
'Yes, but he stays at home and never sees anybody, Mr Holmes!' answered Helen Stoner. 'He's more and more violent now, and sometimes has fights with the people from the village. Everybody's afraid of him now, and they run away when they see him. And they're also afraid of his Indian wild animals which run freely around the garden. A friend sends them to him from India.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
825,"My sister Julia died two years ago, and that's why I'm here. We never met anybody in the country, but sometimes we visited some of my family who live near London. There Julia met a young man who asked to marry her. My stepfather agreed, but soon after this she died.' Miss Stoner put her hand over her eyes and cried for a minute.
Sherlock Holmes was listening with his eyes closed, but now he opened them and looked at Helen Stoner.
'Tell me everything about her death,' he said.
'I can remember it all very well. It was a terrible time!' she answered. 'I couldn't sleep that night. It was a very stormy night. Suddenly I heard a woman's scream. It was my sister's voice. I ran into the corridor, and just then to my sister's door. She opened it and fell to the ground.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
826,"Helen Stoner continued telling her story...
The police couldn't understand why my sister died. Her door was locked and nobody could get into her room. They didn't find any poison in her body. But I think she died because she was so afraid, but I don't know what she was afraid of. Perhaps it was the gipsies.
'That was two years ago,' Helen Stoner said. 'I have been very lonely without my sister, but a month ago a friend asked me to marry him. My stepfather has agreed, and so we're going to marry soon. But two days ago I had to move to my sister's old bedroom, because some men are mending my bedroom wall, and last night I heard that whistle! I ran out of the house immediately and came to London to ask for your help. Please help me, Mr Holmes! I don't want to die like Julia!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
827,"Holmes went out for the morning, but he came back at lunch-time. We then went by train into the country, and took a taxi to Dr Roylott's house. 'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'our dangerous friend Roylott needs the girls' money, because he only has £750 a year from his dead wife. I found that out this morning.
When we arrived, Helen Stoner showed us the three bedrooms. We saw her room first.
'Why are they mending your bedroom wall?' asked Holmes. 'There's nothing wrong with it.'
'You're right,' she said. 'I think it was a plan to move me into my sister's room.'
'Yes,' said Holmes. We went into Julia's room, and Holmes looked at the windows carefully.
'Nobody could come in from outside,' he said.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
828,"Holmes and Watson went into Dr Roylott's room. Holmes saw a large metal box near the wall.
'My stepfather keeps business papers in there,' said Helen.
'Does he keep a cat in there too?' asked Holmes. 'Look!' There was some milk on a plate on top of the box.
'Now, Miss Stoner,' he said, 'I think your life is in danger. Tonight my friend Watson and I must spend the night in your sister's room, where you are sleeping at the moment.'
Helen Stoner and I looked at him in surprise.
'Yes, we must,' he went on. 'We'll take a room in a hotel in the village. When your stepfather goes to bed, put a light in your sister's bedroom window and leave it open. Then go into your old room and we'll get into your sister's room through the window."" Helen Stoner agreed.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
829,"Holmes saw a snake and started shouting.
'The speckled band!'
The band moved and began to turn its head.
'Be careful, Watson! It's an Indian snake and its poison can kill very quickly,' Holmes cried. 'Roylott died immediately. We must put the snake back in its box.'
Very, very carefully, Holmes took the snake and threw it into the metal box.
'But how did you know about the snake, Holmes?' I asked.
'At first, Watson, I thought that it was the gipsies. But then I understood. I thought that perhaps something came through the air-vent, down the bell-rope and onto the bed. Then there was the milk and of course, snakes drink milk. And because he was a doctor, he knew that this snake's poison is difficult to find in a dead body. Perhaps the snake came through the air-vent many times before it killed Julia.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
830,"For Sherlock Holmes, there was only one woman in the world. He did not love her, because he never loved women. But after their meeting he never forgot her. Her name was Irene Adler.
One night in March I visited my old friend at his home in Baker Street. I was married by now, so I did not often see him.
'Come in, Watson,' he said. 'Sit down. I'm happy to see you, because I've got something to show you. What do you think of this? It arrived in the last post.'
It was a letter, with no date, name or address.
It said: 'Tonight someone will visit you, to talk about some very secret business. You have helped other important people, and you can, we hope, help us. Be in your room at 7.45 p.m.'
'Shall I leave, Holmes?' I asked.
'No, no, I need your help. This will be interesting,' my friend answered.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0,-3
831,"There was a knock at the door.
'Come in!' called Holmes.
A tall, strong man came into the room. He was wearing expensive clothes, and a mask over his face. 'You can call me Count von Kramm. I come from Bohemia,' he said. 'My business is most important. Before I tell you about it, do you agree to keep it a secret?'
'I do,' we said together.
'A very important person, who belongs to a royal family, has sent me to ask for your help,' he went on. 'I wear a mask because nobody must know who that person is. I must explain how important this business is. If you cannot help, there will be difficulty and trouble for one of the most important families in Europe — and perhaps a very big scandal. I am talking about the famous House of Ormstein, Kings of Bohemia.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
832,"I am the King. I am Wilhelm von Ormstein, King of Bohemia. I came to see you myself because I could not ask another person to tell my story. It must be a secret. You understand?'
'Very well. Go on,' said Holmes. He closed his eyes and listened.
'Five years ago I met a woman called Irene Adler.
'Ah,' said Holmes, I hear ...' He looked at the King. 'You left her. But before you left her, you wrote her some letters perhaps. And now you want to get these letters back.'
'That's right.'
'Did you marry her?'
'No.'
""Then if she asks you for money and shows you the letters, you can say that you didn't write them.'
'But Mr Holmes, she also has my photograph.'
'You can say that you didn't give her a photograph.' 'We were both in the photograph.'
'Oh dear. That was a mistake, Your Majesty.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
833,"The King continued his story. 'I am going to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You know, of course, that we are two of the most important royal families in Europe. Clotilde will never marry me if she learns that I have been a friend of Irene Adler. You do not know Irene Adler. She's a beautiful woman, but she can be as hard as a man. She was angry when I left her, and so she doesn't want me to marry another woman. We must find the photograph before she sends it!'
'I am sure that we will find it,' said Holmes. 'You are, of course, staying in London? I will write to you to tell you what happens. And, the money . . .?'
The King put a large heavy bag on the table. 'There is one thousand pounds here. If you need more, you must ask at once. The money is not important.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
834,"When I arrived the next day, Holmes was not there, so I waited in his room. At four o'clock the door opened, and a very strange servant came in. He wore old, dirty clothes, and I had to look very hard before I saw that it was my old friend.
'Holmes!' I cried. 'Where have you been?'
'I've had a very good day,' he replied with a smile. 'I've been outside Miss Irene Adler's house. Servants are always happy to talk, and so I have heard a lot about the young woman. For example, she has a good-looking man friend called Godfrey Norton, a lawyer, who often visits her. Now why? If he's her lawyer, perhaps she's already given him the photograph. But if he loves her, she won't show him the photograph.'
'Most interesting, Holmes!' I said.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
835,"While I was near Miss Irene Adler's house, Mr. Norton himself suddenly arrived. I watched them through the windows. When he left, he jumped into a taxi. ""To the church of St Monica, as fast as you can!"" he shouted. Two minutes later Miss Adler ran out of her house, jumped into another taxi and called, ""To the church of St Monica, quickly!"" I couldn't miss this, Watson, so I jumped into a third taxi. When I arrived, I went into the church. Godfrey Norton looked round and saw me.
""Thank God!"" he shouted. ""Come here quickly!"" ""Why?"" I asked. ""Come on, man, we need you!"" And so I helped Godfrey Norton to marry Irene Adler. They needed a witness, and a servant from the street was better than nobody. So she's married him!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
836,"That evening Holmes again wore different clothes, and a large, black hat. But it was not just the clothes that were different. He changed his face, his hair - everything. He was a different man.
We walked together to Serpentine Avenue. Outside the house there were a lot of people who were smoking, laughing and talking. Holmes and I walked up and down in front of the house.
'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'I think Irene Adler doesn't want her new husband to see the photograph. But where is it? At her bank? No. Women like to keep important things themselves. I'm sure it's in her house.'
'But the King's men tried to find it!' I said.
'Yes, but they didn't know where to look!' said Holmes.
'But how will you know?' I asked.
'I won't look. She'll show me. She'll have to.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0,-3
837,"My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, You did it very well. I thought that it was a real fire, and that you were just a kind old man. But after I opened the cupboard, I began to think. I knew about the famous Sherlock Holmes. I knew your address, and I knew that the King asked you to find the photograph. So I quickly dressed as a young man and followed you home to Baker Street. I wanted to find out if you really were Sherlock Holmes. I said 'good night' to you outside your door!
My husband and I have decided to leave England. Please tell the King that I shall not show the photograph to anybody. I love my husband and he loves me. And he is a better man than the King. But here is a different photograph. And the King can keep this photograph, if he likes.
Very truly yours,Irene Norton, née Adler.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
838,"In September 1887 my wife was visiting some of her family, so I was staying with my old friend Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street. It was a windy, stormy evening, and the rain was falling heavily outside. Suddenly there was a knock at the door.
I looked at my friend in surprise. 'Who can this be?' I asked.
'If he comes on business in this weather, it's important,' said Sherlock Holmes. 'Come in!' he called.
A young man came in. He looked wet, tired and worried. 'I've come to ask for help,' he said. 'I've heard of you, Mr Holmes. People say you know everything. I don't know what to do.'
'Well, sit down,' said Holmes, 'and tell me about yourself.'
The young man sat down, put his wet feet near the fire and started telling his story.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
839,"My name is John Openshaw. My father, Joseph, had a brother, my uncle Elias, who went to live in America when he was young. He made a lot of money there. He fought against the men from the North during the Civil War. But when the South lost the war, Uncle Elias left America. So in 1869 he came back to England and went to live in a large house in the country. He was a strange, unhappy man.
'He did not want any friends,' John Openshaw went on, 'and he often drank a lot. But he liked me, and when I was twelve, I moved to Uncle Elias's house. He was very kind to me. I could go anywhere in the house. But there was one small room at the top of the house which was always locked. Nobody could go into this room. That was one of the most strange things.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
840,"One day Uncle Elias got a letter from Pondicherry in India. ""I don't know anyone in Pondicherry!"" he said, but when he opened the envelope, five little orange pips fell on to his plate. I began to laugh but stopped when I saw my uncle's white face.
""K.K.K.!"" he cried. ""Oh my God, they've found me!""
""What do you mean, uncle?"" I asked.
""Death!"" he cried, and ran upstairs.
'Uncle Elias went immediately to the secret room and took out a box which also had three Ks on it. He burnt all the papers in the box, and said to me, ""John, I know that I'm going to die soon. My brother, your father, will have all my money and my house after my death, and you will have it all when he dies. I hope you can enjoy it, but if not, give it to your worst enemy. I'm afraid that my money brings death with it.""",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
841,"Openshaw continued his story. 'I didn't understand what my uncle was talking about, and nothing happened for a few weeks, so I did not feel so worried. But my uncle was very afraid. He stayed in his room most of the time, and drank more than before. He always locked all the doors carefully. Then one night he drank very heavily and ran wildly out of the house, and in the morning we found him dead in a river. The police said he killed himself, but I knew he was afraid to die, so I didn't think that was true.'
'After my uncle's death, my father moved into the house. Of course I asked him to look carefully at the locked room, but we didn't find anything important.' 'Everything went well until a year later,' said John Openshaw. 'But one morning my father opened a letter to find five orange pips inside it...'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
842,"Openshaw kept telling his story. 'One day my poor father went to visit an old friend who lived some miles away. But he never came back. The police said that he was walking home in the dark when he fell down a hill. He was badly hurt, and he died soon after. They decided it was an accident, but I didn't agree. I thought it was murder, and I could not forget the five orange pips and the strange letters to my uncle and my father.
'But I've tried to forget, and I've lived alone in that house for nearly three years now. Then yesterday I got this.'
The young man showed us an envelope with K.K.K. on the back, and five small orange pips.
'You see?' he said. 'It comes from East London, and it says ""Put the papers in the garden"". Those are the words that were in the letter to my father.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
843,"Sherlock Holmes sat silently, and watched the fire. Then he said to me, 'John Openshaw is in real danger. Why did his Uncle Elias have to leave America? Because he had enemies. When he came back to England he was afraid. That's why he lived a lonely life and locked all his doors so carefully. Now where did those letters come from?
'The first from Pondicherry in India, the second from Dundee in Scotland and the third from East London.'
'Does that tell you anything?' asked Holmes.
'They're all sea ports. The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,' I replied. 'Somebody sent some pips from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill Uncle Elias, then it was John's father. Do you see why I'm worried now? He has sent pips to John from Londonl John's enemy is in London already!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
844,"Holmes explained evething to me, 'Killers belong to the Ku Klux Klan. That why they used the ""K.K.K."". Haven't you ever heard of it? It's a very secret group of Americans from the South. They wanted to stop equality for black people and to kill anyone who didn't agree with them. The police couldn't stop them. But in 1869 Uncle Elias, who belonged to this secret group, suddenly left America with all their papers, and so the group could not go on. Of course the group wanted to get the papers back. You remember the half-burnt paper? That was Uncle Elias's American diary. While he was working for the K.K.K., he sent the pips to frighten those three men. Two left the country, but one didn't, so the K.K.K. ""finished business with him"", or killed him. The K.K.K. always worked like that.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
845,"The next morning we read in the newspaper that John Openshaw was dead. A policeman found him in the river near Waterloo station. The police said it was an accident, but Holmes was very angry about it.
'He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!' he said to me, and he hurried out of the house.
In the evening, when he came back to Baker Street, he was tired, but pleased. 'Watson!' he said, 'I know the names of Openshaw's enemies! And now I'm going to send them a surprise! This will frighten them!' He took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope. On it he wrote 'S.H. for J.C.'
'I'm sending the pips, not from the K.K.K., but from me, Sherlock Holmes, to Captain James Calhoun.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
846,"One day, in the autumn of 1890,I decided to visit Sherlock Holmes.
But when I arrived at his apartment, I found he already had a visitor.
This visitor was an old man. He was fat, with a red face. But the most unusual thing about him was his hair. The colour of the old man's hair was bright red.
'I'm sorry, Holmes,' I said. 'I didn't know you were busy. I'll wait in the next room.'
But Holmes didn't want me to leave. He pulled me into the room and closed the door.
'This is my friend, Dr Watson,' he said to the old man. 'Dr Watson has helped me with many cases. Perhaps he can also help me with yours.'
This is Mr Jabez Wilson,' went on Holmes.
'Mr Wilson, could you please tell your story again from the beginning. I'd like Dr Watson to hear it.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
847,"Mr Wilson started his story.
'I have a small shop in Saxe-Coburg Square, in the City of London. But business hasn't been good for some time and I don't make much money any more. I used to have two assistants, but now I only pay one, and he's willing to work for half-pay.'
'That's very unusual,' said Holmes. 'What's the name of your assistant?'
'Spaulding. He is very interested in photography and takes a lot of photographs. He develops these photographs himself, in the cellar of my shop. When he isn't working, he spends all his time down there.'
'One day, eight weeks ago, Spaulding came to me with a newspaper in his hand. It was the same newspaper that I showed you, Dr Watson and told me about the Red-headed League. He also said that I could become a member and make a lot of money.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
848,"At quarter past nine that evening, I set off for Baker Street, where Holmes lived. When I arrived, I noticed two carriages standing outside Holmes' door.
Inside his apartment, Holmes was talking with two men. One of them was Peter Jones, a police detective. The other man was tall and thin, with a sad-looking face.
'Hello, Watson,' said Holmes. 'I think you already know Mr Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce Mr Merryweather. Mr Merryweather is also coming with us tonight.'
'I hope it's important,' said Mr Merryweather sadly. 'I usually play cards with friends on Saturday evenings. I have played cards every Saturday night for the last twenty-seven years.'
'I think,' said Sherlock Holmes, 'that tonight you'll play a more exciting game than cards. We may catch a famous criminal.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
849,"It's time to go now,' said Holmes. 'Two carriages are waiting. You two take the first carriage and Watson and I will follow in the second.'
The carriages went quickly through the dark streets. I wondered where we were going.
'We're nearly there,' Holmes said to me, at last. 'This man, Merryweather, is a bank manager. I wanted Jones to come with us, too. He's a good man. He's not very clever, but he is very brave. Ah, here we are.'
We were in the same busy street which Holmes and I had visited earlier in the day. We got out of the carriages and Mr Merryweather took us down to a small side door of the bank.
Then he took us down some steps and through the gate. At last, we were in a large cellar with boxes full of gold.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
850,"Sherlock Holmes became a detective in 1877, four years before I met him. At first he enjoyed every case, but soon he began to find the work easy. Ten years later he was famous, but he was unhappy and bored.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
851,It is dangerous for a very intelligent man like Holmes to become bored. Some days he grew violent and once he shot several bullets into the walls of his room. One day in 1888 a note arrived from Scotland Yard.,the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1
852,"Holmes ran out of the house. I followed him quickly and the next two hours passed in a wild chase all over London. We jumped into a cab, out of it again and onto a train, ran down narrow streets and in and out of a big hotel.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Sir Walter was fifty-four years old and was a handsome man. But he was not a clever man. He only thought about his hair and his moustache, or the colour of his coat or shirt or trousers.

Anne was a pretty, but very quiet young woman. She was the cleverest of the three girls. She liked thinking; she liked talking to other people; she liked reading good books. But her father loved Elizabeth and Mary more than he loved Anne. He wasn't interested in her. Sir Walter, their father, never wanted to think about money. He liked buying new things for the house.

They were very happy together, but only for a short time. Captain Wentworth spoke to Sir Walter one day.
'Your daughter, Anne, and I are in love, sir,' he said. 'We are very happy together. I am here to ask you, Sir Walter, for your daughter's hand. We want to marry.'

She wanted Anne to wait and find a richer, more important man to marry, not a young officer in the navy. Anne listened carefully to Lady Russell. The older woman's persuasion slowly began to work. Slowly, Anne started to think her love for Captain Wentworth was wrong.
'Perhaps I am too young,' she thought. 'And perhaps I cannot help Frederick to be happy. I must think of his work in the navy - perhaps he can do better without me.'

Uppercross was a beautiful old English village, about three miles from Kellynch Hall. Charles and Mary lived in a small house, Uppercross Cottage.

He spoke to her and then turned quickly away and spoke to one of his friends, but he was not cold and he was not friendly to her. After a minute or two, he turned to her again.
'You are going home, I see, Miss Elliot, but it is raining and you have no coat. Can I help you to find a carriage? You cannot walk home in the rain.'

'How do you do?' she asked when he saw her. He stopped and they talked for a minute or two about the weather in Bath and about the Crofts. Then they had nothing more to say, but he did not leave her. Suddenly, he started to speak again - about Louisa's accident and her love for Captain Benwick. 'He wants me to understand that he was not in love with Louisa at Uppercross and in Lyme,' she thought.

'Yes. You are right. We must leave Kellynch Hall and find a smaller house to live in. Perhaps we can look for a house in Bath. A lot of interesting, rich families live in Bath!'
Anne listened. She was not happy. She did not like Bath she remembered her three unhappy years at school there, after her mother died. But they didn't ask Anne. Sir Walter was not interested in Anne.

'Was that Grace Poole?' I said to myself. 'Yes, it was Grace. Why was she laughing? And why is she walking in the house at night? Is she mad? I must tell Mrs Fairfax about this.'
I put on some clothes and opened the door. There was a candle on the floor outside my room. The candle was burning. There was thick smoke in the corridor. I looked around.

But except for African animal parks, there are not many places left in the world where lions still run free. Today the only wild lions outside Africa are a few hundred protected in the Gir Forest National Park of northwestern India. Each pride is made up of lionesses of different ages, all of which are related, plus their cubs and one or two adult male lions. During the day lions lie in the shade or climb trees and rest on the branches. But lions become very active at night. Like other cats, they can see well in dim light and like to hunt in the dark.

If you found this animal in your bedroom, you might think it was a toy teddy bear. But this is a real animal (though it isn't a real bear) called the koala. It is found only in Australia. The koala drinks dew and eats nothing but leaves of the eucalyptus tree. It is famously slow-moving and gentle, and it sleeps up to 16 hours a day. Even when they're being aggressive, koalas rarely use their energy to fight. Instead, they'll make loud croaking sounds known as ""bellowing."" Koalas are related to kangaroos. Koalas carry and nurse their young in a pouch on their bellies. It's like a built-in baby basket.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

That is why people use them for crossing deserts. Camels don't have to stop all the time for a drink or a bite to eat. When camels do get hungry, they're definitely not hard to feed. Camels eat all kinds of grass and plants, even those that are dry and thorny. In fact, a hungry camel will gobble up tents, straw baskets, and even leather belts and will drink 25 gallons of water in just a few minutes! Here's an oddity: camels have a double set of eyelashes. These help to keep the camel's eyes safe from sand during desert storms.

They live on the high Himalayan mountain plateaus of Tibet (part of China), Nepal, and Bhutan. Yaks graze on grass and need a lot of water, often eating snow in winter. Some yaks live in the wild. But their numbers have decreased so much that soon none may be left. Bulls (male yaks) in the wild can grow as tall as six feet and may weigh twice as much as a horse. Cows (female yaks) are usually smaller and weigh less. Wild yaks live in large herds of cows, young bulls, and calves. Older bulls stay together in smaller groups.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Millions of years ago, the island of Madagascar broke away from the continent of Africa. On the continent the monkeys were smarter than the lemurs, and the lemurs all died out. Lemurs are mild, shy animals, but they can be very curious if there's food around. They have a better sense of smell than monkeys do, and they use it to find fruits, leaves, insects, and small birds to eat. Most of this activity takes place at night, since lemurs like to sleep during the day. Lemurs usually have only one baby at a time. The baby clings to its mother's underside and travels with her through the treetops.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Some jellyfish are clear, but others can be pink, yellow, blue or purple. Jellyfish have no brain, heart, bones or eyes. They are made up of a smooth, bag-like body and tentacles armed with tiny, stinging cells. Jellyfish stings can be painful to humans and, from certain species, they can even be deadly. Jellyfish eat fish, shrimp, crabs and tiny plants. The jellyfish itself provides a tasty meal for other ocean creatures, particularly sea turtles. In some cultures around the world, people eat jellyfish, too. In China, they are considered a delicacy, and are also used in Chinese medicine.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Scientists have found that some insects have also become accustomed to a day and night routine, only hunting for prey or visiting flowers during daylight hours. But it's not just the way they nap that makes insects similar to us – they also feel the strain of getting too little sleep. Bugs suffer from memory problems when they don't hit the hay, leading to decreased concentration and communication problems. As a result, they can become confused. While humans need around eight hours' kip a night, the exact amount of time insects require is still not known.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Rainforests have their own perfect system for ensuring their own survival; the tall trees make a canopy of branches and leaves which protect themselves, smaller plants, and the forest animals from heavy rain, intense dry heat from the sun and strong winds.
Amazingly, the trees grow in such a way that their leaves and branches, although close together, never actually touch those of another tree. Scientists think this is a deliberate tactic to prevent the spread of any tree diseases and make life more difficult for leaf-eating insects like caterpillars. To survive in the forest, animals must climb, jump, fly or glide across the gaps.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Bats live all over the world, but they prefer warm climates. They like to live in huge groups, or colonies, sometimes with 1,000 bats or more in a colony. Bats sleep in caves, the hollows of trees, and empty buildings. There are many kinds of bats, in many sizes. The flying fox bat, when it stretches its wings, is wider than you are tall. But the tiny Philippine bamboo bat's wings are barely six inches from tip to tip. Most bats eat insects. The Mexican bats of Texas can eat up millions and millions of insects every year! Other bats eat fruits, honey, and pollen. But whatever they eat, all bats look for their food at night.",wildlife wonders,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

Ostriches can run up to 40 miles an hour. This makes them not just the biggest but also the fastest birds on the ground! Ostriches don't use their speed to catch food. Instead, they run to keep away from their enemies. But the first thing ostriches do when they see an enemy is hide. To avoid being seen, ostriches generally lie flat on the ground with their necks outstretched. This makes them look like just another bush. People sometimes say that ostriches bury their heads in the sand when they sense danger. But this isn't true. You just can't see their heads when ostriches are lying down.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2,-1

The scientists began by tossing food on three different floor surfaces - tile, laminate or wood, and carpet. The study found that when food comes in contact with bacteria, the transfer is immediate. Also, the transfer is much larger when the food is dropped on tile, wood or laminate as opposed to carpet.

It began in a house in Pudding Lane, near London Bridge. More than a quarter of a million Londoners lost their homes in the fire. It destroyed St Paul's Cathedral and eighty-eight other churches. But the fire also destroyed most of the worst old buildings and the new houses that went up after this were better for people to live in. A new St Paul's Cathedral was built between 1675 and 1711.

Even Antarctica has one, a frigid desert. Most deserts, however, are arid, or dry, deserts with mile after mile of sand, baked earth, and barren rock. In the daytime these places look like lost worlds—hot, dry, and silent. Usually, the only plants growing there are low thorny ones. These plants store most of the water they are able to collect.

As more and more rock wears away, the opening grows wider and deeper. In time, many of these openings become huge caves, or caverns. Some caves have beautiful craggy formations called ""stalactites,"" like those pictured here, that hang from the cave's roof. These are made by water seeping into the cave.

'Nobody's watching me,' he thought.
He took more meat from the big plate in front of him, and put it under the small plate. Then he pushed down hard with his hand.
The waiter walked past his table again. Mr. Bean smiled at him and put his arm on the plate. After the waiter went away, he pushed down on the small plate again.
'That's better,' he thought. 'Now you can't see the meat. But there's more meat. Where can I hide it?'
'The sugar pot!' he thought. 'But it's got sugar in it.'
He thought quickly, then he put some sugar into a wine glass. Next, he put some of the meat into the sugar pot. Then he put the sugar from the wine glass on top of it.

The man with the violin walked round Mr. Bean's table and watched him. He played his violin and waited for Mr. Bean to eat the meat.
'I'll have to eat some,' thought Mr. Bean. 'He'll only go away when I eat it.'
So he put the meat into his mouth.
And the man with the violin turned away to the next table.
The meat was in Mr. Bean's mouth, but he didn't want to eat it. He wanted to put it somewhere. But where? He looked at the man with the violin. The man didn't see what Mr Bean was doing. He hid the meat under a big napkin.

1350,"Before I begin my story, I would like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York in the north of England. My father was German, but he came to live and work in England. Soon after that, he married my mother, who was English. Her family name was Robinson, so, when I was born, they called me Robinson, after her. My father wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet, comfortable life. But I didn't want that. I wanted adventure and an exciting life.
'I want to be a sailor and go to sea,' I told my mother and father.
They were very unhappy about this. About a year later, I saw a friend in town. His father had a ship and so, on September 1st, 1651, I went to Hull, and the next day we sailed for London.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1351,"For two long years I was a slave. I worked in the house and the garden, and every day I planned to escape, but it was impossible. I thought about it day and night. My master liked to go fishing in a little boat, and he always took me with him. A man, called Moely, and a young boy also went with us.
One day my master said to us, 'Some of my friends want to go fishing tomorrow. Get the boat ready.'
So we put a lot of food and drink on the boat, and the next morning, we waited for my master and his friends. But when my master arrived, he was alone.
'My friends don't want to go fishing today,' he said to me. 'But you'll go and catch some fish for our supper tonight.'
'Yes, master,' I answered quietly, but inside I was excited. 'Perhaps now I can escape,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1352,"That day I was lucky, and the sea carried me to the shore. I could not see the land, only mountains of water all around me.
Then, suddenly, I felt the ground under my feet. Another mountain of water came, pushed me up the beach, and I fell on the wet sand. At first I was very thankful to be alive. Slowly, I got to my feet and went higher up the shore. From there, I looked out to sea. I could see our ship, but it was wrecked and there was nobody near it.
There was nobody in the water. All my friends were dead. I was alive, but in a strange wild country, with no food, no water, and no gun. It was dark now and I was tired. I was afraid to sleep on the shore. Perhaps there were wild animals there. So I went up into a tree and I stayed there all night.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1353,"I looked around the ship, and after a few minutes, I found some long pieces of wood. I wanted to bring them to the shore. So I tied them together with rope. Then I got the things that I wanted from the ship. There was a big box of food - rice, and salted meat, and hard ship's bread. I also took many strong knives and other tools - the ship's sails and ropes, paper, pens, books, and seven guns. Now I needed a little sail from the ship, and then I was ready. Slowly and carefully, I went back to the shore. It was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea, but in the end I got everything on to the shore.
Now I needed somewhere to keep my things. There were some hills around me, so I decided to build myself a little house on one of them.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1354,"The next day I thought about the possible dangers on the island. Were there wild animals, and perhaps wild people too, on my island? I didn't know, but I was very afraid. So I decided to build a very strong fence. I cut down young trees and put them in the ground, in a half-circle around the front of my tent. I used many of the ship's ropes too, and in the end my fence was as strong as stone wall. Nobody could get over it, through it, or round it.
Making tents and building fences is hard work. I needed many tools for it. So I decided to go back to the ship again, and get some more things.
I went back twelve times, but soon after my twelfth visit there was another terrible storm. The next morning, when I looked out to sea, there was no ship.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1355,"I still needed a lot of things.
'Well,' I said, 'I'm going to have to make them.'
So, every day, I worked. First of all, I wanted to make my cave bigger. I carried out stone from the cave, and after many days' hard work I had a large cave in the side of the hill. Then I needed a table and a chair, and that was my next job. I had to work on them for a long time. I also wanted to make laces to put all my food, and all my tools and guns. But every time I wanted a piece of wood, I had to cut down a tree. It was long, slow, difficult work, and during the next months I learnt to be very clever with my tools. There was no hurry. I had all the time in the world. I also went out every day, and I always had my gun with me. Sometimes I killed a wild animal, and then I had meat to eat.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1356,"I was on the island for ten months before I visited other parts of it. During those months I worked hard on my cave and my house and my fence. Now I was ready to find out more about the rest of the island.
First, I walked along the side of a little river. There, I found open ground without trees. Later, I came to more trees with many different fruits. That night I went to sleep in a tree for the second time, and the next day I went on with my journey. Soon I came to an opening in the hills. In front of me, everything was green, and there were flowers everywhere.
There were also a lot of different birds and animals. I saw that my house was on the worst side of the island. But I didn't want to move from there. I stayed away for three days, and then I came home.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1357,"And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. The roof of my cave fell in, and nearly killed me! I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.
I had a lot of food now. I cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun. So I always had meat during the rainy months when I could not go out with a gun.
I learnt to make pots to keep my food in. I wanted very much to make a harder, stronger pot - a pot that would not break in a fire. I tried many times, but I could not do it.
Then one day I was lucky. I made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire.
They changed colour, but did not break.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1358,"By then, I also had my own bread. That was luck, too. One day I found a little bag. We used it on the ship, to keep the chickens' food in. There was still some of the food in the bag, and I dropped some of it onto the ground.
A month later, I saw something bright green. And after six months I had a very small field of corn. I was very happy and excited. Perhaps now I could make my own bread!
It was easy to say, but not so easy to do. It is a lot of work to make bread from corn. Many people eat and enjoy bread, but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help? I had to learn and to make many new things, and it was a year before I cooked and ate my first bread.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2
1359,"During all this time I never stopped thinking about escape. When I travelled across to the other side of the island, I could see the other islands, and I said to myself, 'Perhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day.'
So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe.
Next, I had to get it down to the sea. How stupid I was! Why didn't I think before I began work? Of course, the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it! I pulled and pushed and tried everything, but it didn't move. I was very unhappy for a long time after that. That happened in my fourth year on the island.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1360,"In my sixth year I made myself a smaller canoe, but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey, and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now, not my prison, and I was just happy to be alive. A year or two later, I made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island. I also built myself a second house there, and so I had two homes.
My life was still busy from morning to night. There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. I kept food and tools at both my houses, and also wild goats. There were many goats on the island, and I made fields with high fences to keep them in. They learnt to take food from me, and soon I had goat's milk to drink every day.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1361,"Then, one year, something strange and terrible happened.
I often walked along the shore, and one day I saw something in the sand. I went over to look at it more carefully, and stopped in a sudden surprise.
It was a footprint - the footprint of a man! Afraid, I looked around me. I listened. I waited. Nothing. I was more and more afraid. Perhaps this man was one of those wild people who killed and ate the men! I looked everywhere, but there was nobody, and no other footprint. I turned and hurried home.
'There's someone on my island,' I said to myself.
That night I couldn't sleep. The next day I got all my guns ready and I put more wood and young trees around my house. Nobody could see me now. But, after fifteen years on the island, I was afraid, and I did not leave my cave for three days.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1362,"In the end, I had to go out to milk my goats. But for two years I was afraid. I stayed near my home and I never used my guns because I didn't want to make a noise. I could not forget the footprint, but I saw and heard nothing more, and slowly I began to feel happier.
One day, a year later, I was over on the west side of the island. From there I could see the other islands, and I could also see a boat, far out to sea. 'If you have a boat,' I thought, 'it's easy to sail across to this island. Perhaps that explains the footprint - it was a visitor from one of the other islands.'
I began to move more freely around the island again, and built myself a third house. It was a very secret place in a cave.
'No wild man will ever find that,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1363,"For two years I never went anywhere without my gun. I felt lonely and afraid, and had many sleepless nights.
One night there was a very bad storm, and I thought I heard the sound of guns out at sea.
The next morning I looked out, and saw a ship. It was lying on its side not far from the shore. Quickly, I put my little boat in the water and sailed out to it.
There were two dead men on the ship, but no one alive. The bodies of the other sailors were lost in the sea.
In the morning I woke up and made a plan. 'I'll try to catch one of the prisoners of the wild men,' I said to myself.
He'll be happy to be alive and perhaps he'll help me to escape.'
I watched day and night, but for a year and a half there were no boats.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1365,"I called to him and tried to show him that I was friendly. Slowly, he moved nearer to me, but just then the first wild man began to get up from the ground. Then the prisoner spoke and I understood that he wanted my sword. How happy I was to hear words again! I gave him my sword, and at once he cut off the head of his enemy. Hurriedly, we hid the dead bodies under some leaves, and then left quickly. I took my prisoner to my secret cave on the other side of the island and gave him food and drink. After that, he went to sleep.
He was a fine young man, about twenty-five years old, well-built, with a kind face and a nice smile. He had brown skin, black hair, bright eyes and strong white teeth. I decided to give him the name of 'Man Friday', because I first saw him on a Friday.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1366,"When we got to my house, 1 gave Man Friday some trousers, and I made him a coat and a hat. He liked his new clothes very much. Then I made him a little tent to sleep in, but for a few weeks I always took my gun to bed with me. Perhaps Friday was still a wild man and would try to kill me in the night. At first, Friday was very afraid of my gun. Sometimes he talked to it, and asked it not to kill him.
Friday was a quick learner and his English got better day by day. He helped me with the goats and with the work in the cornfields, and soon we were good friends. I enjoyed teaching him and, most of all, having a friend to talk to. This was the happiest of all my years on the island. Friday and I lived together happily for three years.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1367,"I told Friday the story of my adventures and about life in England, and he told me about his country and his people. One day we were at the top of the highest hill on the island, and we were looking out to sea. It was a very clear day and we could see a long way. Suddenly, Friday began to jump up and down, very excited.
'What's the matter?' I said.
'Look, Master, look!' Friday cried. 'I can see my country. Look over there!'
I looked, and there to the north-west, between the sea and the sky, was a long thin piece of land. I learnt later that it was the island of Trinidad, and that my island was in the mouth of the River Orinoco on the north coast of South America.
I began to think again about escape. Perhaps Friday wanted to go home too. Perhaps together we could get to his country.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1368,"I took Friday to the other side of the island and showed him my big canoe. It still lay under the trees. It was very old now, and there were holes in the wood.
'Could a boat like this sail to your country, Friday?' I asked him.
'Oh yes,' he answered. 'A boat like this can carry a lot of food and drink.'
'Then we'll make another canoe like it, and you can go home in it,' I said.
But Friday looked very unhappy.
'Why are you angry with me?' he asked. 'What have I done? Why do you want to send me home?'
'But I thought you wanted to go home,' I said.
'Yes. But you must come with me.'
Then I saw that Friday was a true friend, and so I agreed to go with him. We began work on the canoe at once. We worked hard and in a month the boat was finished.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0,-2
1369,"I was now in my twenty-seventh year on the island, and I did not want to be there for another year. We worked hard to get the corn in, and to make a lot of bread. We had dried fruit and salted meat, and big pots to keep water in. One evening Friday went out to look for a turtle for meat and eggs. But in less than an hour he was back, and he looked very afraid.
'Master! Master!' he cried. 'There's a great ship near the island, and men are coming to the shore in a boat!'
I jumped up and ran with him down to the shore. To my great surprise, I saw that it was an English ship! But why was it here? English ships never came this way. Perhaps they were pirates!
'Don't let them see you, Friday!' I called. 'We'll hide in the trees and watch.'",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1370,"When I came back to England, I felt like a stranger in the country. Many things were different, and not many people remembered me. I went home to Yark, but my father and mother were dead, and also my two brothers. I did find the two sons of one of my brothers. They were happy to learn that I was alive, and I was pleased to find some family.
After some months I decided to go down to Lisbon in Portugal. I had friends there who could help me to sell my land in Brazil, and I needed the money. Friday came with me. He was always a good and true friend to me.
In Lisbon I found the Portuguese captain, who took me in his ship to Brazil, all those years ago. It was good to see him again, and he helped me with my business. Soon I was ready to go home again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1371,"It was a long hard fight, but by now it was dark and this helped us very much. We ran here and there in the trees, calling and shouting. The seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting.
In the end the first officer shouted to them: 'Put down your guns and stop fighting! The captain has fifty island people to help him. We can kill you all!'
So the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns. Three of the men agreed to come back to the captain, and we put the others in my cave. Friday and I stayed to watch the prisoners, while the captain and his men went back to fight for the ship. All night we listened to the sound of guns and shouting, but in the morning, when the sun came up, the captain was master of his ship again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1372,"Friday and I went down to the shore to meet the captain.
'My dear friend,' he cried. 'There's your ship! I'll take you to the end of the world in it!'
I put my arms round him, and we laughed and cried together. How happy I was to leave the island!
My good friend Friday came with me, of course, but we left the mutineers on the island. We decided not to kill them; they could begin a new life on the island. I showed them my three houses, my cornfields and my goats, and all my tools. Their life would be easy because of all my hard work for so many years.
And so, on the nineteenth of December 1686 - after twenty-seven years, two months and nineteen days - I said goodbye to my island and sailed home to England.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1373,"Our journey back to England was long and hard. We had to cross the mountains between Spain and France in winter, and the snow was deep. Poor Friday was very afraid of the snow.
In his country it was always hot, and he did not like cold weather.
Back in England I found a house and began to live a quiet life. My two nephews came to live with me. The younger one wanted to be a sailor, and so I found him a place on a ship. After a while I married, and had three children, two sons and a daughter. Then my wife died, and my nephew, who was now the captain of a ship, came home to see me. He knew that I did not really like a quiet life.
'I have a fine ship, uncle,' he said. 'I'm going out to the East Indies. Why don't you come with me?'
So, in 1694, I went to sea, and had many more adventures.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1374,"There were eleven men in the boat, but three of them were prisoners. Their arms were tied with rope, but their legs were free and they could walk. The other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach, laughing and shouting and hitting them. Then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink. Others walked away to look at the island, and two men stayed to watch the boat. The three prisoners walked slowly along the beach and sat down under a tree, not far from us. They looked very unhappy.
Very quietly, I came up behind them through the trees, and called out to them in English.
'Don't be afraid,' I said. 'I'm an Englishman. Perhaps I can help you.'
The three men turned and looked at me. They did not answer at once; they were too surprised.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1375,"Perhaps the men thought I was a wild man myself, in my strange homemade clothes, and with my long hair and beard. Then the oldest man spoke.
'I am the captain of that ship,' he said, 'and these two men are my first and second officers. Last night there was a mutiny, and the seamen took the ship from me. Now they're going to leave the three of us here, to die on this island.'
'Do these mutineers have guns?'
'Only two,' he answered, 'and they've left those on the boat.'
'All right,' I said. 'We'll fight them, but if we get your ship back for you, you must take me back to England.'
The captain agreed immediately and thanked me very warmly for my help. Friday ran back to my house to get all the guns, and the captain and I made a plan.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1379,"Then one year something happened which I can never forget. I was again on the west side of the island and was walking along the shore. Suddenly, I saw something which made me feel ill. There were different parts of men's bodies everywhere. For a minute, I couldn't think, and then I understood. Sometimes there were fights between the wild men on the other islands.
Slowly, I went home, but I was very angry. How could men do this? For many months I watched carefully for the smoke from fires, but I didn't see anything. Somehow the wild men came and went, and I never saw them. I was angry and afraid. I wanted to shoot them all, but there were many of them and only one of me.
'Perhaps I can shoot two or three,' I said to myself, 'but then they will kill and eat me.'",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

1392,And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.,robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

1400,"Nobody seemed to care about Mary. She was born in India, where her father was a British official. He was busy with his work, and her mother, who was very beautiful, spent all her time going to parties. So an Indian woman, Kamala, was paid to take care of the little girl. Mary was not a pretty child. She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair. She was always giving orders to Kamala, who had to obey. Mary never thought of other people, but only of herself. In fact, she was a very selfish, disagreeable, bad tempered little girl. One very hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she woke up and saw that instead of Kamala there was a different Indian servant by her bed. 'What are you doing here?' she asked crossly. She was furious.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1402,"After the long sea journey, Mary was met in London by Mr Craven's housekeeper, Mrs Medlock. Together they travelled north by train. Mrs Medlock was a large woman, with a very red face and bright black eyes. Mary did not like her, but that was not surprising, because she did not usually like people. Mrs Medlock did not like Mary either.
'What a disagreeable child!' thought the housekeeper. 'But perhaps I should talk to her.'
'I can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like,' she said aloud. 'He lives in a big old house, a long way from anywhere. There are nearly a hundred rooms, but most of them are shut and locked. There's a big park round the house, and all kinds of gardens. Well, what do you think of that?'
'Nothing,' replied Mary. 'It doesn't matter to me.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1403,"Mary stared out of the train window at the grey sky and the rain. She was not looking forward to life at her uncle's house. The train journey lasted all day, and it was dark when they arrived at the station. Then there was a long drive to get to the house. It was a cold, windy night, and it was raining heavily. After a while, Mary began to hear a strange, wild noise. She looked out of the window, but could see nothing except the darkness.
'What's that noise?' she asked Mrs Medlock. 'It's not the sea, is it?'
'No, that's the moor. It's the sound the wind makes, blowing across the moor.'
'What is a moor?'
'It's just miles and miles of wild land, with no trees or houses. Your uncle's house is right on the edge of the moor.'
Mary listened to the strange sound. 'I don't like it,' she thought.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1404,"Mrs Medlock and Mary arrived at a very large old house. It looked dark and unfriendly from the outside. Inside, Mary looked around the big shadowy hall, and felt very small and lost. They went straight upstairs. Mary was shown to a room where there was a warm fire and food on the table.
'This is your room,' said Mrs Medlock. 'Go to bed when you've had some supper. And remember, you must stay in your room! Mr Craven doesn't want you to wander all over the house!'
When Mary woke up the next morning, she saw a young servant girl cleaning the fireplace. The room seemed dark and rather strange, with pictures of dogs and horses and ladies on the walls. It was not a child's room at all. From the window she could not see any trees or houses, only wild land, which looked like a kind of purple sea.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1405,"Martha woke up and stared a young servant.
'You'll have to learn to play by yourself. Dickon plays by himself on the moors for hours, with the wild birds, and the sheep, and the other animals.' She looked away for a moment. 'Perhaps I shouldn't tell you this, but - but one of the walled gardens is locked up. Nobody's been in it for ten years. It was Mrs Craven's garden, and when she died so suddenly, Mr Craven locked it and buried the key - Oh, I must go, I can hear Mrs Medlock's bell ringing for me.'
Mary went downstairs and wandered through the great empty gardens.
'How ugly it all looks in winter!' she thought. 'But what a mystery the locked garden is! Why did my uncle bury the key? If he loved his wife, why did he hate her garden? Perhaps I'll never know.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1406,"In the next few days Mary spent almost all her time in the gardens. The fresh air from the moor made her hungry, and she was becoming stronger and healthier. One day she noticed the robin again. He was on top of a wall, singing to her.
'Good morning! Isn't this fun! Come this way!' he seemed to say, as he hopped along the wall Mary began to laugh as she danced along beside him.
'I know the secret garden's on the other side of this wall!' she thought excitedly. 'And the robin lives there! But where's the door?'
That evening she asked Martha to stay and talk to her beside the fire after supper. They could hear the wind blowing round the old house, but the room was warm and comfortable. Mary only had one idea in her head.
'Tell me about the secret garden,' she said.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1407,"The next day it was very rainy, so Mary did not go out. Instead she decided to wander round the house, looking into some of the hundred rooms that Mrs Medlock had told her about. She spent all morning going in and out of dark, silent rooms, which were full of heavy furniture and old pictures. She saw no servants at all, and was on her way back to her room for lunch, when she heard a cry.
'It's a bit like the cry that I heard last night!' she thought. Just then the housekeeper, Mrs Medlock, appeared, with her keys in her hand.
'You didn't hear anything! Go back to your room now. And if you don't stay there, I'll lock you in!'
Mary hated Mrs Medlock for this.
There was someone crying, I know there was!' she said to herself. 'But I'll discover who it is soon!'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1409,"Mary was walking beside the long wall of the secret garden, when the most wonderful thing happened. She suddenly realized the robin was following her. She felt very pleased and excited by this, and cried out, 'You like me, don't you? And I like you too!'
As he hopped along beside her, she hopped and sang too, to show him that she was his friend. Just then he stopped at a place where a dog had dug a hole in the ground. As Mary looked at the hole, she noticed something almost buried there. She put her hand in and pulled it out. It was an old key.
'Perhaps it's been buried for ten years,' she whispered to herself. 'Perhaps it's the key to the secret garden!'
She looked at it for a long time. How lovely it would be to find the garden, and see what had happened to it in the last ten years!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1410,"Mary skipped all the way to the secret garden wall. And there was the robin! He had followed her!
'You showed me where the key was yesterday,' she laughed. 'I've got it in my pocket. So you ought to show me the door today!'
The robin hopped on to an old climbing plant on the wall, and sang his most beautiful song. Suddenly the wind made the plant move, and Mary saw something under the dark green leaves. The thick, heavy plant was covering a door. Mary's heart was beating fast and her hands were shaking as she pushed the leaves away and found the keyhole. She took the key out of her pocket, and it fitted the hole. Using both hands, she managed to unlock the door. She pushed the door, which opened, slowly, for the first time in ten years. At last she was inside the secret garden!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1411,"Mary almost forgot about lunch, and when she arrived back in her room, she was very hungry and ate twice as much as usual.
'Martha,' she said as she was eating, 'I've been thinking. This is a big, lonely house, and there isn't much for me to do. Do you think, if I buy a little spade, I can make my own garden?'
'That's just what Mother said,' replied Martha. 'You'd enjoy digging and watching plants growing. Dickon can get you a spade, and some seeds to plant if you like.'
'Oh, thank you, Martha! I've got some money that Mrs Medlock gave me. Will you write and ask Dickon to buy a spade and some seeds for me?'
'I will. And he'll bring them to you himself.'
'Oh! Then I'll see him.' Mary looked very excited.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1412,"In the middle of the night Mary woke up. Suddenly she heard crying again. This time she decided to discover who it was. She left her room, and in the darkness followed the crying sound, round corners and through doors, up and down stairs, to the other side of the big house. At last she found the right room. She pushed the door open and went in. It was a big room with beautiful old furniture and pictures. In the large bed was a boy, who looked tired and cross, with a thin, white, tearful face. He stared at Mary.
'Who are you?' he whispered. 'Are you a dream?'
'No, I'm not. I'm Mary Lennox. Mr Craven's my uncle.'
'He's my father,' said the boy. 'I'm Colin Craven.'
'No one ever told me he had a son!' said Mary, very surprised.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1416,"Colin covered his eyes with his hands until he was inside the four high walls, and the door was shut again. Then he looked round at the roses climbing the old red walls, the pink and white flowers on the fruit trees, and the birds and the butterflies everywhere. The sun warmed his face, and he suddenly knew he felt different.
'Mary! Dickon!' he cried. 'I'm going to get better! I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!'
As Dickon pushed the wheelchair all round the garden, he told Colin the names of all the plants. The sun shone, the birds sang, and in every corner of the garden there was something interesting to look at. The three children talked and laughed, and by the end of the afternoon all three were speaking Yorkshire together.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
1417,"That morning Mr Craven received a letter from Susan Sowerby. In it she asked him to come home, but she did not give a reason. Mr Craven thought of his dream, and decided to return to England immediately. On the long journey back to Yorkshire, he was thinking about Colin.
'I wonder how he is! I wanted to forget him, because he makes me think of his mother. He lived, and she died! But perhaps I've been wrong.'
When he arrived home, he found the housekeeper very confused about Colin's health.
'He's very strange, sir,' said Mrs Medlock. 'He used to scream even at the idea of fresh air, but now he spends all his time outside in his wheelchair, with Miss Mary and Dickon Sowerby. He's in the garden at the moment.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'How can I have done that?' she thought. ' I must be growing small again.'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
That was a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but the little door was shut again, and the golden key was lying on the glass table.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?'
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying. So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'.
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1
1493,"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!', Alice cried to the mouse.
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves — that is, if I can find them.'

'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

'One side of WHAT The other side of WHAT' thought Alice to herself.
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see — how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and she decided to bite it.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

1570,"The Pareto principle (also known as the ""80-20 rule"") says that for many things, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found that a similar distribution applied. These days, the Pareto principle can be applied to a number of different scenarios. In business, directors often use the Pareto principle to analyse the company. For example, they may find that 80% of the sales come from 20% of their clients; or that 20% of the workforce creates 80% of the company's wealth.",different stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

1711,"Whenever I visit Switzerland, I go through several stages of punctuality reaction. At first it delights me, especially if I'm coming from neighbouring Italy or France with their rather more flexible approach to timekeeping. By contrast, life in Switzerland is sturdy and dependable. If someone says they will meet me at 2 pm, they arrive at 2 pm not 2:05 (or 1:55, for that matter). I like this. For a while.
Then it annoys me. The extreme punctuality strikes me as a kind of stinginess.
That is unfair though, and finally, invariably, I come to appreciate Swiss punctuality for what it is: a deep expression of respect for other people. A punctual person is a considerate one. By showing up on time – for everything – a Swiss person is saying, in effect, ""I value your time and, by extension, I value you.""",traveling part 1,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Susan Jane Gilman, an American author who has lived in Geneva for the past 11 years, recounted with awe how she's ""never had a taxi that arrived late, that wasn't there exactly when it said it would be"". She marvelled at how, for instance, when she's ordered a new refrigerator, the company gives her a precise two-hour window for delivery – and sticks to it.
Switzerland has changed her. Once a ""chronically late person"", Gilman is now meticulously punctual. ""I feel a greater respect for people's time,"" she said, sounding very Swiss.",traveling part 1,4,Intermediate,2,-2

""My friends will say 'Suze, this isn't Switzerland, relax. They'll hold our table.' But I've gotten anal. I get annoyed if people are late."" Punctuality is not without its drawbacks. For one thing, it creates a kind of bunching effect. Coffee shops in Swiss cities tend to be crowded at 4 p.m. every day because everybody takes their coffee break at exactly 4 p.m. In apartment buildings, residents must abide by a strict weekday schedule for use of the laundry room.

It's a stunning, but potentially dangerous sight. This potent greenhouse gas not only warms the planet, but also is highly flammable.

They were a garage rock band, which is a type of very funky rock influenced by punk. They had a UK number-one album but broke up due to Doherty's problems with drugs. Later he formed the band Babyshambles, which plays various types of music, including punk and ska. However, Pete Doherty has become more famous for his continuing problems with drugs and his fiery relationship with top model Kate Moss.

Chris Martin, the singer-guitarist-pianist is very public about issues such as human rights and fair trade for third world countries. They have won a Grammy before for their song Clocks. And their seventh album A Head Full of Dreams reached the number-one position in the UK charts and number two in the US, Australia, Canada and Italy. Coldplay's style of music has been compared to Oasis and Radiohead. They themselves have described it as ""very heavy soft rock"". Some of their music has a very sad feeling to it but it has struck a chord with many music fans. One impressive thing that the band have done is to give 10% of their profits to charity.",music,4,Intermediate,2,-2

This was a type of music focused on the British style of guitar playing and lyrics about things that affect British people. Oasis' second album What's the Story Morning Glory is considered by many to be their best. Their singer, Liam Gallagher, is known as a wildman and has had many public bust-ups with other musicians. They were involved in the ""Battle of Britpop"" in 1995 with Blur. This was when the British press decided that there was rivalry between the bands, and a battle for sales of singles took place. Blur won the battle. When the Britpop movement ended in the late 1990s, Oasis lost popularity and several band members left. Liam continued with the band until 2014. Noel started a solo career.",music,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Their music was originally psychedelic and Syd was known for his bizzare performances. He once mixed powder and hair cream then put the mix in his hair before a concert. As the heat of the lights melted the mixture, the audience thought Syd's face was melting. Eventually Syd was replaced by David Gilmour and faded into obscurity. He died in 2006. As the 1970s progressed, so did the music. ""Dark side of the Moon"" and ""The Wall"" are two of the biggest-selling albums in history.

1858,"A memorable celebrity publicity stunt occurred on 24th March 1958. That was the day Elvis Presley enlisted in the US army. There was no war at the time, but Elvis's peacetime draft in the army lasted until 1960. At the time, many conservatives believed that Elvis's music was corrupting America's children. So, Elvis's management agency thought it would be a good idea to send him away to the army. They wanted him to appear like an ordinary person, but the stunt had the opposite effect and actually helped promote Elvis even more. As a result, Elvis's career really took off. Publicity sought for publicity's sake can be a powerful force. It can resuscitate a business, harm a business or even create legends.",music,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Please don't die.'"" Simmons, who afterwards lost 55 kilos, admits that he lost the weight in unhealthy ways. So, in an effort to present alternative weight loss options, Simmons made a fitness videotape series called ""Sweatin' to the Oldies."" On the tapes, he leads exercise routines, and has a band behind him singing dance classics from the 1950s and 1960s. His tapes have sold over 20 million copies.

His incredible career began over 50 years ago, and he went through some remarkable changes in terms of both music and fashion. David Bowie's first single was The Laughing Gnome, which was released in 1967. It wasn't successful. And nor was his first album. In fact, Bowie had to wait for his first hit record, Space Oddity, which he released in 1969. But even then, his next two albums weren't very popular, although Hunky Dory (1971) is now thought of as a classic. But everything changed in 1972. For his album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Bowie combined both music and fashion.

1861,"Economist Sherwin Rosen developed the idea of the Superstar Premium in the early 1980s to explain why some musicians were earning so much money. Before technology and the internet, even the most popular musicians earnings depended on the number of people who could hear them perform live. These days, the celebrities can reach a much wider audience, and therefore earn much more money from doing the same amount of work. Vanessa Mae is a typical example. She is the world's most popular violinist, and she has a global fan base. ""The exposure that you get around the world is only thanks to technology,"" she says. ""If I had to sell my albums 50 years ago, it would have taken me five years to promote one album.

1862,"Street musicians have been a part of city life for centuries. But more and more places are imposing restrictions on buskers. Is that fair? Many famous musicians started out as buskers. Guitarist Eric Clapton left school in 1961 and busked around London. Buskers are seen as good for tourism, and as a way of bringing the streets to life. However, more and more cities are cracking down on them. Camden (an area in northern London) is one such example. Street musicians now need to pay an annual licence fee, and there are fines of up to £1,000 for not complying with the law. Jessica Tosh, who lives in Camden Town, told the Guardian newspaper, ""Residents don't want to banish music from the borough; we just don't want buskers to force their choice of music on us at their choice of time.""",music,4,Intermediate,2,-2
1864,"In the mid-1950s American rock and roll performers such as Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry commanded worldwide attention. By the 1960s English bands such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were taking popular music in new directions. Rock strongly influenced disco, reggae, punk, rap, hip-hop, and other styles in the late 20th century. Radio and the recording industry introduced non-Western cultures to these new forms of popular music. Traditional songs were performed in new styles, and at the same time, traditional instruments gave the new music an entirely different sound. This mixing of styles and sounds became ""world music"" and ""worldbeat."" Today worldbeat blends a wide range of sounds and rhythms.",music,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
1865,"Jazz music is very hard to define because it changes all the time. It has its roots in America's folk traditions, especially in the music of slaves taken from Africa. But today musicians from many countries play jazz and make their own contributions to it. Early jazz borrowed from slaves' field hollers (a kind of musical calling-out) and work songs and from African American hymns and spirituals. Soon it adopted music from funeral processions and popular dance music. Chicago and New York City emerged as major jazz centers. Talented musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke and Louis Armstrong formed bands. And jazz spread to Europe. France especially welcomed jazz music and musicians—many not valued in the United States simply because they were black.",music,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
1866,"In the West the term ""classical music"" usually refers to sonatas, chamber music, operas, and symphonies from the late 1700s through the 1800s.
Classical music is a very formal kind of music. This makes classical different from forms such as jazz or folk music. Classical music has set fairly complex patterns that all classical composers (writers of music) and musicians understand and follow. A sonata is made up of three parts that focus, in different ways, on a main musical theme, or special tune. The first part presents the theme. In the second part the theme is developed and played in different ways. The third part repeats the theme. A symphony is a longer composition created to be played by an orchestra. A symphony has several sections called ""movements.""",music,4,Intermediate,2,-2
1867,"When he was only three years old in Salzburg, Austria, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart used to join his elder sister, Maria Anna, for her music lessons. But by the time he was five, Mozart was making up his own music. In the 18th century, when Mozart lived, most people didn't believe that a little boy could write such beautiful music. So to test him, they asked young Mozart to stay in a room alone for a week. At the end of the week, Mozart had written a new piece of choir music. Mozart often blended popular and classical music to create new styles of music. Mozart could hear a piece once and then play it from memory, sometimes rewriting and improving it as he played. Although he died when he was still a young man, Mozart wrote 16 operas, 41 symphonies, and more than 500 other pieces of music.",music,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Rolling Stone that the Republican candidate continues to be a Neil Young fan, regardless of the musician's political views, and as such ""will respect his wish and not use the song because it's the right thing to do.""

""Billie Jean"" is the most important record he made, not only because of its commercial success but because of the musical depth of the record. It has more hooks in it than anything I've ever heard.

Many folk performers haven't studied music in school, but they learned songs by listening to others play and sing.

Gradually, creating buildings became an activity for experts—an art and occupation that came to be known as ""architecture."" Today architecture is a refined art requiring a lot of training, years of practice, and plenty of talent. An architect's work is to imagine and plan a building and then to supervise its construction.

Until the middle of the 20th century, most sculpture was meant to look like some person or thing. Some modern sculptures may be abstract. This means they only hint at an object or an idea. Sculptures come in all sizes, shapes, textures, and materials. Sculptors may use soft materials such as clay, wax, or wood or harder materials such as stone or metal.

Social dances were performed on special occasions, such as births or marriages. Religious dances were performed to ask the gods for help, such as to provide rain or cure the sick. Over the years, many early forms became folk dances. These continue to be enjoyed to traditional music. Some dances, however, became the specialty of professional artists.

But even books for young readers, such as The Cat in the Hat or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be literature.

Traditional opera tells a big story in a grand way. The story is usually serious, though there are comic operas too. Many operas tell tragic tales of lovers who are kept apart. Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde is one of these. Some operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute, tell a story of mystery and enchantment.

1909,"Until recently, all music had to be sung or played in person. In the 18th century, people began to find ways to play music automatically. They created musical clocks, player pianos, and music boxes. With the help of water power, clockwork, and steam, these instruments made music without needing people to play them.
In the late 1800s, the earliest recording devices were invented. These allowed people to make copies of musical performances.

Even books come and go—many that you see in stores today won't be around decades from now. On the other hand, most newspaper articles are read once and tossed aside.

But a new app aims to change how you view time, by moving beyond hours, minutes and seconds to reveal your position in the cosmos and relate that position to the movement of celestial bodies. The app, named the Cosmic Watch, can tell you what the solar system was like when you were born, or set the scene for the next solar eclipse. 'The app provides a vivid view of the cosmos to show how time reflects our position in the solar system,' said Markus Humbel, co-founder of the app. The Cosmic Watch operates in three modes: ""world clock mode"" for timekeeping based on the atomic clock, ""astronomy mode"" to view constellations and planets in the sky, and ""astrology mode"" to view astral charts.",make it digital,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

You're playing against Cardiff City this afternoon.' Edwards was the youngest footballer in a Division One team. In 1955, Edwards became the youngest English international player when he played for England. This was a record until Liverpool's Michael Owen played for England in 1998.

He did not like being away from home and he returned to Northern Ireland after a few weeks. His father sent him back to Manchester and he first played in the team in 1963. One success followed another. In 1966 he scored two goals against Benfica, when United won 5-1 . The Portuguese called him 'El Beatle', because he had long hair like the Beatles.

They were looking for boys who could play football. Managers then were usually not very interested in training. But Busby was an unusual man. He put on his sports clothes and trained with his footballers. Sadly, Busby lost some of his best young players in the Munich air crash. He began again,looking for new young players.

With three Cups in three weeks, he is the most successful manager in football. He is also the best Manchester United manager since Sir Matt Busby. The fans think this is the greatest football team.

When he scored a goal, he always put his right arm up. Fans saw Law's right arm in the air thirty times in 1963-1964. He was named European Footballer of the Year that year.

The long jump is an event where the winner jumps the longest distance.
The world record for the long jump, which was set in 1968, remained unbroken for 23 years after African-American athlete Bob Beaman jumped 8.9 metres. The high jump was revolutionised during the 1968 Olympics with the invention of the Fosbury Flop. This was a technique with which the competitor jumps over the bar while looking away from the crossbar. This method wasn't possible before as the landing area used to be a sandpit so the invention of foam matting meant jumpers could experiment with new techniques.",sport,4,Intermediate,2,-2

However, with the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak an international public health emergency, you may well think we have every reason to be concerned. But in a developed country such as the UK, with well-developed communication and quarantine facilities, Ebola hasn't got the disease profile to spread. To date, there has never been a case of Ebola transmission within Europe. No doubt headlines about the disease will keep popping up on the news, but the average Brit just now would have to be drastically unlucky to contract Ebola.",health,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

The weather is miserable, days are shorter and going back to work after a break is always going to be tough.' Unfortunately there is no clear-cut test for depression, but the two main signs to watch out for according to Murphy are withdrawing from life and hopelessness. 'Firstly, not being interested in things that you're normally interested in, for example not taking part in social activities and hobbies or even not being able to go to work - withdrawing from your life a little bit.' 'The second thing is hopelessness. If you're feeling very low and hopeless and saying things like, 'I can't see the point anymore,' then that's another sign to watch out for.'",health,4,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-3

Unfortunately, people confuse being a good parent with having a rigid routine, but ironically, the opposite is true.' Anxiety and parenting seem to go hand-in-hand, and my own need for control is certainly borne out of fear – a fear that if I don't, everything will fall apart.

'I remember one brother and sister who came to couple therapy because they felt it was so important to restore their relationship,' says psychologist and therapist Martin Lloyd-Elliott. Watching my own children, I can see their bond is complex and intense, full of extreme displays of frustration, resentment but also intimacy and love. I hope they can sustain that closeness in adulthood without the rivalry that seems so second nature to them now. You may compete with your siblings all your life, but you are also deeply bonded to them.

The process involved in creating sibling rivalry is familiar to us: siblings compete for the attention and exclusive love of their parents, and they feel that this is stolen by their brothers and sisters. This dynamic often continues into adulthood and can become a bitter conflict. This is because, according to Freud, 'the unconscious isn't aware of passing time'. 'Children who didn't get enough recognition from their parents can remain stuck in needy relationships all their lives,' says child psychiatrist Sarah Stern. The recognition we longed to see in our parents' eyes, we start to look for elsewhere – friends, bosses, lovers.

One of the best gifts you can give your child is the independence to make their own decisions. 'Many of us were managers before we were parents, so it can help to think of it as delegation,' says Gardner. 'When you delegate something, you don't expect the other person to do it precisely as you would.'

She advises praising boys at every opportunity, especially when they're little; avoiding criticism and unfavourable comparisons; accepting the ways in which they are different from girls, and rewarding them for the many things they are naturally good at. 'Boys are wonderful problem-solvers. They are very good at coming up with innovative solutions. Boys are very responsive to praise, but it works the other way too: if we make them feel unaccepted and unacceptable, they will quickly start to misbehave and play up.' For many mothers, this means being aware of their own inbuilt bias towards girls and femaleness.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
2341,"Boys are not just different from girls, but also in many ways more vulnerable. Boys are born six weeks behind girls developmentally, a gap that widens throughout childhood right up to puberty, by which time they are two years behind. In infancy, boys cry more, take longer to settle, are slower to learn to walk, talk and potty train. They have more difficulty adapting to school. Reading, writing, sitting still all come harder to small boys. Socially, too, they lag behind girls. Behavioural problems and mental illnesses are more common at all ages in boys than girls. In adolescence, boys do less well at school, leave school earlier, and are more likely than girls to die, in road accidents, from substance abuse, in fights and by suicide. The vast majority of young offenders are boys.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1
2342,"'A mother teaches a boy a great deal about life and love,' says Biddulph. 'She is his ""first love"", and needs to be tender, respectful and playful, without dominating his world.' Mothers invariably take the lead in this social learning. 'It never occurs to my husband to ask our sons how they're feeling,' says Helena, 41. 'I always encouraged my boys to talk. But you can't just sit them down and say ""talk to me"" like you might with a girl. You have to come at it sideways.' Perhaps the hardest task of all for mothers is knowing how and when to let their sons go. As boys mature, mothers have to let them push us away at times. As they get older, boys need to feel they're in charge of their lives. That means letting them make mistakes and letting them set their own boundaries.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2
2343,"Play to a child is what work is to an adult. It is how children learn, grow, have fun and overcome challenges. It is the way by which they make sense of the world and learn how to be within it. Thankfully, we have moved away from the era of regarding children's play as a mere way to pass the time. It is now known that play is essential to a child's development and wellbeing. Offering your child a mix of play opportunities is the ideal. Children need to imagine and they need to act out (as language is still not their main mode of expression) and play gives them a safe structure within which to do this and in a way which they can control (in contrast to the rest of a child's life which is heavily controlled by adults around them).",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

If the dirt gets in their mouths, don't freak out; they'll soon realize that dirt doesn't taste all that good and likely won't develop a habit for it. Most kids have this innate desire to get dirty, but in their modern lives this needs to be nurtured. Do your child a favor and encourage her to play with dirt!",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2
2345,"The authors propose a couple of reasons why a happy person might improve the health of their lover. First, a happy spouse is a better caretaker; he or she is more likely to have the emotional energy to look after a significant other. Secondly, happy spouses make life easier for their partners because their partners aren't stressed by the fact that their closest companion is always in a bad mood, and they're not exhausted by efforts to jolly them along or under constant pressure not to upset them. One of the ways the researchers think this works is that the happy soul becomes a proxy for their partner, so the gloomy individual behaves as a non-gloomy person would. ""It's compensatory,"" says Chopik. ""Another person's happiness is filling you up, so you do these healthy things.""",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

His team's studies of kids' connections with extended family uncovered an important principle: ""the more kids know about their families, the stronger they are."" From the elementary age on, Duke says, the most important thing to do is simply make space for kids to hear family stories,"" says Duke.

That's when many parents turn to threats, force, and ordering kids around. One of the best ways to build a bridge between your reality and the child's is through empathy. When we practice empathy with our kids, we show respect for their feelings and their unique experience of the world. Practicing empathy shows that we are really listening, and that we understand their point of view. Not respecting our children's reality is something we are generally unaware of doing. We really have to pay attention to notice the ways in which we unintentionally disregard or question their feelings and perspective.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Parents may be surprised to learn kids are feeling leery of sea creatures, or bothered by the sun, and take the opportunity to talk more about sharing the water with wildlife, or the importance of sunscreen—as well as getting across the absolute basics of beach safety: young kids shouldn't go into deep water, and should always stay near their parents or a lifeguard.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Parents can encourage play by following their child's lead, stepping in and out when needed, and going with their child's flow of play. Children structure their play very differently to how adults would, so it's important not to put your own agenda onto the play. I would argue there is no such thing as unhealthy play. If during active physical play children hit each other and become upset, then that kind of play can be discouraged, but otherwise the rest of the play time can be seen as healthy. Even moments of disagreement can be healthy as they are valuable opportunities for children to learn about themselves and others through developing skills of negotiation.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Research with siblings has shown that a child's play is more sophisticated and complex if they are playing with older siblings.

If you are a bilingual family (or have a bilingual caregiver), have one parent (and/or caregiver) speak the second language to the baby all the time so he has a chance to become fully ""immersed"" in it. If you haven't begun the second language in the first year, it's best to wait until your child is about 2-1/2 - or until after he has undergone a ""vocabulary explosion"" in his first language, which generally begins at 18 to 20 months.",family,4,Intermediate,2,-2

It's a limited freedom that lets them explore their free will. Later, you will attach consequences to these choices – if you make the wrong choice, then there is a price to be paid.

Many were attracted by the availability of still-affordable farmland, as well as by the opportunities created by business developer Frank Jao (himself a Vietnamese refugee), who began to build shopping centers and residences that eventually formed the nucleus of Little Saigon, says Hien Do, professor of sociology at San Jose State University. Other Vietnamese immigrants relocated to San Jose. As a result, the Vietnamese population in San Jose swelled to more than 100,000, the largest of any city outside of Saigon.",history,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

They moved across Europe and covered a large area from modern-day Turkey to Spain. Irish Celts are thought to have come to Ireland from northern Spain about 3,000 years ago. When the Celts got to Ireland, they brought many skills and traditions with them, including their use of iron instead of bronze, the Gaelic language and their music. It was here that the culture of the Celts survived in its strongest sense until modern times. One reason for this was the fact that the Romans never invaded Ireland so the culture was left intact for many centuries.

In 1963, fifteen robbers hijacked the Post Office train travelling between Glasgow and London. £2,631,784 was stolen from the train and the driver was seriously assaulted.
The robbery became known as the Great Train Robbery. After a year and a half in prison, Biggs escaped, took much of the money with him and went to Rio de Janeiro where he was safe from extradition. There was no agreement between Brazil and Britain so he lived freely until 2001 when he returned voluntarily to prison in the UK. Ronnie Biggs said that he just wanted to die close to his family.

Using anything they could, including nail clippers and spoons, three men managed the impossible on 11th June 1962. Frank Morris and Brothers Clarence and John Anglin dug their way out of Alcatraz. They dug through the concrete and escaped through the ventilation system. It took six months. They covered their tunnels with a paste made out of wet newspaper.

It's called the Dickin Medal, and it's given to animals who show bravery and devotion to duty whilst serving with the armed forces or civil emergency services.
The award was created by (and named after) Maria Dickin in 1943. She had previously established the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) – an organisation that took care of injured animals.

In this atmosphere of hostility, a group of Modenese soldiers slipped into the centre of Bologna and stole a wooden bucket filled with money and jewels. The Bolognese demanded the return of the bucket. The Modenese refused, so the Bolognse declared war on Modena. Bologna put together an army of 32,000 men and marched against Modena in November 1325. Over 7,000 Modenese met them in Bolognese territory. Despite being seriously outnumbered, the Modenese won the Battle of Zappolino (the only battle of the war) and the Bolognese fled to their city.

Nevertheless, Elizabeth was well cared for as a child and received an excellent education. She was known as The Virgin Queen and never married. She ruled conservatively and was careful about entering into alliances. She also surrounded herself with trusted political advisers. The defeat of the Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth's name with what is seen as one of the greatest victories in British history.

He had one great ambition in his life: to produce a son to succeed him to the throne. But this was easier said than done. Finally, one of his wives, (Jane Seymour), gave birth to a son, Edward (the future King Edward VI), although he died at a very young age. Henry was known for his cruelty and ruled with an iron-fist. But Henry also made some of the most radical decisions of any English monarch. Most importantly, he broke away from the Roman Catholic Church to form the Church of England (the Anglican Church).

Curiously, they continued on a more or less straight path for over 150 km, passing over any obstacle: rooftops, walls, hills, frozen rivers... On top of that, during that same period, several witnesses in the area claimed that they'd seen a ""diabolical figure"". Recently, in March 2009, similar traces appeared in the same area.

Scientists there wanted to investigate whether the fish could provide an abundant food source during a period of protein shortage in Japan following the Second World War. The bluegill fish proved to be very aggressive. They soon spread into the wild where they destroyed large stocks of domestic fish.

This does not mean sitting in class looking out the window, nor listening to other students who do not speak well, nor getting explanations in your own language about how the language works. This means spending time enjoyably connected to the language you are learning. Start to notice words and how they come together as phrases.

Enjoy studying all the time and stop worrying about what you cannot remember, or cannot yet understand, or cannot yet say.

Even if you study English at a language school it doesn't mean you can't learn outside the class. Using as many different sources, methods and tools as possible, will allow you to learn faster.

For Aaron Ralby, director of Linguisticator, this debate misses the point: ""The question is not so much about online vs offline or app vs book. Rather it should be how can we assemble the necessary elements of language for a particular objective, present them in a user-friendly way, and provide a means for students to understand those elements."" When signing up to a particular method or approach, think about the substance behind the style or technology.

Once you get started, it's easy to get past the idea that studying a foreign language comes with a big financial burden.

You can easily make a container, order one online or buy it at a hardware or gardening store. Look for a bin that's about 3 feet in diameter and not much taller than your waist. If you start a pile, protect it from animals such as raccoons using fencing.",home,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Clear plastic containers are best—they lock fibers in and dust out and let you see what's inside. When you dust, they're easy to pull off the shelves and wipe clean. Finally, keep closet floors clear. If the floor is cluttered, chances are you'll just bypass it while vacuuming, and dust bunnies will start to collect.

Interestingly, no matter how rational we think we are, most of our decisions are made by our intuitive mind, which is faster, more easily accessed, and tends to override our slower, logical mind.

Two principles are crucial here. The first is what the productivity guru David Allen calls 'universal capture'. Make sure that wherever you are – in the bathroom, at the gym – you have some way to take a note when tasks spring to mind. The second is to keep matters simple.

So if you're aiming to exercise more, for example, pros would include as many reasons as possible to support that (e.g., you'll lose weight, sleep better, boost your immunity, and lower stress).
The cons would identify anything that might stand in the way of your success—say, a packed schedule or money issues.

""Since optimists expect good things to happen in the future, when they realize that something is unrealistic, they identify the alternatives and deviate from their original goal,"" he explains. To set yourself up for success, it can be helpful to build in alternatives early on. Rather than focusing on achieving one specific goal, create A, B, and C goals for yourself. Your A goal is your ideal, your B goal is something that you would still be happy with, and the C goal is the better-than-nothing option.

First, he produced small blocks of metal with one raised, backward letter on each block. These blocks with their raised letters were called ""type."" He then spelled out words and sentences by lining up the individual pieces of type in holders.
The second part of his invention was the printing press. This was basically a ""bed"" in which the lines of type could be laid out to create a page. When he inked the type and then used a large plate to press them against a sheet of paper, lines of words were printed on the paper.

Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876. In 11 years there were more than 150,000 telephones in the United States.
Traditional telephones have three main parts: a transmitter, a receiver, and a dialer. There is also a switch hook, which hangs up and disconnects the call. When you speak into the phone, the transmitter changes the sound of your voice into an electrical signal. The transmitter is basically a tiny microphone in the mouthpiece. On the other end of the call, the receiver in the listener's earpiece changes that electrical signal back into sound. The receiver is a tiny vibrating disk, and the electrical signal vibrates the disk to make the sounds of the caller's voice.",inventions,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Each wire connects to an outlet or a switch. From the outlets electricity passes along the plugs and cords that go to a lamp or television.
Electricity moves easily along things that are made of metal, such as silver, copper, or iron. Electricity doesn't pass through rubber or plastic.

Windmills provide power to make electricity when their sails are turned by wind blowing against them. Originally the sails were long narrow sheets of canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Usually there are four sails shaped like large blades. When the sails turn, the axle they are attached to turns as well, much as car wheels turn on their axles. The axle causes various gears to turn, which then causes a large crankshaft to turn. At its other end the crankshaft is attached to a generator, a motor that can make and store electricity.

This heat can be used for warmth, made to power a machine directly, or converted into electricity. For example, a car engine burns gasoline (an oil product) for direct thermal power. In some areas coal is burned to produce the electricity that powers people's homes. In a very few parts of the world, an interesting third form of heat energy comes from ""living"" heat inside the Earth itself.

Later, larger waterwheels were used to run machines in factories. They were not very reliable, however. Floodwaters could create too much power, whereas long rainless periods left the factories without any power at all. Today streamlined metal waterwheels called ""turbines"" help produce electricity.

One excellent aspect of water power is that the water can be reused. Unlike such fuels as coal and oil, water does not get used up when harnessed for power. And it doesn't pollute the air either. The power of water lies in the flow of water. The power produced by water depends upon the water's weight and its height of fall, called ""head."" Generally, the faster that water moves, the more power it can generate. That's why water flowing from a higher place to a lower place, as a waterfall does, can produce so much energy.",inventions,4,Intermediate,2,-2

But since everybody's thumbs, feet, and arms were different sizes, so were everybody's inches, feet, and yards.
Finally, in the 1800s, all these terms were standardized. They became part of the English system of measurement, the British Imperial System.

Studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is likely to affect at least over half of all British people, but it plays a crucial role in providing protection against multiple diseases, the regulation of calcium, boosting immunity and even fighting depression.
Recent studies found that taking Vitamin D alongside standard asthma medicines cuts the risk of severe asthma attacks.
According to the findings, led by experts at Queen Mary University of London, the results are more than just a breath of fresh air - the number of asthma attacks decreased from 6% to 3%.

Right now, while the mercury's high and the sun is shining, you're probably less tempted by the heavy, carb-laden comfort foods that are so enticing in the middle of winter anyway. So take advantage of that and choose potent fat-melting foods.
Those that are loaded with vitamin D and other nutrients preserve muscle mass, turn up the heat on metabolism, and encourage your body to incinerate fat, not hang on to it. Snacks rich in vitamin D will help you get the amount you need (around 600 IU in the summer months).",nutrition,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

For starters, the skins are packed with nutrients like vitamin A, lutein, and other antioxidants, including B vitamins, which your body needs to keep its metabolism stoked. What's more, they have tons of soluble and insoluble fibre, even more than the fruit itself—both can slow digestion, boost feelings of fullness, and even work to lower cholesterol.
Choose green peels, which are better for cooking, and you'll also get a big dose of probiotics, which increasing research shows are essential to balancing the body's internal flora for weight loss.

Well, take a bite out of this: Being that person may actually help you shed pounds. Researchers from Brigham Young and Colorado State Universities had college students eat cookies with three different cues in mind: eat as loudly as possible, eat normally, and eat as quietly as possible.
After completing two similar experiments, each involving around 200 participants, the study authors found that people who chomped the loudest ate significantly less than the rest. The study authors believe that consciously being aware of the food in your mouth forces you to eat more mindfully, which is key to really enjoying your food—and knowing when you've had enough.",nutrition,4,Intermediate,2,-2

Another 2013 analysis from the European Journal of Nutrition found that regular green tea drinkers weigh less and have smaller waists. Choose fresh, hot brewed tea with nothing added—store-bought bottled brews tend to have fewer antioxidants and can be loaded with excess sugar.

For a start, they offer really fresh, seasonal produce. And as it's grown nearby, it can help sustain the local economy and provide jobs for people in the area. On top of that, many small-scale farms use fewer pesticides or other harmful chemicals when growing their crops, so the food is better for you. And the food is often more environmentally friendly as it hasn't been on a long road journey to get there. So, where can you find farmers' markets?

Popcorn is high in antioxidants and fibre; and air-popped popcorn only has about 31 calories per cup, which is quite low compared to most other snack foods. So, why is popcorn so popular? There are lots of reasons: the delicious buttery smell, the way it's so light, crunchy and fluffy, and the fact that you don't feel full even after eating a lot of it. Scientists have even found that the carbohydrates in popcorn help bring the amino acid tryptophan into your brain, where it's used to produce serotonin – a chemical that literally makes you feel good.",food,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

During the American Revolution, the American colonists tried to seize control of the area. But the British held onto it. Eight out of every ten people in Quebec are of French ancestry. Because of this, both French and English are spoken in Quebec.",views of the americas,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

The mountains run north to south for the entire length of South America— 5,500 miles in all. They separate a narrow strip of land along the west coast from the rest of the continent. The Andes region is made up of many high plateaus surrounded by even higher peaks. In some sections, the chain separates into two ranges. The Cordillera Oriental is the eastern mountain range, and the Cordillera Occidental is the western range. The best-known people ever to live in the Andes were the Inca.

2756,"Around AD 1200 a group of Indians called the Inca formed the city of Cuzco in what is now Peru. From there they set out to conquer other Indian peoples along South America's west coast. Eventually the Inca ruled over as many as 12 million people. But their great empire was destroyed when Spanish soldiers seized the land in the 1530s. Spain ruled until Peru won its independence almost 300 years later. Today Peru still has many reminders of the Inca. The country's name comes from a word meaning ""land of abundance"" in Quechua, the Inca language. Indians who still speak the Quechua language make up about half of Peru's population. And in the Andes there is Machu Picchu. The remarkable stone remains of this Inca settlement attract visitors from all over the world.",views of the americas,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

There are still places in the USA where you can drive for many miles and see no trace of civilization. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, you can rent horses and pack mules and ride for days in unspoiled wilderness without seeing another person.

Some of them exist nowhere else in the world. The rainforest is a very important place. It helps control the world's climate by absorbing gases in the air that can cause a problem called global warming. It also provides a home for the many animals in the area.

Later, we took a bus back to where we were staying. I roomed with three people, and our room was connected to a room with three more boys and one of my friends' dad. That night people were sick. It was from riding Everest.
On the fourth day we went to MGM, and they closed a section of the roller coaster just for the eighth graders. They closed down that part of the park for us and that was the most fun.

""George,"" said his father, ""do you know who has killed my beautiful little cherry tree yonder in the garden? I would not have taken five guineas for it!""
This was a hard question to answer, and for a moment George was staggered by it, but quickly recovering himself he cried:— ""I cannot tell a lie, father, you know I cannot tell a lie! I did cut it with my little hatchet.""
The anger died out of his father's face, and taking the boy tenderly in his arms, he said:— ""My son, that you should not be afraid, to tell the truth, is more to me than a thousand trees! yes, though they were blossomed with silver and had leaves of the purest gold!""",stories for great holidays,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2820,"One fine morning in the autumn Mr. Washington, taking little George by the hand, walked with him to the apple orchard, promising that he would show him a fine sight.
On arriving at the orchard they saw a fine sight, indeed! The green grass under the trees was strewn with red-cheeked apples, and yet the trees were bending under the weight of fruit that hung thick among the leaves.
""Now, George,"" said his father, ""look, my son, see all this rich harvest of fruit! Do you remember when your good cousin brought you a fine, large apple last spring, how you refused to divide it with your brothers? And yet I told you then that, if you would be generous, God would give you plenty of apples this autumn.""",stories for great holidays,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2821,"Poor George could not answer, but hanging down his head looked quite confused, while with his little, naked, bare feet he scratched in the soft ground.
""Now, look up, my son,"" continued his father, ""and see how the blessed God has richly provided us with these trees loaded with the finest fruit. See how abundant is the harvest. Some of the trees are bending beneath their burdens, while the ground is covered with mellow apples, more than you could eat, my son, in all your lifetime.""
George looked in silence on the orchard, he marked the busy, humming bees, and heard the gay notes of the birds fluttering from tree to tree. His eyes filled with tears and he answered softly:— ""Truly, father, I never will be selfish anymore.""",stories for great holidays,3,Intermediate,2,-1

These people are written about in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That book ends like this: Tom and I find money that was stolen and we are allowed to keep it. We become rich. We each have 6,000 dollars in gold. Judge Thatcher put the money in a bank for us, and we can have a dollar a day. That is more money than a person can know how to spend.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

Me­yow!"" outside my window. I answered, ""Me­yow! Me­yow!"" as quietly as I could. Then I climbed out of my window onto the porch roof. From the roof I jumped to the ground and walked slowly among the trees. There was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
Tom and I walked quietly along a path among the trees. When we passed near the widow's kitchen, I fell and made a noise. We lay very still. Miss Watson's black slave, Jim, was sitting in the kitchen door. We could see him clearly because there was a light behind him. He stood up and asked, ""Who's there?""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

I'll just sit here until I hear the noise again."" Jim sat on the ground between Tom and me. He leaned against the tree we were hiding behind. He almost touched my leg. My nose began to feel uncomfortable and I wanted to rub it, but I dared not. We sat quietly for a long time. Then Jim began to breathe heavily and we knew that he was asleep. Very quietly, Tom and I stood up and walked away.
Then Tom decided that we would need some candles. He also wanted to play a trick on Jim. I didn't like it but Tom loved jokes.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1
2846,"Tom and I walked quickly into town where we could see only three or four lights. Almost everyone was asleep. Near the town was a big river, a mile wide, and very quiet at this time of night. Near the river we found Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and two or three other boys hiding. We climbed into a small boat and traveled two and a half miles down the river before we stopped the boat and went ashore.
Tom led us to some bushes where he made everyone promise to keep his secret. He pushed aside the bushes and showed us a hole in the hill. We lit our candles and used them to light our way through the hole and into a large cave. Soon we came to a kind of underground room where we stopped. Tom said, ""Now we'll start our club and call it Tom Sawyer's Club.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2847,"Tom wrote the program of his club on a sheet of paper and read it to us. All the boys had to promise that they would never tell any of the club's secrets. If they did, other members of the club would kill them and would burn their dead bodies. Some boys thought that it would be a good idea to also kill the families of the boys who told club secrets. Tom added this to the promise.
Then Ben Rogers said, ""Huck Finn doesn't have a family. How can we let him join the club?"" ""Well, he has a father,"" said Tom Sawyer.
""Yes, he has a father, but you can never find him. The boys talked about this problem. They decided that I could not join their club. I became very sad and felt like crying. Then I thought of a solution to my problem. ""Miss Watson can be part of my family.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2
2849,"One morning, while I was eating breakfast, I poured some salt on the table. It was an accident. I knew that it was bad luck to acci­dentally pour salt and that the only way to get rid of the bad luck was to throw some salt over my left shoulder. But Miss Watson stopped my hand and shouted, ""Take your hands away from that salt, Huckleberry. You've already made the table dirty. Don't make it dirtier."" I knew that I couldn't stop the bad luck; it would follow me always. I quickly left the table and ran out of the house. I was worried and frightened. I knew that something bad was going to happen to me, but I didn't know where or when it would happen.
I walked through the front garden and climbed over a high fence. Snow was on the ground, and I could see tracks made by a man's shoes in the snow.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

""Hello, Huckleberry, why have you been running? Did you come to ask me about your money? Do you need a few dollars?"" ""No, sir,"" I answered. ""Did the bank send you some money for me?""
""Yes, more than 150 dollars. That's a large amount of money. I would like to keep it for you, together with your 6,000 dollars. If I give you all the money now, you'll only spend it on foolish things."" ""I don't want to spend my money. I don't even want it ever. Not even the 6,000 dollars. I want you to have it. I want to give all my money to you.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

I told him that I knew that Pap was in town again because I knew that he had made a cross with two nails in the heel of his left shoe. I wanted to know what Pap was planning to do. Would he stay in St. Petersburg a long time?
Jim took his hair ball and said some words over it. Then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. The hair ball rolled a short distance. Jim did this several times, but the hair ball acted the same each time. Jim put his ear against it and listened, but he heard nothing. He said that the hair ball would not talk unless I gave him some money. I gave Jim twenty-­five cents, and he put the money under the hair ball.

But I continued to go to school, and tried to prevent Pap from seeing me. I wasn't happy going to school before, but now I went because I knew that it made Pap unhappy. Some days I would ask Judge Thatcher for two or three dollars, which I gave to Pap. He would buy whiskey with the money and get very drunk and start fights with men in town.
Pap began coming to the widow's house to see me. She told him to stay away or she would cause trouble for him. This made him very angry. He told her that he had authority over his son and she couldn't tell him how he must act around his son, what he could and could not do to me.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

When he was away for long periods of time, I began to worry that he would never return. What would happen to me? I could die locked inside the cabin. I began to think of a way to escape. I found an old dirty saw that Pap didn't know was in the cabin. With this tool, I began to saw a hole through one of the logs in the wall behind my bed. I wanted to make a hole large enough to climb through and escape. Making such a hole was going to take a long time, and I worked at it whenever Pap was out of the cabin. I kept the saw hidden while Pap was home. When Pap would leave, I pushed the bed away from the wall and sawed at the log.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2,-1

I knew that Pap had forgotten all that had occurred the night before.
I answered, ""Someone tried to get into the cabin last night. I took the gun to protect us."" ""You should have awakened me."" ""I tried. I really tried. I shook you, but you continued to sleep."" ""Don't stand there talking all day. Go to the river to catch some fish for breakfast. I'm hungry."" Pap unlocked the door, and I walked along the river until I found a good place to fish. I noticed many branches floating on the river. The river was much deeper than it was normally and was flowing much faster. Several large logs floated down the river.

There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out.

""And I know you meant to be kind,"" she said, relenting, ""so you may give me a kiss.""
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses.
""I thought you would want it back,"" he said a little bitterly, and offered to return her the thimble.

""To tell the other boys.""
""Don't go Peter,"" she entreated, ""I know such lots of stories.""
Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him.
He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her, but did not.
""Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!"" she cried, and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.
""Let me go!"" she ordered him.

John rubbed his eyes. ""Then I shall get up,"" he said. Of course he was on the floor already.
""Hello,"" he said, ""I am up!""
Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong.

""How topping!"" said John and Michael.
""How sweet!"" cried Wendy.
""Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!"" said Peter, forgetting his manners again.
It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
""I say, how do you do it?"" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a practical boy.

He was very sorry.
""I say, Wendy,"" he whispered to her, ""always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.""
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security.

""Hullo,"" replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.
""Is Wendy asleep?"" they asked.

""Great,"" they all cried and became happy.
""Very well,"" she said, ""I will do my best. Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.""
In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watching outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl.",peter pan part 4,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could just feel stodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.",peter pan part 4,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found something; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could find nothing. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.",peter pan part 4,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

""People of our figure, Wendy!""
""But it is only among our own children.""
""True, true.""
So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.

She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.
""Dear Peter,"" she said, ""with such a large family, of course, I have now passed my best, but you don't want to change me, do you?""
""No, Wendy.""
Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably, blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.
""Peter, what is it?""
""I was just thinking,"" he said, a little scared.
""It is only make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father?""

Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story!
And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he left the room. But tonight he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.",peter pan part 5,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

""Long ago,"" he said, ""I thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.""
I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared them.
""Wendy, let's go home,"" cried John and Michael together.
""Yes,"" she said, clutching them.

""Mother!"" Wendy cried.
""That's Wendy,"" she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.
""Mother!""
""That's John,"" she said.
""Mother!"" cried Michael. He knew her now.
""That's Michael,"" she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.

Also, avoid stressing about money. Yes, it can get very expensive in England, or in any country where you aren't familiar with secret ways to save money, but if you spend your entire study abroad converting currencies in your head you may have a minor breakdown.

If you're not inclined to taking photos, memorialize your trip in another way, like keep a journal or start a blog.

""Want to stop at the Casino Restaurant, lady? Have something to eat? Listen to the music? Everyone stops."" ""I think that would be nice,"" said the fare.
They made a sudden stop at the door of the restaurant. The cab door opened. The fare stepped out. At once she seemed caught by the wonderful music. The lights and the colors were bright, almost blinding. Someone put a piece of paper into her hand. On it was a number—34.
She looked around and saw her cab. It was twenty yards away, taking its place in a line with other waiting cabs.

At fifty tables sat people who looked to her like kings and queens. She thought their clothes and jewels were wonderfully rich. And now and then one of these people would look at her. They saw a small woman in a simple dress. They saw a plain face. But on that face they saw an expression of love of life, and the queens wished that they could look the same.

A waiter told her that it was for her cab. He said that she should go to the door and give it to the man there. This man took it and called the number. Only three cabs stood in line now. The driver of one of them went and found Jerry asleep inside his cab.
Jerry spoke a few words in anger, and then went up to his seat. He turned the horse and the cab rolled to the door and stopped. His fare entered.

""I want to see four dollars before going any farther. Have you got the money?"" ""Four dollars!"" laughed the fare, softly. ""No. I've only got a few cents with me."" Jerry made the horse run. The animal's feet were very loud on the street. But above the noise of the horse's feet, Jerry's voice could be heard. He was full of anger. He shouted at the stars in the sky. He shouted at other cabs as they passed. His words were so bad that another driver, hearing them, could not believe his ears.",o'henry part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-1

Most of the Adams family went to the bank together that morning. There were Mr. Adams, Annabel, Jimmy, and Annabel's married sister with her two little girls, aged five and nine. They passed Jimmy's hotel, and Jimmy ran up to his room and brought along his bag. Then they went to the bank.

In the moments that passed then, he could feel the quick breath of true adventure. What might not be behind the wood of that green door! Bad men planning bad acts, or beauty in trouble, or death, or love—anything might be there.

This part of the city is called Greenwich Village. And to old Greenwich Village the painters soon came. Here they found rooms they like, with good light and at a low cost.
Sue and Johnsy lived at the top of a building with three floors. One of these young women came from Maine, the other from California. They had met at a restaurant on Eighth Street.

One evening a young man appeared, going from one to another of these big old houses, ringing the doorbell. At the twelfth house, he put down the bag he carried. He cleaned the dust from his face.

But the cop's mind would not consider Soapy. Men who break windows do not stop there to talk to cops. They run away as fast as they can. The cop saw a man further along the street, running.

He went near her. He could see that the cop was already watching him. The young woman moved away a few steps. Soapy followed. Standing beside her he said: ""Good evening, Bedelia!

He has always, however, been a prime favorite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him.

She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else.

""We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.""
""My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.""
""Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favorite.

Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?""
""He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger to the district.

Steve Long is a plant biologist with the University of Illinois. ""Arguably, photosynthesis is the most important process on our planet. It is the driving force behind all of life.""

When you listen back to the recording, you can get valuable information about how you sound when you speak. You can share the videos with friends or your teachers. They can give you advice, too.

It's served as a solemn reminder of that great tragedy that changed the face of London forever. One thing that many people aren't aware of is that you actually climb to the top of the monument and there is a spectacular viewing platform that provides amazing views of the city.

Remember that a heartfelt thank you, and a firm handshake is a great tip in itself for someone who is proud of what they do. A tip is nice, too, but without the smile it can come across as arrogant, patronising, snooty or crass.
Don't worry about tipping all the time; in Britain, we simply don't. People who receive tips are flattered by them and for the lowly-paid it is a tremendous help to make ends meet. But if you don't tip, they won't put your name on some British hotel blacklist or broadcast the fact on Twitter! Enjoy your holiday. Enjoy meeting people. Enjoy being pampered.

This means that there is automatically a 2.5% discount on pretty much everything.
With the lowering exchange rates, increased competitiveness on transatlantic airfares and the desperation of business to keep customers during this economic downturn, now is definitely the time to book a trip to London and the rest of the UK.

Its rivers, moors, and forests are also big draws to the park as well as the many markets, walks, and activities provided by the National Trust and other groups.

Nowadays the winter weather is wet and windy rather than icy and snowy in the south. This is a shame really as the latter certainly makes us feel more festive as we approach Christmas. Our unpredictable weather is due to the moist air from the Atlantic to the south and west mixing with the dry continental air from mainland Europe to the east; with a bit of global warming added in.

We often ask our neighbours if they can put them in the field opposite more often to complete the quintessentially English view with the cows munching away on the grass in the foreground and the South Downs in the distance. The farmer separates them from their mothers at quite a young age so they can control the amount of milk they drink.

Also, the stream by the old corn mill is completely dry and what is usually a rushing stream with wild garlic growing in the spring time, is now a gully full of dry leaves.

You can get there in many different ways across the Solent (the stretch of water between the mainland and the island); by hovercraft, ferry or catamaran.

The river Ouse, the river Adur and their tributaries are constantly under pressure from pollution and assessing the invertebrate population is an excellent way of knowing the status of a watercourse.

One of the first signs of spring for me is when the swallows come back from their travels to Africa and spend the warmer months in the British Isles. They swoop low over the lake snapping flies out of the air, then go and chatter to each other on the telegraph lines or on the beams in the barns. I recently took a photo of some fledgling swallows I saw doing just this.

The asparagus grows in early to mid-spring, and looks like fingers growing out of the ground. It almost grows while you watch. You can pick it all and then the next day, it's back!

It wasn't up to hurricane standards, but wind speeds reached 80 mph and even more on the south coast. Last Easter we had 'Storm Katie' which was much fiercer than Angus and it blew the kids' trampoline away down as far as the vegetable patch; how rude! It narrowly missed taking out one of the greenhouses and the power lines in between; we counted ourselves lucky there. It was beyond fixing, so we had to buy another trampoline, this time we've staked it down with croquet hoops, just in case!",notes from an english farm,4,Upper-Intermediate,3,-1

Each year in early September they hold an annual Harvest Fair with ploughing matches, a local folk band, a barbecue, sheep shearing, local craft stalls and a display of vintage tractors and stationary engines. We have attended the fair for a couple of years now and we enjoy showing our support as well as having the opportunity to see some farming machinery (which our sons love) and meeting friends.
This year we decided to take our tractor to the show, as it's a very fine example, to show it off. Once at the fair, we got chatting to a chap who is writing a book about vintage tractors and he was very enthusiastic about ours.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2,-2

There used to be a second pier called the West Pier, but this has been so battered by the sea and outbreaks of fire, it's now a ghostly metal shell cut off from the shore. Here's a photo of the remains of the West Pier which is a bit further along the beach to the west. Brighton also has a lot of history, and you can get a multitude of town tours to experience all the interesting places it has to offer.

We are positively drowning in peas, courgettes, runner beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and raspberries. It's lovely to pick the crop and then be eating it half an hour later; you can't get much fresher than that! It's a great way to get healthy vitamin-packed food into the kids as they love to help pick and prepare it. They also understand where it all comes from rather than just from a supermarket shelf.
The apples in the orchards are growing well too, although it'll still be a month or so before we can pick them to make into cider.

We've recently had Halloween; something we don't celebrate quite so much here as is done in other countries. In addition to this, we live in the middle of nowhere, there's no street lighting and we only have one neighbour, so we didn't 'Trick or Treat'. We did have some pumpkins and we had great fun with the kids hollowing them out to make spooky lanterns with tea lights in.

Then I needed a table and a chair, and that was my next job. I had to work on them for a long time. I also wanted to make places to put all my food, and all my tools and guns. But every time I wanted a piece of wood, I had to cut down a tree. It was long, slow, difficult work, and during the next months I learnt to be very clever with my tools. There was no hurry.

Sue and Johnsy lived at the top of a building with three floors. One of these young women came from Maine, the other from California. They had met at a restaurant on Eighth Street.

But did you know that we actually see the sky through a 300-mile thick gaseous layer? This is the earth's atmosphere that makes up the air we breathe. In fact, this thin layer of gas protects us from the sun's rays. What's more this gaseous layer makes the sky blue as its molecules only absorb one color, blue, which gets scattered around the sky. However, when the sky turns red during a sunset, it means we're further away from the sun. The sun's light must pass through a denser atmospheric layer and blue light is too far away to make the distance. Only the color red filters through atmosphere. Nevertheless, keep enjoying the sky's view no matter of what it is composed of.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Much like the way we organize our belongings the brain categorizes all the information it receives by sorting similar things together, for example shirts with shirts. The reason the brain works in this way so we can retain information better. If we put socks in a pot in the kitchen or stored them in a fridge, there would probably be something seriously wrong with the brain. That's how disorder starts. Parents tend to relate a messy room to a messy brain. Unless a child keeps a room in order he or she is unlikely to perform well at school. Parents have a point there. Putting things away creates a system, which leads to better organization in life.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1

Nowadays, although we change them far less often, it is considered polite to eat dessert from a different plate than the one we use for our starter or main course. Strangely enough, dessert plates are so small that sometimes there's barely enough room to fit three scoops of chocolate ice cream. Soup and similar dishes provide us with nourishment, so they come first to stuff ourselves and stop feeling hungry. Whereas dessert is a pleasure and the size of the dessert plate is in fact directly proportional to appetite.

As for the night it was Egyptian astronomers who noted that the stars rose in the east and set in the west. They noticed that one of these stars, the North Star, didn't move and other stars rotated around it. They chose it to be a point of reference. They divided up the sky into 36 sequences. When observing the summer sky, Egyptian astronomers noted that only twelve sequences of the sky crossed the North Star. So, they assigned each of these equal sequences one hour, or twelve hours for the whole night. Then they figured that the day would be no different and allocated twelve hours for the daytime as well. A day of 24 hours was born.",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1,-2

Yet it's taken century to figure out that it's not enough to attach wings to our back and fly like a bird. When an airplane first accelerates, the air around the plane's wings is divided into two parts, moving at two different speeds. As the wings are slightly curved on top, air is passing over the wing, pushed upwards, and the area of low pressure is created. Meanwhile, the opposite action is taken underneath. Air passing under the wing thrusts downwards, exerting higher pressure on the wing, which creates lift. All this helps push the airplane to sky. In other words, air contains elements of force so that a plane can take off and maintain its altitude.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2,-1

As for her health improvement, she is not completely over she feels much better though. The pool is open even if the temperature drops below zero and the water gets frozen.
