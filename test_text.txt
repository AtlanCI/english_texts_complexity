The first day in this new, cold country was very bad for Buck. He was a strong dog, but there were a lot of dangerous men and dogs everywhere. Buck had to be careful and he had to learn quickly.
These dogs and men were wild, and they followed the law of the club.
Buck's first new lesson, in this cold place, came quickly. Both dogs, Buck and Curly, stood near a store, in one of the camps.
A new dog walked past them. Curly wanted to be friendly, so she barked quietly.
Suddenly, the other dog turned around and attacked her. Curly was very angry, so she jumped at this strange, unfriendly dog. But the dog attacked her again and jumped away quickly.
Suddenly, he pushed Curly over and she fell on the ground. She couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again.
