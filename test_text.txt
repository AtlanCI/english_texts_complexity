Cardiovascular disease is the world’s leading cause of death.  It includes heart attack, stroke and high blood pressure.

 Over the years, researchers have identified several substances in the blood that can serve as what they call cardiac biomarkers.  These are used to measure the presence and development of cardiovascular disease.

 Researchers have increasingly tried to use these biomarkers to identify people who are at high risk of developing heart disease.  But a new study has found that they offer little help in this way.

 A team from Massachusetts General Hospital and Sweden’s Lund University studied how effective the biomarkers are as predictors.  Thomas Wang at the Mass General Heart Center was the senior author of the study.

 Doctor Wang said that even after measuring those additional biomarkers they were not able to fully understand who was more likely to develop heart disease”

 Doctor Wang says they did identify some combinations of biomarkers that improved predictions of heart attacks and strokes.  He said it is possible that in certain patients, measuring these biomarkers would be helpful.  But for majority of patients, having the information of biomarker probably would not make a difference. 

 Doctor Wang hopes future research will discover biomarkers that are better able to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease.  But for now, he says, doctor should depend on traditional risk factors.  These include a history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, tobacco use, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity or poor nutrition.

 A separate study found no support for a theory that a biomarker called C-reactive protein causes heart disease.  Earlier research suggested that the more of the protein in people’s blood, the more likely they are to develop heart disease.  The new study confirmed a link, but did not find evidence that the C-reactive protein causes the disease.

 Both studies appeared in the July first issue of Journal of the American Medical Association.

 The World Health Organization estimates that cardiovascular disease killed seventeen and a half million people in two thousand five.  That was thirty percent of all deaths.  Eight out of ten happened in low and middle income countries.  At current growth rates, the W.H.O. expects the number to reach twenty million by two thousand fifteen. 182 LEVEL CALCULATED AS Upper-Intermediate

It is a familiar story.  A major athlete fails a drug test or evidence surfaces about steroid use.

 Former Olympian Marion Jones.  Tour de France winner Floyd Landis.  Some of baseball’s greatest players.  In February, the New York Yankees’ Alex Rodriquez confessed on ESPN television to past steroid use.

 “I did take a banned substance,” he said.  “And for that I’m very sorry.  And deeply regretful.”

 Dr. Michael Irwig is an endocrinologist at George Washington University, “Most of the patients that I’ve seen have been recreational athletes or personal trainers in gyms,” he said.

 Dr. Irwig says because the drugs are illegal, it is impossible to say how many people use them and what damage long term use might cause.

 “There really aren’t any great studies that have been done on the long term effects of steroids.  So we really don’t know until we have the studies,” he added.

 Abuse of steroids can have negative impact on health

 What is known, steroids can make users more vulnerable to heart attack and stroke.

 And a new study suggests users can become dependent on these drugs.

 Thirty percent of male weight lifters who participated in a Harvard affiliated study - and admitted to steroids use - reported becoming addicted.

 The researchers found steroids can be as difficult to quit as other types of habit forming drugs, even though, unlike cocaine and other addictive substances, steroids do not produce a “high” (a feeling of euphoria).

 Dr. Irwig says young people use steroids not just to improve athletic performance.

 “I’ve also noticed in our society that there’s a really large focus on body image,” he said, “and I think that’s why a lot of young people are using steroids.”

 Researchers say there should be more studies on who is likely to become addicted and how to help treat those who are. 188 LEVEL CALCULATED AS Upper-Intermediate

Larry Bulanadi is known in the Philippines as  Cobra King, because of his skill in hunting the feared spitting cobra - a highly venomous snake that spits toxin at its prey.

 Farmers in this area have asked him to rid their farms of cobras.

 Today Bulanadi was called by this farmer who found two snakes in his field.  If he gets bitten by a cobra, he could die quickly.  Hospitals are far away and often they do not even have antivenin.

 “There is a good chance to find snakes here because the field has been cleared of places they could hide.  Farm owners ask us to clear the field of snakes because it is a risk to their lives.”

 The World Health Organization says about five million people around the world are bitten by snakes each year.  As many as 200-thousand die, and about 400-thousand lose limbs.  Most victims are in developing countries in Africa and Asia.

 The WHO says victims in developing countries, many of them children, die because they are far from medical help and because there is a global scarcity of antivenin.

 Toxicology and Research in Bangkok.  He says the high cost of producing antivenin means poorer countries such as Cambodia and Burma cannot get adequate supplies.

 Unlike other medicines that can be mass produced, Dr. Visith says antivenin is often tailor-made for snakes from specific locations.

 “Although they may share the common toxin component, but the biological effect varies, you know depending on the environment, genetics and the food they eat.”

 That means antivenin for a spitting cobra in the Philippines may not work on someone bitten by a similar snake in West Africa.

 In this snake farm in Bangkok, children are introduced to a variety of snakes.  They learn that most snakes bite people only by accident, and they learn ways to avoid bites - such as wearing rubber boots.

 For now, experts say the best ways to reduce the death and injury toll from snake bites are prevention and education. 190 LEVEL CALCULATED AS Upper-Intermediate

Margaret Rupli Woodward was in Holland in 1940, working for the NBC radio network.  She was its first woman correspondent.  She went on shortwave radio live, telling an American audience what was happening in Holland, just months before Nazi Germany invaded the country.

 “This is Margaret Rupli speaking from Holland,” Woodward announced.  “The Dutch are anxiously watching spring developments in Europe for Holland has suffered almost as much in the war between the allies in Germany as the beligerants themselves.”

 Woodward was not a journalist when she was hired, but she was well educated and knew several languages.  She was in Amsterdam with her husband, David Woodward, a British newspaper reporter.  Now, at 99 years old, she remembers how lucky she was.

 “They wanted an American voice, and I’ve got an American voice.  They wanted somebody whose voice projected and mine does,” she said.  “And I think basically, they couldn’t find a man and I was available.”

 In Amsterdam, she met Edward R. Morrow, an American broadcaster famous for his reporting on the war.

 Murrow worked for CBS.  He had hired photographer Mary Marvin Breckinridge as the network’s first female correspondent.  She broadcast from various locations in Europe.  Even though Woodward worked for a rival network, Murrow gave her advice on how to write stories.

 “Use understatement on everything you do,” Woodward recalled.  “It was good advice.”

 Woodward says NBC let her write whatever she wanted, but Dutch military censors had to approve her scripts.  Her memories come back as she reads a story from March 10, 1940.

 “All foreign planes will be forbidden to land at the Amsterdam airport after tomorrow and everywhere in front of the government buildings, newspaper offices and other key points there has been a guard on sentry,” she read.

 Germany invaded the country two months later.  On the first day of the attack, a bomb exploded outside the building where Woodward did her broadcasts.  She had hoped to air the story but was not able to get through.  As Germany occupied Holland, it became too dangerous to stay.  She and and her husband fled to England on a coal barge.

 “I just turned off the chicken that was on the stove and left with a couple of pairs of socks for David, couple of toothbrushes for us, and what we had on,” she said.

 In London, Woodward reported her escape from Holland.  It was one of the last broadcasts she did.  She was a highly-praised reporter for six months.  She left London, returned to the United States and asked NBC for a full-time reporting job.

 “They just laughed at me,” Woodward recalls.  “I went down to the NBC studios and I said, ‘Look, can you hire me?’  and they said no.”

 After World War II, none of the four other American women correspondents were heard on the air again.  And those who tried couldn’t find other jobs in broadcasting.  194 LEVEL CALCULATED AS Upper-Intermediate

Pisistratus was fast asleep,
but Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy
 father, so Minerva went close up to him and said: 

"Telemachus, you should not remain so far away from home any longer,
nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house;
 they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have
 been on a fool's errand.  Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if
 you wish to find your excellent mother still there when you get back.
 Her father and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,
who has given her more than any of the others, and has been greatly
 increasing his wedding presents.  I hope nothing valuable may have
 been taken from the house in spite of you, but you know what women
 are- they always want to do the best they can for the man who marries
 them, and never give another thought to the children of their first
 husband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with.
 Go home, therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable
 woman servant that you have, until it shall please heaven to send
 you a wife of your own.  Let me tell you also of another matter which
 you had better attend to.  The chief men among the suitors are lying
 in wait for you in the Strait between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean
 to kill you before you can reach home.  I do not much think they will
 succeed;  it is more likely that some of those who are now eating up
 your property will find a grave themselves.  Sail night and day, and
 keep your ship well away from the islands;  the god who watches over
 you and protects you will send you a fair wind.  As soon as you get
 to Ithaca send your ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight
 to the swineherd who has charge your pigs;  he is well disposed towards
 you, stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to
 Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from Pylos."

 Then she went back to Olympus;  but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus
 with his heel to rouse him, and said, "Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke
 the horses to the chariot, for we must set off home." 

 But Pisistratus said, "No matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive
 in the dark.  It will be morning soon;  wait till Menelaus has brought
 his presents and put them in the chariot for us;  and let him say good-bye
 to us in the usual way.  So long as he lives a guest should never forget
 a host who has shown him kindness." 

 As he spoke day began to break, and Menelaus, who had already risen,
leaving Helen in bed, came towards them.  When Telemachus saw him he
 put on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his
 shoulders, and went out to meet him.  "Menelaus," said he, "let me
 go back now to my own country, for I want to get home." 

 And Menelaus answered, "Telemachus, if you insist on going I will
 not detain you.  not like to see a host either too fond of his guest
 or too rude to him.  Moderation is best in all things, and not letting
 a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if
 he would like to stay.  One should treat a guest well as long as he
 is in the house and speed him when he wants to leave it.  Wait, then,
till I can get your beautiful presents into your chariot, and till
 you have yourself seen them.  I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient
 dinner for you of what there may be in the house;  it will be at once
 more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting
 out on such a long journey.  If, moreover, you have a fancy for making
 a tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and
 will conduct you myself through all our principal cities.  No one will
 send us away empty handed;  every one will give us something- a bronze
 tripod, a couple of mules, or a gold cup." 

 "Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "I want to go home at once, for when
 I came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while
 looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself, or find that something
 valuable has been stolen during my absence." 

 When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants
 to prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house.
 At this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had
 just got up;  so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some
 meat, which he at once did.  Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant
 store room, not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes.  When
 he reached the place where the treasures of his house were kept, he
 selected a double cup, and told his son Megapenthes to bring also
 a silver mixing-bowl.  Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she
 kept the lovely dresses which she had made with her own hands, and
 took out one that was largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery;
 it glittered like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest.
 Then they all came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,
and Menelaus said, "Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno,
bring you safely home according to your desire.  I will now present
 you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house.
 It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid
 with gold, and it is the work of Vulcan.  Phaedimus king of the Sidonians
 made me a present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while
 I was on my return home.  I should like to give it to you."

 With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,
while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before
 him.  Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.

 "I too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake from
 the hand of Helen;  it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.
 Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you;  thus may you go
 back rejoicing to your own country and to your home." 

 So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly.
 Then Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot, and admired them
 all as he did so.  Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus
 into the house, and they both of them sat down to table.  A maid servant
 brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into
 a silver basin for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean
 table beside them;  an upper servant brought them bread and offered
 them many good things of what there was in the house.  Eteoneus carved
 the meat and gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured
 out the wine.  Then they laid their hands upon the good things that
 were before them, but as soon as they had had had enough to eat and
 drink Telemachus and Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their
 places in the chariot.  They drove out through the inner gateway and
 under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came
 after them with a golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they
 might make a drink-offering before they set out.  He stood in front
 of the horses and pledged them, saying, "Farewell to both of you;
 see that you tell Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind
 to me as any father could be while we Achaeans were fighting before
 Troy." 

 "We will be sure, sir," answered Telemachus, "to tell him everything
 as soon as we see him.  I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses
 returned when I get back to Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very
 great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents
 I am taking with me." 

 As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand- an eagle with
 a great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the
 farm yard- and all the men and women were running after it and shouting.
 It came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands
 in front of the horses.  When they saw it they were glad, and their
 hearts took comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, "Tell me,
Menelaus, has heaven sent this omen for us or for you?" 

 Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him
 to make, but Helen was too quick for him and said, "I will read this
 matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it
 will come to pass.  The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
 and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled
 far and suffered much, will return to take his revenge- if indeed
 he is not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."

 "May Jove so grant it," replied Telemachus;  "if it should prove to
 be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god, even when
 I am at home." 

 As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed
 through the town towards the open country.  They swayed the yoke upon
 their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and
 darkness was over all the land.  Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles
 lived who was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus.  There they passed
 the night and were treated hospitably.  When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their
 places in the chariot.  They drove out through the inner gateway and
 under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court.  Then Pisistratus lashed
 his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath;  ere long they came
 to Pylos, and then Telemachus said: 

"Pisistratus, I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask
 you.  You know our fathers were old friends before us;  moreover, we
 are both of an age, and this journey has brought us together still
 more closely;  do not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me
 there, for if I go to your father's house he will try to keep me in
 the warmth of his good will towards me, and I must go home at once."

 Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked, and in the end
 he deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's
 beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel.
 Then he said, "Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also
 before I can reach home to tell my father.  I know how obstinate he
 is, and am sure he will not let you go;  he will come down here to
 fetch you, and he will not go back without you.  But he will be very
 angry." 

 With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians
 and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together
 and gave his orders.  "Now, my men," said he, "get everything in order
 on board the ship, and let us set out home." 

 Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said.  But
 as Telemachus was thus busied, praying also and sacrificing to Minerva
 in the ship's stern, there came to him a man from a distant country,
a seer, who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man.  He
 was descended from Melampus, who used to live in Pylos, the land of
 sheep;  he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven into
 exile by the great and powerful king Neleus.  Neleus seized his goods
 and held them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner
 in the house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on
 account of the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a
 great sorrow that dread Erinyes had laid upon him.  In the end, however,
he escaped with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos,
avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of
 Neleus to his brother.  Then he left the country and went to Argos,
where it was ordained that he should reign over much people.  There
 he married, established himself, and had two famous sons Antiphates
 and Mantius.  Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus,
who was dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live
 to old age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts.
 His sons were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus.  Mantius, the other son of
 Melampus, was father to Polypheides and Cleitus.  Aurora, throned in
 gold, carried off Cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell
 among the immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer
 in the whole world now that Amphiaraus was dead.  He quarrelled with
 his father and went to live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied
 for all men. 

 His son, Theoclymenus, it was who now came up to Telemachus as he
 was making drink-offerings and praying in his ship.  "Friend'" said
 he, "now that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you
 by your sacrifices themselves, and by the god to whom you make them,
I pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell
 me the truth and nothing but the truth.  Who and whence are you?  Tell
 me also of your town and parents." 

 Telemachus said, "I will answer you quite truly.  I am from Ithaca,
and my father is 'Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived.  But he
 has come to some miserable end.  Therefore I have taken this ship and
 got my crew together to see if I can hear any news of him, for he
 has been away a long time." 

 "I too," answered Theoclymenus, am an exile, for I have killed a man
 of my own race.  He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they
 have great power among the Argives.  I am flying to escape death at
 their hands, and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the
 earth.  I am your suppliant;  take me, therefore, on board your ship
 that they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."

 "I will not refuse you," replied Telemachus, "if you wish to join
 us.  Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according
 to what we have." 

 On this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deck
 of the ship.  He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus
 sit beside him;  then the men let go the hawsers.  Telemachus told them
 to catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so.  They
 set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made
 it fast with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with
 sheets of twisted ox hide.  Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew
 fresh and strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible.
 Thus then they passed by Crouni and Chalcis. 

 Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land.  The vessel
 made a quick pass sage to Pheae and thence on to Elis, where the Epeans
 rule.  Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands, wondering
 within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.

 Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the
 hut, and the men supped with them.  As soon as they had had to eat
 and drink, Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether
 he would continue to treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the
 station or pack him off to the city;  so he said: 

"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging
 about the town, so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men.
 Give me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide to go
 with me and show me the way.  I will go the round of the city begging
 as I needs must, to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece
 of bread.  I should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring
 news of her husband to queen Penelope.  I could then go about among
 the suitors and see if out of all their abundance they will give me
 a dinner.  I should soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts
 of ways.  Listen and believe when I tell you that by the blessing of
 Mercury who gives grace and good name to the works of all men, there
 is no one living who would make a more handy servant than I should-
 to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine,
and do all those services that poor men have to do for their betters."

 The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this.  "Heaven
 help me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as that
 into your head?  If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a
 certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens.  They
 would never think of taking a man like you for a servant.  Their servants
 are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with
 well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept
 quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine.  Stay where
 you are, then;  you are not in anybody's way;  I do not mind your being
 here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemachus comes home
 he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
 want to go." 

 Ulysses answered, "I hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are
 to me, for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;
 there is nothing worse than being always ways on the tramp;  still,
when men have once got low down in the world they will go through
 a great deal on behalf of their miserable bellies.  Since however you
 press me to stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell about
 Ulysses' mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old
 age when he set out for Troy.  Are they still living or are they already
 dead and in the house of Hades?" 

 "I will tell you all about them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is still
 living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully his own house,
for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also
 about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him
 more than anything else did.  She came to an unhappy end through sorrow
 for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by me
 come to such an end as she did.  As long as she was still living, though
 she was always grieving, I used to like seeing her and asking her
 how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,
the youngest of her children;  we were boy and girl together, and she
 made little difference between us.  When, however, we both grew up,
they sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her.  As
 for me, my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of
 sandals for my feet, and sent me off into the country, but she was
 just as fond of me as ever.  This is all over now.  Still it has pleased
 heaven to prosper my work in the situation which I now hold.  I have
 enough to eat and drink, and can find something for any respectable
 stranger who comes here;  but there is no getting a kind word or deed
 out of my mistress, for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked
 people.  Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk
 with her;  they like to have something to eat and drink at the house,
and something too to take back with them into the country.  This is
 what will keep servants in a good humour." 

 Ulysses answered, "Then you must have been a very little fellow, Eumaeus,
when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.  Tell me,
and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother lived
 sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you were
 alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for
 whatever your master gave them?" 

 "Stranger," replied Eumaeus, "as regards your question: sit still,
make yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen to me.  The
 nights are now at their longest;  there is plenty of time both for
 sleeping and sitting up talking together;  you ought not to go to bed
 till bed time, too much sleep is as bad as too little;  if any one
 of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do so;  he can
 then take my master's pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning.
 We two will sit here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one
 another stories about our misfortunes;  for when a man has suffered
 much, and been buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling
 the memory of sorrows that have long gone by.  As regards your question,
then, my tale is as follows: 

"You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above
 Ortygia, where the land begins to turn round and look in another direction.
 It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture
 fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat.  Dearth
 never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any sickness, but
 when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them with his
 painless shafts.  It contains two communities, and the whole country
 is divided between these two.  My father Ctesius son of Ormenus, a
 man comparable to the gods, reigned over both. 

 "Now to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia
 (for the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had
 freighted with gewgaws of all kinds.  There happened to be a Phoenician
 woman in my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent
 servant;  these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing
 near their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman
 can resist, no matter how good she may be by nature.  The man who had
 seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from, and on
 this she told him her father's name.  ' I come from Sidon,' said she,
'and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth.  One day as I
 was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates seized
 me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the man who
 owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.' 

 "The man who had seduced her then said, 'Would you like to come along
 with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
 They are both alive and are said to be well off.' 

 "'I will do so gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear
 me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.'

 "They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their
 oath the woman said, 'Hush;  and if any of your men meets me in the
 street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one
 should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.
 He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered;  keep
 your own counsel therefore;  buy your merchandise as fast as you can,
and send me word when you have done loading.  I will bring as much
 gold as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else also that
 I can do towards paying my fare.  I am nurse to the son of the good
 man of the house, a funny little fellow just able to run about.  I
 will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of
 money for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.'

 "On this she went back to the house.  The Phoenicians stayed a whole
 year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,
and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to tell the
 woman.  Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's
 house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it;
 and while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring
 it and bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and
 then went back to the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led
 me out of the house.  In the fore part of the house she saw the tables
 set with the cups of guests who had been feasting with my father,
as being in attendance on him;  these were now all gone to a meeting
 of the public assembly, so she snatched up three cups and carried
 them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew
 no better.  The sun was now set, and darkness was over all the land,
so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the harbour,
where the Phoenician ship was lying.  When they had got on board they
 sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent
 then a fair wind;  six days did we sail both night and day, but on
 the seventh day Diana struck the woman and she fell heavily down into
 the ship's hold as though she were a sea gull alighting on the water;
 so they threw her overboard to the seals and fishes, and I was left
 all sorrowful and alone.  Presently the winds and waves took the ship
 to Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of his chattels for me, and thus
 it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this country." 

 Ulysses answered, "Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes
 with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good
 as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master,
who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink;  and you lead
 a good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city
 to city." 

 Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left
 for sleep, for it was soon daybreak.  In the meantime Telemachus and
 his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down the
 mast, and rowed the ship into the harbour.  They cast out their mooring
 stones and made fast the hawsers;  they then got out upon the sea shore,
mixed their wine, and got dinner ready.  As soon as they had had enough
 to eat and drink Telemachus said, "Take the ship on to the town, but
 leave me here, for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my
 farms.  In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down
 to the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will
 give you all a good dinner with meat and wine." 

 Then Theoclymenus said, 'And what, my dear young friend, is to become
 of me?  To whose house, among all your chief men, am I to repair?  or
 shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?"

 "At any other time," replied Telemachus, "I should have bidden you
 go to my own house, for you would find no want of hospitality;  at
 the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for
 I shall be away, and my mother will not see you;  she does not often
 show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in
 an upper chamber, out of their way;  but I can tell you a man whose
 house you can go to- I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, who is
 held in the highest estimation by every one in Ithaca.  He is much
 the best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying
 court to my mother and trying to take Ulysses' place.  Jove, however,
in heaven alone knows whether or no they will come to a bad end before
 the marriage takes place." 

 As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand- a hawk, Apollo's
 messenger.  It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore
 them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.
 On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
 "Telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right hand without
 having been sent there by some god.  As soon as I saw it I knew it
 was an omen;  it means that you will remain powerful and that there
 will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own." 

 "I wish it may prove so," answered Telemachus.  "If it does, I will
 show you so much good will and give you so many presents that all
 who meet you will congratulate you." 

 Then he said to his friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son of Clytius, you
 have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all
 those who have accompanied me to Pylos;  I wish you would take this
 stranger to your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can
 come for him." 

 And Piraeus answered, "Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you
 please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find no lack
 of hospitality." 

 As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others do so also and loose
 the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship.  But Telemachus
 bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head
 of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship.  Then they loosed the
 hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city
 but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you,
and in whose garden are you working?  Tell me also about another matter.
 Is this place that I have come to really Ithaca?  I met a man just
 now who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience
 to hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of
 mine, whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the
 house of Hades.  Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my
 house once when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger
 come to me whom I liked better.  He said that his family came from
 Ithaca and that his father was Laertes, son of Arceisius.  I received
 him hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house,
and when he went away I gave him all customary presents.  I gave him
 seven talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers
 chased upon it.  I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces
 of tapestry;  I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve
 rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts.  To all this
 I added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I
 let him take his choice." 

 His father shed tears and answered, "Sir, you have indeed come to
 the country that you have named, but it is fallen into the hands of
 wicked people.  All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose.
 If you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would
 have entertained you hospitably and would have required your presents
 amply when you left him- as would have been only right considering
 what you have already given him.  But tell me, and tell me true, how
 many years is it since you entertained this guest- my unhappy son,
as ever was?  Alas!  He has perished far from his own country;  the fishes
 of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a prey to the birds and
 wild beasts of some continent.  Neither his mother, nor I his father,
who were his parents, could throw our arms about him and wrap him
 in his shroud, nor could his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope
 bewail her husband as was natural upon his death bed, and close his
 eyes according to the offices due to the departed.  But now, tell me
 truly for I want to know.  Who and whence are you- tell me of your
 town and parents?  Where is the ship lying that has brought you and
 your men to Ithaca?  Or were you a passenger on some other man's ship,
and those who brought you here have gone on their way and left you?"

 "I will tell you everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly.  I come
 from Alybas, where I have a fine house.  I am son of king Apheidas,
who is the son of Polypemon.  My own name is Eperitus;  heaven drove
 me off my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried
 here against my will.  As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off
 the open country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since
 Ulysses left my country.  Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for
 him when he left me.  The birds all flew on our right hands, and both
 he and I rejoiced to see them as we parted, for we had every hope
 that we should have another friendly meeting and exchange presents."

 A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened.  He filled
 both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his
 grey head, groaning heavily as he did so.  The heart of Ulysses was
 touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father;  then
 he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying,
"I am he, father, about whom you are asking- I have returned after
 having been away for twenty years.  But cease your sighing and lamentation-
 we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing
 the suitors in my house, to punish them for their insolence and crimes."

 "If you really are my son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "and have come
 back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity
 as shall convince me." 

 "First observe this scar," answered Ulysses, "which I got from a boar's
 tusk when I was hunting on Mount Parnassus.  You and my mother had
 sent me to Autolycus, my mother's father, to receive the presents
 which when he was over here he had promised to give me.  Furthermore
 I will point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,
and I asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden.
 We went over them all, and you told me their names and what they all
 were.  You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty
 fig trees;  you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines;  there
 was corn planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every
 kind when the heat of heaven has been laid heavy upon them."

 Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
 his son had given him.  He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had
 to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;  but as soon
 as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses, he said, "O
 father Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the
 suitors have really been punished for their insolence and folly.  Nevertheless,
I am much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up
 here directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout
 the cities of the Cephallenians." 

 Ulysses answered, "Take heart and do not trouble yourself about that,
but let us go into the house hard by your garden.  I have already told
 Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner
 ready as soon as possible." 

 Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house.  When they
 got there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd
 cutting up meat and mixing wine with water.  Then the old Sicel woman
 took Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil.  She
 put him on a good cloak, and Minerva came up to him and gave him a
 more imposing presence, making him taller and stouter than before.
 When he came back his son was surprised to see him looking so like
 an immortal, and said to him, "My dear father, some one of the gods
 has been making you much taller and better-looking." 

 Laertes answered, "Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that
 I were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took
 Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland.  If I were still what
 I then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,
I should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.
 I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced
 to see it." 

 Thus did they converse;  but the others, when they had finished their
 work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his
 proper place on the benches and seats.  Then they began eating;  by
 and by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their
 mother, the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing
