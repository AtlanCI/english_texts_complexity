The talk certainly gave me plenty of food for thought about the way we communicate these days and how technology is changing our behaviour. People are constantly multitasking, whether it be emailing during meetings or texting in the checkout queue. I really believe it’s affecting the way we relate to each other and it’s not just in the workplace. Kids fade into the background as parents message at the dinner table or post on social networks during the school run. It’s as if we can’t bear to miss out on what our online buddies are up to, so we juggle the real and online world. My greatest concern is that we don’t give our brains a chance to switch off. It’s these precious moments when we actually process information that helps us make important decisions.

B
It was a fascinating talk and the speaker really hit the nail on the head with a couple of things. Take parental influence, for instance. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework when they witness their parents posting on social media while cooking the evening meal or waiting at a red light? She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations. I see it all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends. They arrange to meet and then sit together in silence while each one engages in a different conversation online.

C
So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there’s a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don’t think this is such an issue for my generation who’ve lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it’s OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They’re so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they’re learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.

D
I’m not sure to what extent I agree that people are more alone, but the way we communicate has certainly evolved. We send tiny snippets of conversation or emoticons to each other and I wonder how much this actually allows us to really understand one another. This superficial conversation is replacing in-depth face-to-face interaction with its pauses, intonation and sentiment. The speaker makes a good point about how we’re getting used to conversing with machines like Siri or robots, which are totally devoid of any experience of human life. But despite such limitations, we seem to be expecting more from technology and less from each other.

Advantage of communication on the internet is easy and share. when i sent a message to friend I use social media as soon as I can.Reason is most first and easiest way to communicate each other.Usage of Gmail is for service on the internet ,also I use Skype as well.however communicate on the internet has disadvantage.First of all,We don't spend time face-to-face conversation,in addition Someone don't like this way.eventually students are decreasing communication skill.as a result teenager don't talking each other.In fact I don't spend much time face-to-face conversation.
to sum up. we use social media to communicate widely whereas some people don't like communicate on the internet .

Well, I have to say this a very interesting topic because it talks about something (Communication) that concerns people in a very important aspect. It is true that Technology and its social medias have extremely changed our way to communicate, but in my opinion, this fact has its good things and its bad things at the same time, why? Let me be more clear, the fact that social medias have given us (and still do) a lot of entertainment is undeniable, this is because being able to speak with other people through text messages while being away from them creates a sensation of unconscious comfort and pleasure. You can comfortably be at home on your bed having a lot of fun with a buddy of yours gossiping, sending photographs to one another, playing games in the chat tab, and now you can even participate on a video chat with your friends. As I said, this has its good things and its bad things, now let’s talk about the bad thing of all this… Yes, you can have a lot of fun with social medias, as I said before, it’s something that’s undeniable, but, in spite of this, there’s something that’s extremely wrong with social medias, and it’s the fact that in many cases we become isolated and we forget what speaking in front of somebody else feels like, and this situation is getting even worse! Nowadays you even see groups of friends hanging out in the streets but using their smart phones all the time, not having fun and laughing out loud as it used to be before. In conclusion, nowadays smart phones and social medias have become a “Healthy Poison”.

I think that with technology we have become more closed up into our little bubbles. Technology was initially a way to maintain contact with people we care about. Instead of losing their company when they move away or have to go somewhere else we could still stay connected online. But this has led to us sticking to the same few people the whole time. In the doctor's waiting room,for instance,we don't try to make talk with the person sitting next to us, no we get online to send an emoji to some old friend from last summer. Though there's wrong with that, we do need to pay attention to our immediate surroundings and the people who are in the present moment with us.
And even when we make new friends through the internet we tend to seek out those who have the same interests as us. This is ofcourse natural for us to do, but in real life we are forced to adjust more and listen more. It is through this adjustment and listening which characterise real life conversation that exchange of ideas happen.
