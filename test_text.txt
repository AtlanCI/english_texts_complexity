We have a guest at home. This is my cousin, John. We are good friends. He has got a motorbike. And today we want to go for a ride.
We put on blue jeans, red scarves, black jackets, special glasses and funny hats. Then John and I look at the map, and off we go! It is a sunny, but windy day. John drives quickly. Our motorbike climbs up into the mountain. It is so exciting to look down. We see many goats and cows below us. They are so small!
We want to have a rest. We put the motorbike under a tree and sit on a grass. We have sandwiches, lemonade and oranges. What a lovely picnic!
Then John looks at his watch. It is late. We get on the motorbike and go home.
