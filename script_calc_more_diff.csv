14,"Tom gave the brush to Ben and he painted the fence. And, while the boy who a few moments before had been a riverboat worker and became hot in the sun, Tom sat under the tree, eating the apple and planning how to get more help.
There were enough boys. They came along the street, stopped to laugh, but remained to paint. After Ben, Bill Fisher painted. Then Johnny Miller came. Each one paid to be allowed to work. In the middle of the afternoon, Tom was very rich because he had many playthings.
And he had not worked, and the whole fence had been painted three times. There was no more paint. With more paint, Tom would soon have owned everything belonging to the other boys.
Tom had discovered a great law of human action. A man or a boy will desire something if it is not easy to get.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
16,"Tom hurried to the center of the village. There two armies of boys had met for a battle. Tom was the leader, the General, of one army, and his good friend, Joe Harper, was the General of the other. Tom and Joe did not fight. They sat together and sent their orders to the armies.
When the battle was finished, they agreed to have another battle on another day. Then the armies marched away, and Tom started to go home alone.
As he passed Jeff Thatcher's house, he saw a new girl in the garden. She had blue eyes and yellow hair. She was beautiful. Tom had loved a girl named Amy Lawrence. A week ago she had said that she loved him. He had been happy and proud. But now in a moment she was gone from his heart.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
18,"The sun rose upon a quiet world and looked warmly down upon the peaceful village. The family began the day by praying together.
Then Tom did his Sunday studying. He was trying to learn some words from the Bible. Sid had already finished his studying, but Tom was slow. His mind was busy with other things.
Tom was learning five verses. Some verses are long and some are short. Tom had found five short verses. Aunt Polly's daughter, Mary, helped him, and after a time, he could say the verses without looking at the book.
Mary gave him a knife for studying so well. It was not a good knife, but it was a knife. Tom was deeply delighted.
Then Mary helped him to dress in his Sunday clothes. When they were ready, the three children went to Sunday school.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
19,"The next morning Tom was very sad. This was the beginning of another week of slow suffering in school. He usually began this day wishing that there had been no Saturday and no Sunday. Because of them, school seemed more painful to him.
He lay in bed, thinking. If he were sick, he could stay home. He thought carefully about all parts of his body, but he could discover no sickness.
Then he looked at his foot. His foot had been hurt. He had an idea. He began to cry as if with pain. But Sid, in his bed across the room, continued to sleep. Tom's voice grew louder. Now he seemed to feel real pain in his foot.
Tom started crying and shouting, ""Sid, Sid!"" He tried shaking him. This time, the result was good.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
24,"Tom went to a place, very near, where he kept some of his things.
From this place, he took a long knife made of wood. He tied it to his side. He was not Tom Sawyer now. He dreamed he had become a famous leader named Robin Hood who had lived with his men hundreds of years before, in another forest.
He advanced slowly, moving carefully from behind one tree to another. Believing for the moment that he really was Robin Hood, he said: ""Stay where you are, my men. Do not move until I call."" Now Joe Harper appeared. He, too, had a long wooden knife.
Tom called, ""Stop! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest? No person enters my forest until I say that he may!"" ""I am Guy of Guisborne,"" said Joe Harper, continuing the game.
They took their two long knives, and began a slow, careful fight.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
27,"Tom had decided now. He was sad and without hope. He was a boy with no friends. No person loved him. He had tried to do what was right, but they would not let him. Yes, they were forcing him into a bad life. He could now choose nothing else.
He had come far from the village.
He heard the distant school bell, and he knew that he would never, never hear it again. Tears fell from his eyes.
Here he met his best friend, Joe Harper. Joe's eyes were filled with anger, and it was easy to see that there was a great and sad purpose in his heart.
Tom said that he was going to travel around the world, never to return to the village. He hoped that Joe would not forget him.
And Joe had come to say the same to Tom. They were two souls with only one thought.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
28,"Joe had been beaten by his mother. But he had done nothing. She plainly wished him to go away. Therefore, he was going. He hoped that she would be happy now. He hoped that she would never be sorry about sending her boy into the cold world to suffer and die.
The two boys walked together. They agreed to be like brothers.
They would never separate until they died. They began to plan. They decided to be pirates.
Three miles south of the village, there was an island in the river.
The Mississippi River was a mile wide there. The island was long and not very wide, and it was covered with trees. No people lived on it, and few people lived on the river's shore near the island. It would be a good place for pirates. Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

50,"Joe, Tom and Finn met again. Harper had brought meat, and Finn had some tobacco. Tom said that they must also have fire. They went to a large riverboat that was near, and they took some of the fire burning there. They knew that there were no men on the boat. The boatmen were all in the village. But the boys moved very quietly and carefully. Pirates must be pirates.
With Tom as captain of their ship, they left the shore and went into the middle of the river. From here they let the moving river carry them along. They passed the distant village. Two or three lights showed where it was, peacefully sleeping. Tom stood in the boat looking for the last time at the scene of his early joys and later sufferings. He wished that his aunt could see him now, facing the fearful future with a smile on his lips.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
52,"Tom called to the other pirates. Within a few moments they were all playing in the river near the shore. Their boat had been carried away, but this pleased them. They were certain now that they would never return to their village.
Happy and hungry, they built their fire. Huck had found some good water to drink. While Joe cooked some meat, Tom and Huck went to the river and caught some fish. Joe cooked these with the meat. No fish had ever tasted so good.
Then Huck smoked. After that, they all started to walk through the trees to see what they could discover.
They found much to delight them, but nothing surprising. The island was almost three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide. It was very near to the shore on one side, but far from the shore where their village was.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
58,"But there was no joy in the little town that same afternoon. The village was more quiet than usual. The people had little to say to each other. The children had no pleasure in their games.
Becky Thatcher was walking near the school. She thought, ""Oh, I wish I had not returned to Tom that bright, shining ball he gave me! I have nothing to help me remember him. He is gone now, and I shall never, ever see him again."" Then a large group of boys and girls, friends of Tom and Joe, came to the school and stood looking over the fence into the yard where they had played together. They spoke of things Tom and Joe had said, and of things Tom and Joe had done. They tried to learn who was the last to see the two boys. The children who were the last to talk with Tom and Joe felt very important indeed.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Intermediate,2,1
59,"The little church was filled with people. After a long time Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary and by the Harper family. All were wearing black clothes. The other people in the church stood up. They remained standing while the two families walked to the front of the church and sat down.
It was quiet again. All prayed, and then a song followed. Now the church leader began to talk of the boys. He told how good they had been. People were sorry to remember that they had not seen the truth earlier when they had thought that these boys were bad. Tears were falling from all eyes.
The sound of the church door, opening slowly, was heard. People rose and watched while the three dead boys walked to the front of the church. Tom was first, Joe next, and last came Huck.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
60,"Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers put their arms around Tom and Joe. Huck stood alone, not knowing what to do. He started to move away, but Tom stopped him and said: ""Aunt Polly, this is not right. Some person must be glad to see Huck."" ""And some person shall be. I am glad to see him, dear boy!"" She put her arms around him also. And now Huck felt more strange than before.
""Sing! And sing your best!"" cried the church leader.
And all the people did sing. There had never been such singing in that church. Tom Sawyer, the Pirate, knew that no moment in his life could be prouder than this.
That was Tom's great plan to return home with the other pirates and go to the church to hear people pray for their souls.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
61,"Boys had returned across the river in the darkness the night before, and had stayed in the forest until nearly daylight. They had entered the church and finished their sleep there before the people came. Then they appeared at the most important moment.
The next morning Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving toward Tom. He had everything that he wanted to eat. There was much more talk than usual. Aunt Polly spoke: ""We can laugh now, Tom. But you were not very kind to let me suffer. You came across the river to surprise us in the church. Why could you not come across the river to tell me that you were not really dead? Tom, some day you will be sorry. You will wish that you had cared more for me. But then it will be too late.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
62,"Tom walked slowly and proudly, feeling that all eyes were watch­ing him. Smaller boys followed him, proud to be seen with him. Boys of his own size tried not to show that they knew he had been away. But they did know. They wished that they had sun-browned skin like his. They wished that they were as famous.
Tom decided that he no longer was interested in Becky Thatcher. Being famous was enough pleasure for him. When Becky arrived at school, Tom seemed not to see her. But he saw her playing with other boys and girls. He saw that she often came near him and looked at him.
And he began talking to Amy Lawrence. Becky tried to go away from him, but her feet would not do as she wished. They carried her near to the group around Tom.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
65,"The teacher had a book that he was studying. Every day he would read some pages when he was not busy. Every boy and girl in the school wondered about this book, but none had ever seen its pages. Now, as Becky passed the teacher's table, she saw the book. She opened it and began to look at it.
Then Tom appeared at the door. Becky hurried to close the book. Her hand caught the page, and suddenly, it was in two pieces. Becky began to weep.
""You are bad, Tom Sawyer, to come and watch me! And now you will tell the teacher, and he will beat me, and what shall I do! I have never been beaten in school. But I know what is going to happen to you. You wait and you will see!"" Then, weeping, she ran outside.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
66,"The boys and girls were all busy with their books. The teacher opened his book. Tom looked at Becky. He had seen small and hunted animals in the forest. Now Becky seemed like one of them. He wished that he could help her. Becky destroyed that page. But what could he do?
The next moment the teacher stood before the school. Every eye turned away from his. All the boys and girls were afraid of him. He asked everyone about his book, but every girl and boy denied anything.
Then the teacher asked: ""Rebecca Thatcher, look at me! Did you do this to my book?"" Tom jumped to his feet and shouted, ""I did it!"" All looked at him. They could not believe what they had heard.
Tom stepped forward to take his beating. The surprise, the love shining from Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred beatings.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
67,"Summer had come for several months there would be no school. Tom discovered that the days were too long. He did not have enough to do.
He decided to make a record of everything that happened. But nothing happened during three days. He decided that a record would be of no value.
Becky Thatcher had gone away. During the summer she was living in another town with her father and her mother.
The thought of the fearful killing in the graveyard was always in Tom's mind. It was like a pain. It would not go away.
Then Tom became sick.
For two long weeks Tom remained in bed without knowing what was happening in the village. He was very ill. He was interested in nothing. Then he seemed to be better. But after a day he was ill again. He was in bed for three more weeks.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
68,"Tom was famous once again. The old people loved him and the young people wished that they were like him. His name appeared in the village newspaper. There were people who believed that he might some day become President of the United States if he escaped hanging.
Tom's days were days of joy, but his nights were filled with fear. Indian Joe was in all his dreams. Poor Huck felt the same. His name had not been called in the meetinghouse. Because Indian Joe had run away, Huck's story was not needed. But Huck was afraid that his part in the story might be told. Huck no longer trusted any human being, because Tom had broken their agreement. Sometimes Tom was afraid that Indian Joe would never be caught. Indian Joe had not been found. The slow days passed. With each day Tom became a little less afraid.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
69,"Judge Thatcher had a good opinion of Tom. He said that only a very wise boy could have brought Becky out of the cave safely. He expected Tom to become a great man.
Huck Finn's life had changed. His sufferings were almost too great for him. Mrs. Douglas had taken him to her home. She kept him clean. He must sleep every night in a clean bed. He must eat like a gentleman. He must go to church. He suffered for three weeks, and then the next day he was gone. Early on the third morning Tom Sawyer went to an old building outside the village. He found Huck. Huck had been sleeping behind the building. He was covered with dust. His hair was wild. He was wearing his old clothes. But Tom persuaded Huck to come back to Mrs. Douglas and to be a gentlemen.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Advanced,4,3

Pocahontas was the favorite daughter of Chief Powhatan. She was an Indian princess. Chief Powhatan was a powerful chief of the Algonquin tribe. Pocahontas was eleven years old. She was a lovely young girl with black hair and dark eyes. She wore a dress and moccasins. She had a feather in her hair. Pocahontas was always happy. She ran in the forest and danced in the fields.

But Powhatan's men watched Smith carefully, and he could not leave the village. Then one day Powhatan said: 'You can go home to Jamestown, John Smith. But you must give me two of your big guns.' John Smith did not like this, but he could not say no. So he went back to Jamestown, and Pocahontas, Opekankanu, and some Indians went with him.
In Jamestown Wingfield was not happy. 'We can't give our big guns to the Indians!' he said. 'Then they can kill us, with our guns!' 'It's all right,' said Smith.

'You can have corn,' he said, 'but you must build one of your big English houses for me with windows of glass. And you must give me some guns.' 'A house - yes,' said Smith. 'Tomorrow my men can bring things from Jamestown and begin to build a house for you. But guns - no. Friends do not need guns.' Powhatan smiled, but he was angry, very angry.

'You are my King,' she said quietly. 'My King now, and always.' So Smith and his men carried their guns all the time and they watched very carefully. The next morning Opekankanu and his women came with the corn.
'There is your corn,' Opekankanu said. 'Now, give us your guns!' He smiled. 'Look behind you!' Smith looked. And seven hundred Indians came out of the forest, with bows and arrows.
How can ten men fight seven hundred? In a second, John Smith had his hand in Opekankanu's hair, and his gun in Opekankanu's face.",pocahontas,1,Intermediate,2,1

'I have many beautiful things from England in my ship,' he told Iapassus. 'They are all for you – but first, you must give me something. You must bring Pocahontas onto my ship, and leave her here.'

Then everybody in the jungle suffers or will be killed by Men. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him.

When the miller's son put them on, he looked very handsome.
""Please come and ride in our carriage,"" said the King.
Puss didn't stay at the carriage, he ran quickly on ahead.
When he saw some men making hay in a field, he shouted to them: ""The King is coming. If he asks, you must say that this land belongs to the Marquis of Carrabas."" Puss said that because he wanted to show his master as a rich owner.

Meanwhile, Puss had found out that the land was really owned by an ogre, who lived in a huge castle nearby. Puss quickly made his way to the castle and knocked at the door.
He asked the ogre: ""Sir, is it true that you are a very good magician?"" The ogre replied: ""Yes, it's true. I can even turn myself into a lion!""

Puss instantly sprang upon him and ate him up.
""Now that the ogre is gone,"" Puss said to himself, ""this castle will make a fine home for my master, the Marquis of Carrabas.""

What the frog had said came true, and the queen had a little girl who was so pretty that the king could not contain himself for joy, and ordered a great feast.

In other words, he was perfect for the Memphis law firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke. Every one of the twenty partners in the firm was given a thick file on him. They knew that he had been born in poverty in Kentucky and brought up by his mother after his father's death.

His future progress at the firm, he was warned, depended on how much income he made for the firm. He learned that it was acceptable to bill clients more than he actually worked.
'If you think about a client while you're driving over to the office in the morning,' Avery told him, 'add on another hour.'

Recently Mitch had started having his lunch sometimes in a small cafe about half a mile from the Bendini Building. It was a dark hole in the wall with few customers and bad food.

A small hole was made in the corner of every room, high up where no one would notice it. A tiny microphone was placed inside each hole. A wire, no thicker than a human hair and completely invisible, ran from each microphone to the receiver. The receiver looked exactly like an old, broken radio, and it joined other old objects that were already there in a corner under the roof. It would not be noticed for months, maybe years.

In twenty years Bendini built the richest law firm in Memphis. It was also definitely the quietest. Everything was secret — especially clients' business.

A Lieutenant Binswanger of Homicide showed them Mr Big's police record and the reports about the Secatur yacht. The boat had often sailed into St Petersburg over the last six months. It always stopped at the jetty of the 'Ourobouros Worm and Bait Shippers' - a company whose main business was to sell live bait to fishing clubs in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It also sold seashells, coral and aquarium fish.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4,1
574,"According to the manager of Ourobouros, the Secatur did big business with his company and brought in shells and tropical fish from Jamaica. These were bought and then stored in the Ourobouros warehouse. Later, the shells and fish were sold to shops up and down the coast.
As they were leaving his office, Lieutenant Binswanger said, 'More gold has been coming in recently. About a hundred coins a week in Harlem and New York alone. Do you want us to do anything about it?' 'The boss says not yet,' Dexter told him.
When Bond, Dexter and Leiter were out on the pavement, Dexter said, 'I had some instructions from Washington this morning. I've got to look after the Harlem side of the case, and you two have been asked to go down to St Petersburg tomorrow.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4,1
577,"Three men waited at the bus stop on the comer of 5th Avenue and Cathedral Parkway. They had been watching the traffic on 5th Avenue since four thirty, but now a bus stopped and one of the men got on it. He saw the two white men and sat down on a seat behind them. He had been given descriptions and he recognized Bond, but not the other man.
At the next stop, he got off the bus and hurried to the nearest public phone. The Whisper questioned him urgently, then immediately started to pass on the information.
'Boss, the Englishman is on a bus on 5th Avenue. He's got a friend with him.' The Whisper then described Leiter.
'They're both coming north.' 'Warn the clubs and get this information to others, ' said the voice at the other end of the line.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4,1
579,"Bond and Leiter finished their drinks and went out onto 7th Avenue. The rain had stopped but there was an icy-cold wind. They moved along with the other people on the pavement, but the looks they were given were not friendly. The streets were dirty and many of the buildings were dark and unwelcoming. Bond wondered what secrets were held behind some of the closed doors.
'We'll go to Ma Frazier's, further up the Avenue,' said Leiter.
'It has the best food in Harlem.' They had an excellent meal of Fried Chicken Maryland with bacon and sweetcorn.
But when Leiter asked the waiter about Mr Big, the man pretended not to hear. When they had finished eating and Bond was paying the bill, Leiter tried again.
'Sorry, Sir,' said the waiter. 'I don't remember anyone with that name.'",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4,1

He put a fresh clip in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through his packing when the telephone rang.
He listened to the zing and echo on the line. He could see the big, grey building near Regent's Park and imagine the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl saying, 'Yes, this is Universal Export,' the address Bond had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for emergency calls on open lines from abroad. She would tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over.""",james bond part 2,3,Advanced,4,1

He's got to get out of New York with Leiter, the CIA man. They're going down to St Petersburg. Washington will be complaining to us in a minute. Apologize and tell them that it won't happen again.' Bond's telephone rang. It was Leiter again.
'Everyone's calmer now,' he told Bond. 'The three men you killed were Tee-Hee Johnson, Sam Miami and a man called McThing. The police wanted all of them for different crimes. The FBI wants you to be sent home, so we'd better get out of town quickly. We can't go together, so you're going on the train and I'll fly.'",james bond part 2,3,Advanced,4,1

'What time do we get into Jacksonville?' Bond asked him.
'About five o'clock in the morning, Sir,' said Baldwin.
'Is there a subway at the station?' asked Bond.
'Yes, Sir, this carriage stops next to it,' replied Baldwin.
'Can you have the door open and the steps down quickly?' said Bond.
'Yes, Sir. I can do that,' Baldwin said. Bond gave him ten dollars.

642,"Solitaire was not in the cottage and the lock of her room had been broken. Bond swore angrily to himself. He should not have left her alone. The two men had probably been carrying guns. Bond imagined the fear Solitaire must have felt as they put her in the wooden box. But how had Mr Big found her so fast? It was just another example of the fact that Mr Big's spies were everywhere.
Leiter was speaking to the FBI on the telephone. When he put the phone down, he said, 'They're sending two of their men here. I'll talk to Washington and New York.' Bond went back into Solitaire's room. Her things were still there, and he found her bag under the bed. He looked inside it and found the five thousand dollars. Bond put them into his pocket. The money would be safe with him.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
647,"Bond dropped the scorpion fish back into the tank. Suddenly, all the lights in the warehouse came on. A voice said, 'Don't move! Put your hands in the air!' Bond turned and threw himself under the tank. The Robber was about twenty yards away, pointing his rifle at him. There was a crack as The Robber fired a shot and the tank above Bond exploded like a bomb. Water poured down, but Bond had rolled into the next passageway. He quickly got up and ran. There was another shot and a second tank exploded near him.
He was now at the end of the warehouse where he had climbed in. The Robber was at the other end. Bond fired two shots from his Beretta as he quickly crossed the central passageway.
There was a crash of glass and water, a scream, and then The Robber was shooting again.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
648,"The Robber came towards Bond. When he was a few yards from Bond, he stopped. 'Put your hands up higher!' he shouted.
Bond lifted his hands across his face. Between his fingers, he saw The Robber move something on the floor with his foot. Suddenly, Bond guessed what had happened to Leiter, but there was no time to think about it now. The Robber moved nearer. At that moment, Bond dropped the gold coin from his left hand. The Robber looked down, and Bond moved quickly. He reached out with his right foot and the steel capped shoe almost kicked the rifle from the man's hands. At the same time, The Robber fired the gun. Bond threw himself at the man's stomach. The Robber began to fall backwards, and Bond kicked again with his steel capped shoe. The man screamed with pain and dropped his rifle.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
650,"Bond awoke at midday and walked down the road to a cafeteria where the short-order cook fixed him a delicious three-decker western sandwich and coffee. Then he came back to his room and wrote a detailed report to the FBI at Tampa. He omitted all reference to the gold in the poison tanks for fear that The Big Man would close down his operations in Jamaica. The nature of these had still to be discovered. Bond knew that the damage he had done to the machine in America had no bearing on the heart of his assignment--the discovery of the source of the gold, its seizure, and the destruction, if possible, of Mr Big himself.
He drove to the airport and caught the silver, four-engined plane with a few minutes to spare. He left Leiter's car in the parking space as in his report he had told the FBI he would.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
651,"The telephone rang. Long Distance. Bond found himself speaking to the head of Leiter's Section of the Central Intelligence Agency. The gist of it was that they'd be very glad if Bond would move on to Jamaica at once. All very polite. They had spoken to London, who had agreed. When should they tell London that Bond would arrive in Jamaica?
Bond knew there was a Transcarib plane via Nassau due out next day. He said he'd be taking it. Any other news? Oh yes, said the CIA. The gentleman from Harlem and his girl friend had left by plane for Havana, Cuba, during the night. Private charter. Papers were in order and charter company was such a small one the FBI had not bothered to include them when they put the watch on all airports. Arrival had been reported by the CIA man in Cuba.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
652,"Bond noticed an FBI agent watching him at the airport. He was certain that the agent was there to make sure that Bond got on the plane. They would be glad to see the last of him. Wherever he had gone in America, he had left dead bodies.
The plane for Jamaica left at five o'clock. The sun was low in the sky as the plane flew round over Tampa Bay and then flew east. Soon they were over Miami. After an early dinner, the plane stopped at Nassau before flying on across Cuba and finally to Jamaica.
When Bond arrived at Palisadoes Airport, Strangways, the Chief Secret Service Agent for the Caribbean, was there to meet him. He was good-looking, thirty-five years old and wore a black patch over one eye. The two men spoke very little until they were sitting outside Strangways's attractive white house.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
653,"Bond went quickly through the Customs and Immigration and Finance Control. It was nearly eleven and the night was quiet and hot. There was the shrill sound of crickets from the dildo cactus on both sides of the airport road and Bond gratefully drank in the sounds and smells of the tropics as the military pick-up cut across the corner of Kingston and took them up towards the gleaming, moonlit foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Bond and Strangways talked in monosyllables until they were settled on the comfortable veranda of Strangways's neat white house on the Junction Road below Stony Hill.
Strangways poured some drinks for both of them and then gave a concise account of the whole of the Jamaica end of the case.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
656,"After breakfast the next morning, Strangways introduced Quarrel to Bond.
Bond liked him. After they had discussed their plans, the two men left in the little car Quarrel had brought with him. Strangways went to get the things that Bond needed for the job ahead. By half past ten, they were travelling down the little road that went to Shark Bay. The bay was C-shaped, and in the centre was the Isle of Surprise. Quarrel pointed towards the little buildings on the top of the island. There were trees all around them, and Bond looked at them carefully through Quarrel's binoculars. Then Quarrel pointed to Beau Desert, in the middle of the western side of the 'C '.
'That's where we'll work from,' he said.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
658,"They drove back onto the main coast road and stopped for lunch on the other side of the wide bay. Then they drove to the western end of the island to the most beautiful beach Bond had ever seen. There was white sand reaching down to the sea and small fishermen's cottages with palm trees all around them.
This was where they were going to stay for the week before going to Beau Desert. Bond went for a swim while Quarrel went into the cottage and made it comfortable.
Later, when the stars and the moon shone down, the sound of the sea died to a whisper. There was the short silence between the two great winds of Jamaica, then the palm trees began to whisper again.
The next day Bond began his training. Every morning before breakfast, he swam a mile up the beach and then ran back along the sand.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
659,"At about nine o'clock, he and Quarrel would go out in a canoe. The single sail took them fast through the water, up the coast to Bloody Bay and Orange Bay.
Here they pulled the canoe up onto the beach and then went underwater hunting. Bond used a mask and an old harpoon gun.
'Fish don't usually attack a man,' Quarrel told him. 'Except the barracuda - a big, dangerous fish with very sharp teeth.' By the end of the week, Bond could swim two miles without feeling tired. His hand was completely better and he was sunburnt. Quarrel was pleased with him.
In the evening of the eighth day, they came back to the cottage to find Strangways waiting for them. He had good news for them. Felix Leiter had lost an arm and a leg, but he would not die.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1

668,"After a time, he found what he was looking for, the poisonous fish. Here the tanks were smaller, and there was only one fish in each tank. There must have been hundreds of these tanks. On the glass of each one was a sign saying VERY DANGEROUS or DON'T TOUCH.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1
671,"Bond dropped the scorpion fish back into the tank. Suddenly, all the lights in the warehouse came on. Bond turned and threw himself under the tank. The Robber was about twenty yards away, pointing his rifle at him.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4,1

681,"Bond heard the door unlock. The girl came back and slid into the seat opposite him. She looked fresh and gay. She examined him carefully.
'You have been wondering about me,' she said. 'I felt it. Don't worry. There is nothing very bad to know. I will tell you all about it some day. When we have time. Now I want to forget about the past. I will just tell you my real name. It is Simone Latrelle, but you can call me what you like. I am twenty-five. And now I am happy. I like this little room. But I am hungry and sleepy.
Their lunch arrived, brought from the diner by a preoccupied negro waiter. He seemed anxious to be paid and get back to his work.
When they had finished and Bond rang for the Pullman porter, he also seemed distrait and avoided looking at Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
682,"After lunch, Bond looked at the things that had come from London. Strangways had sent them on from Kingston. Bond put on the black frogman's suit. It fitted him perfectly. He checked the air bottle, the harpoon gun, dagger and torch. Finally, there was the heavy limpet mine with some fuses. These were in a box with the word DANGER printed on top of it. At five o'clock, Strangways arrived with news.
'Mr Big and his gang come through Port Maria and will be here soon,' he said. 'Mr Big has a passport in the name of Gallia. The girl's passport is in the name of Simone Latrelle. There are more than a hundred empty fish tanks on board.' 'I'll go to the island tomorrow night,' Bond told him.
Quarrel came in from outside. 'The boat is coming in through the coral reef now, Captain.'",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
683,"Bond, the collar of his new raincoat up round his ears, was missed as he came out of the entrance of the St Regis Drugstore on 55th Street, which has a connecting door into the hotel.
He waited in the entrance and leaped at a cruising cab, hooking the door open with the thumb of his injured hand and throwing his light suitcase in ahead of him. The cab hardly checked. The negro with the collecting-box for the Colored Veterans of Korea and his colleague fumbling under the bonnet of his stalled car stayed on the job until, much later, they were called off by a man who drove past and sounded two shorts and a long on his horn.
But Bond was immediately spotted as he left his cab at the drive-in to the Pennsylvania Station. A lounging negro with a wicker basket walked quickly into a call-box. It was ten-fifteen.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
684,"Bond and Strangways walked back up through the trees, leaving Quarrel to watch the yacht. They sat down in the living room. Bond stared out of the window, thinking. The moon was already in the sky, and the wind blew softly through the palm trees. He had travelled two thousand miles for this, but suddenly he hated and feared the sea, and everything in it. And in a few hours, he would walk alone under that black sheet of water. Quarrel came in soon after.
'They're working with lights now, Captain,' he said. 'A tank every five minutes. I guess that'll be ten hours work. They'll finish at about four in the morning, but won't sail before six. It would be too dangerous to leave earlier. It needs to be light for them to find their way through the coral reef.'",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
690,"Now Bond saw the cave that the large rock had been hiding. He swam through the opening for several yards, then stood up on soft sand. He shone his torch on the sides and ceiling of the cave. He guessed that it had been dug outwards from somewhere in the centre of the island. Probably by Bloody Morgan's men. The big rock had been there to cover the entrance. The Shark Bay fisherman who had disappeared six months ago must have found it. Perhaps a bad storm had moved it. Then the fisherman had found the treasure and had gone to Mr Big for help selling it. That had been a big mistake. Bond guessed that the fisherman had been killed and thrown into the Harlem River.
Bond guessed that his air bubbles had been seen, but he had to go on. He had to stop Solitaire getting on the boat.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
695,"Bond and Solitaire stood by some trees, and Bond breathed in the cool morning air. As they stood waiting, they saw men walking past carrying things. Everyone was leaving the island. Bond moved nearer to Solitaire. After Mr Big had left them, he had told her about the limpet mine. It would explode a few minutes after six o'clock, so it was important that the boat sailed at six. If they were still on the jetty beside the boat, they would be killed with Mr Big. Bond guessed that they would be pulled along at least seventy yards behind the yacht. The boat would go through the reef before them. With luck, the mine would explode before he and Solitaire reached the reef and were cut to pieces. But would they be killed by the explosion?",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1
698,"Bond turned and saw canoes coming towards him - and Quarrel was in the front canoe, yards ahead of the rest. For the first time since his childhood, Bond felt tears come into his blue-grey eyes. They were tears of happiness and relief. Life was suddenly very good.
Qiarrel brought them to the little beach at Beau Desert, and Bond half-carried Solitaire to the house. After they had baths and cleaned themselves, Quarrel took Bond to the hospital at Port Maria. The doctors worked on his shoulder, then Quarrel brought him back to the house. Bond was tired and covered in bandages. Another doctor had visited Solitaire, who had been cut by the coral, but was not badly hurt. Some new clothes would be brought for her from Kingston the next day.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4,1

728,"The next morning when my servant Paddock arrived, I introduced him to Captain Digby. I explained that the Captain was an important man in the army, but he had been working too hard and needed rest and quiet. Then I went out, leaving them both in the flat. When I returned at about lunchtime, the doorman told me that the gentleman in flat 15 had killed himself. I went up to the top floor, had a few words with the police, and was able to report to Scudder that his plan had been successful. Scudder was very pleased. For the first two days in my flat, he was very calm and spent all his time reading and writing in a little black notebook. But after that, he became more nervous. It was not his own danger that he worried about, but the success of his plan to prevent the murder of the Greek Prime Minister.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4,1

I wished he had told me more, and that I had listened more carefully to what he had told me. There was a risk that the government would not believe me, but it was my best chance. Perhaps more evidence would appear which would help me to make my story believable.
It was now the 24th of May, so I had twenty days of hiding. Two groups of people would be looking for me - Scudder's enemies, who would want to kill me, and the police, who would want me for Scudder's murder. There was going to be a chase, and, surprisingly, I was almost happy about this. I did not want to sit in one place and wait.

And I described the Langham Place murder in detail. 'You want adventure,' I said, 'well, here it is. The thieves are chasing me now, and the police are chasing them.'
'It's wonderful!' he whispered.
'You believe me,' I said gratefully.
'Of course I do,' he said. 'I can believe anything strange. It's things that happen every day that are difficult to believe.'
He was very young, but he was the man I needed.

All his stories about south-east Europe and people wanting to start wars were rubbish. But although he had told me lies, there was truth underneath.
The 15th of June was going to be an important day, but because of something more important than the murder of a Prime Minister. The story in his book was not complete, and there were some things I didn't understand - for example, the words 'thirty-nine steps', which appeared five or six times.
The most important thing I learned was that war was certain. Everything was planned. Karolides was going to be murdered and nothing could prevent it.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4,1

The most important officers in the armies and navies met regularly, and in June one of the top people was coming from Paris for a meeting.
But on the 15th of June other people were going to be in London. Scudder didn't give names, but called them just the 'Black Stone'. They planned to get hold of this information, which was meant only for the French Government.

It seemed strange to ask a man you had met in a car crash speak at an election meeting, 'All right,' I said. 'I'm not a good speaker, but I'll speak for a bit.'

One January afternoon, I went out and I walked towards the road. I was going to post a letter in the village. Hay was two miles from Thornfield Hall. I walked quickly and soon I was near the village.
Suddenly, a big black-and-white dog ran past me. A moment later, a man on a black horse followed the dog. Then, I heard an angry shout. The dog ran past me again. It was barking loudly. I turned round.
The horse had fallen on the icy ground and the man had fallen from the horse. I walked towards them.

Once Hercules came to ask for his help. Hercules was supposed to get three golden apples that were guarded by a dragon in a garden. Atlas agreed to get the apples if Hercules would hold the heavens and Earth on his shoulders while he was gone. When Atlas returned, he told Hercules to keep the job. Hercules asked Atlas to hold the world for just a minute. As soon as Atlas lifted the world to his shoulders, Hercules picked up the golden apples and ran away.

In medieval times, knights were sometimes challenged to duel against ghost knights, who would disappear when defeated. But it was the Victorians who really embraced ghosts, sparking a boom in ghost-related literature and spirit photography, whereby photographers used tricks to depict people with ghostly images of their dead love ones.

""Einstein proved that all the energy of the universe is constant and that it can neither be created nor destroyed... so what happens to that energy when we die? If it cannot be destroyed, it must then be transformed into another form of energy."" This goes some way to explaining why EMF meters are so popular with ghost hunters; they measure localised changes in electrical fields. And if Einstein is right and the electricity that was in our bodies when we were alive doesn't vanish upon death, then couldn't EMF machines detect this energy? No is the resounding answer from mainstream science.",myths and legends,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

So the way they grew to understand these mysteries was through stories called ""myths."" Some of the most familiar European myths come from ancient Greece. The gods and goddesses of Greek religion all had stories about them that explained just why things were the way they were. Myths are closely related to several other kinds of stories that teach us lessons. These include folktales, legends and fairy tales.

What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep, whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can sleep is by remaining partially conscious.

The life of a star spans billions of years. A star is born from clouds of dust. This cloud mass forms a spinning ball that pulls all the material toward the center. It becomes more and more dense as the material comes together. It also becomes extremely hot. Eventually it becomes so hot that the hydrogen gas begins to glow. The glowing gas ball is called a ""protostar"". A protostar becomes a star when it starts a process called fusion. The fusion process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat and light.

Some regions of Mercury are covered with heavy craters, probably created when the planet ran into other bodies as it was forming. Other regions show gently rolling plains. These may have been smoothed by volcanic lava flow. The planet also features long steep cliffs called ""scarps"" in some areas.

Humans, however, could not breathe the air there. Scientists have learned that the surface of Venus is marked with hundreds of large meteor craters.

He studied the sky for years and finally decided that the Sun sat at the center of the universe. The Earth and the other planets spun around the Sun. Some of what Copernicus said wasn't correct.

Helium is the gas that makes balloons float in air, and hydrogen is one part of water. The center of the planet is probably made of a hot liquid. Jupiter isn't a very welcoming place. It is extremely hot. It is thousands of times hotter than the hottest place on Earth. Also, storms rage on Jupiter's surface almost all the time.

Saturn is a gas planet, like Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus. Very little of it is solid. It is covered with bands of colored clouds. The thin rings that surround the planet are made of water ice and ice-covered particles. Saturn takes 29 years and 5 months in Earth time to go around the Sun just once. The Earth goes around the Sun once every 365 days. Saturn's year is so much longer because the planet is so much farther away from the Sun.",exploring space,1,Advanced,4,3

When William Herschel discovered this planet in March 1781, he named it Georgium Sidus (George's Star) in honor of his king, George III of England. In about 1850 scientists began to use the name Uranus. It takes Uranus 84 of Earth's years to go around the Sun once, so its year is 84 times as long as ours. But the planet takes only about 17 hours to spin on its axis once, so its day is shorter. Unlike other planets, Uranus lies on its side at an odd angle. It points first one pole toward the Sun, then its equator, and then the other pole. So it is not yet clear which is the planet's ""north"" pole.",exploring space,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

Like other gas planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune has rapid winds and big storms. The winds on Neptune are the fastest known in our solar system, reaching speeds of about 1,250 miles per hour. The planet rotates quickly, once every 16.1 hours. This means its day is about two-thirds as long as ours. But it has a much longer year. There are about 60,225 days in one Neptune year. That's how many days it takes the planet to orbit the Sun.

Pluto is so mysterious that scientists have not been sure what kind of body it is. For many years they called it a planet, but it is different from the other planets. Tiny Pluto's diameter is only about 1,485 miles. It's not entirely clear what Pluto is made of, but scientists think it may be 50 to 75 percent rock and the rest frozen water and gases.

Calendar making was a difficult job because certain church holy days had to happen just as a particular star was in a particular spot in the sky. In 1597 Kepler published his first important work, The Cosmographic Mystery. Kepler's book explained the distance of the planets from the Sun.

From biggest to smallest, they are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Some continents, such as Australia and Antarctica, are completely surrounded by water. And some continents are joined together, as Asia and Europe are. Earth scientists believe that the continents began forming billions of years ago. Lighter parts of Earth's molten core separated from heavier parts and rose to the top. As they cooled off and became solid, the land that would become the continents formed. The continents were probably joined together at first and then drifted apart.",planet earth,3,Advanced,4,1

The falls span the entire breadth of the Zambezi River at one of its broadest points. There is a constant roaring sound as the river falls. A dense blanket of mist covers the entire area.

The oceans are in constant motion. The gravity of the Moon and the Sun pulls on the oceans, causing tides—the regular rising and falling of the ocean along beaches and coastlines.

The Great Barrier Reef was formed over millions of years from mounds of coral. A coral is a soft animal that supports its body inside a hard hollow shell. When the coral died, its shell remained, and other corals grew on top of it. Over those millions of years, the corals remained hardened and became cemented together.

While our planet has now carved out its own path, a gigantic cloud of gas and dust whirled around 4.5 billion years ago, condensing to form heavenly bodies. It was the age of Theia – a planet that eventually struck Earth, was badly damaged and then fell apart. According to textbooks, our moon was formed from the ruins of this small world. But the story must be rewritten, at least if you believe cosmochemist Edward Young. He and his team have completed a sensational study into the collision of the two planets – and have shown that the impact could have been the starting point for life on Earth.

Even a small change in the moon's orbit could result in tide levels altering dramatically – causing widespread flooding in cities such as London and New York – climate change and even shorter days. However, there's no need to panic yet – scientists have calculated that, for this to occur, the asteroid would have to be absolutely huge – around the size of the moon.

Deep inside, the Earth is so incredibly hot that everything is melted, or molten. This molten material, or lava, escapes to the Earth's surface when volcanoes erupt. The lava cools and becomes hard and solid. This happens again and again, collecting until there is a volcanic mountain. Mount Fuji in Japan is a volcanic mountain. Other mountains were pushed up from the bottom of an ocean when two enormous portions of the Earth crashed together—very slowly, over millions and millions of years.

Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1303,"Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. ""Oh,"" she whispered. ""Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect.""
She closed the carton carefully. First she kissed her father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against her cheek. At this moment her brother Avery came into the room. Avery was ten.
He was heavily armed - an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other.
""What's that?"" he demanded. ""What's Fern got?""
""She's got a guest for breakfast,"" said Mrs. Arable. ""Wash your hands and face, Avery!""
""Let's see it!"" said Avery, setting his gun down. ""You call that miserable thing a pig? That's a fine specimen of a pig it's no bigger than a white rat.""
""Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!"" said his mother.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1304,"Fern is at the kitchen. She now has a new friend - a pig. A small one, to be sure, but nevertheless a pig. It just shows what can happen if a person gets out of bed promptly.
""Let's have breakfast,"" said Fern's mother.
But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink of milk.
Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. ""Give him his breakfast!"" she said.
A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig had a good appetite and caught on quickly.
The school bus honked from the road.
""Run!"" commanded Mrs. Arable and girls ran out to the road and climbed into the bus.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1305,"Fern loved her pig - Wilbur more than anything. She loved to stroke him, to feed him, to put him to bed. Every morning, as soon as she got up, she warmed his milk, tied his bib on, and held the bottle for him.
Every afternoon, when the school bus stopped in front of her house, she jumped out and ran to the kitchen to fix another bottle for him. She fed him again at suppertime, and again just before going to bed. Mrs. Arable gave him a feeding around noontime each day, when Fern was away in school. Wilbur loved his milk, and he was never happier than when Fern was warming up a bottle for him. He would stand and gaze up at her with adoring eyes.
For the first few days of his life, Wilbur was allowed to live in a box near the stove in the kitchen.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1306,"It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for a small pig - Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased.
""Won't he be cold at night?"" asked Fern.
""No,"" said her father. ""You watch and see what he does.""
Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1308,"The pig's new home was in the lower part of the barn, directly underneath the cows. Mr. Zuckerman knew that a manure pile is a good place to keep a young pig. Pigs need warmth, and it was warm and comfortable down there in the barn cellar on the south side.
Fern came almost every day to visit her pig - Wilbur. She found an old milking stool that had been discarded, and she placed the stool in the sheepfold next to Wilbur's pen. Here she sat quietly during the long afternoons, thinking and listening and watching Wilbur. The sheep soon got to know her and trust her.
So did the geese, who lived with the sheep. All the animals trusted her, she was so quiet and friendly. It made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made Wilbur happy to know that she was sitting there, right outside his pen.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1309,"One afternoon in June, when the pig - Wilbur was almost two months old, he wandered out into his small yard outside the barn. Fern had not arrived for her usual visit. Wilbur stood in the sun feeling lonely and bored.
""There's never anything to do around here,"" he thought. He walked slowly to his food trough and sniffed to see if anything had been overlooked at lunch. He found a small strip of potato skin and ate it. His back itched, so he leaned against the fence and rubbed against the boards.
When he tired of this, he walked indoors, climbed to the top of the manure pile, and sat down. He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of lying down. ""I'm less than two months old and I'm tired of living,"" he said. He walked out to the yard again.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1310,"The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.
Rain upset Wilbur's plans. Wilbur had planned to go out, this day, and dig a new hole in his yard. He had other plans, too. His plans for the day went something like this: Breakfast at six-thirty. Skim milk, crusts, middlings, wheat cakes with drops of maple syrup sticking to them, potato skins, leftover custard pudding with raisins, and bits of Shredded Wheat.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1311,"Wilbur had gone to sleep thinking about these plans. He awoke at six, and saw the rain, and it seemed as though he couldn't bear it.
""I get everything all beautifully planned out and it has to go and rain,"" he said.
For a while he stood gloomily indoors. Then he walked to the door and looked out. Drops of rain struck his face. His yard was cold and wet. His trough had an inch of rainwater in it. Templeton was nowhere to be seen.
""Are you out there, Templeton?"" called Wilbur. There was no answer. Suddenly Wilbur felt lonely and friendless.
""One day just like another,"" he groaned. ""I'm very young, I have no real friend here in the barn, it's going to rain all morning and all afternoon, and Fern won't come in such bad weather. Oh, honestly!"" And Wilbur was crying again.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1312,"At six-thirty Wilbur heard the banging of a pail. Lurvy was standing outside in the rain, stirring up breakfast.
""C'mon, pig!"" said Lurvy.
Wilbur did not budge. Lurvy dumped the slops, scraped the pail, and walked away. He noticed that something was wrong with the pig. Wilbur didn't want food, he wanted love. He wanted a friend - someone who would play with him.
Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think there's something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn't touched his food.""
""Give him two spoonfuls of sulphur and a little molasses,"" said Mr. Zuckerman.
Wilbur couldn't believe what was happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1313,"The night seemed long. The pig's stomach was empty and his mind was full. And when your stomach is empty and your mind is full, it's always hard to sleep.
A dozen times during the night Wilbur woke and stared into the blackness, listening to the sounds and trying to figure out what time it was. A barn is never perfectly quiet. Even at midnight there is usually something stirring.
The first time he woke, he heard Templeton gnawing a hole in the grain bin. Templeton's teeth scraped loudly against the wood and made quite a racket. ""That crazy rat!"" thought Wilbur. ""Why does he have to stay up all night, destroying people's property?""
Wilbur yawned and went back to sleep. In his dreams he heard again the voice saying, ""I'll be a friend to you. Go to sleep - you'll see me in the morning.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1314,"The barn was still dark. The sheep lay motionless. Even the goose was quiet. Overhead, on the main floor, nothing stirred: the cows were resting, the horses dozed. Templeton had quit work and gone off somewhere on an errand. The only sound was a slight scraping noise from the rooftop, where the weather-vane swung back and forth. The pig loved the barn when it was like this calm and quiet, waiting for light.
""Day is almost here,"" he thought. Through a small window, a faint gleam appeared. One by one the stars went out. Wilbur could see the goose a few feet away. She sat with head tucked under a wing. Then he could see the sheep and the lambs. The sky lightened.
""Oh, beautiful day, it is here at last! Today I shall find my friend.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1315,"Wilbur - the pig tried to find his new friend. He searched his pen thoroughly. He examined the window ledge, stared up at the ceiling. But he saw nothing new. Finally, he decided he would have to speak up. He hated to break the lovely stillness of day by using his voice, but he couldn't think of any other way to locate the mysterious new friend who was nowhere to be seen. So Wilbur cleared his throat.
""Attention, please!"" he said in a loud, firm voice. ""Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night kindly make himself or herself known by giving an appropriate sign or signal!""
Wilbur paused and listened. All the other animals lifted their heads and stared at him. Wilbur blushed. But he was determined to get in touch with his unknown friend.
He did not know it, but his friend was very near, but he was asleep.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1316,"""Salutations!"" said the voice.
Wilbur - the pig jumped to his feet. ""Salu-what?"" he cried.
""Salutations!"" repeated the voice.
""What are they, and where are you?"" screamed Wilbur. ""Please, please, tell me where you are. And what are salutations?""
""Salutations are greetings,"" said the voice. ""When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the doorway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!""
At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1317,"Good morning! Salutations! Very pleased to meet you. What is your name, please? May I have your name?""
""My name,"" said the spider, ""is Charlotte."" ""Charlotte what?"" asked Wilbur, eagerly.
""Charlotte A. Cavatica. But just call me Charlotte."" ""I think you're very beautiful,"" said Wilbur - the pig.
""Well, I am pretty,"" replied Charlotte. ""There's no denying that. Almost all spiders are rather nice-looking. I'm not as flashy as some, but I'll do. I wish I could see you, Wilbur, as clearly as you can see me.""
""Yes, but I'm near-sighted,"" replied Charlotte. ""I've always been dreadfully near-sighted. It's good in some ways, not so good in others."" Charlotte stood quietly over the fly, preparing to eat it.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1318,"Wilbur-the pig lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired from his wakeful night and from the excitement of meeting someone for the first time. A breeze brought him the smell of clover - the sweet-smelling world beyond his fence. ""Well,"" he thought, ""I've got a new friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is!
Charlotte is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty - everything I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even though she is pretty and, of course, clever?""
Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears that often go with finding a new friend. In good time he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte. Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior, she had a kind heart, and she was to prove loyal and true to the very end.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1319,"Wilbur liked the spider better and better each day. Her campaign against insects seemed sensible and useful. Hardly anybody around the farm had a good word to say for a fly. Flies spent their time pestering others. The cows hated them. The horses detested them. The sheep loathed them.
Mr. and Mrs. Zuckerman were always complaining about them, and putting up screens. Wilbur admired the way Charlotte managed. He was particularly glad that she always put her victim to sleep before eating it.
As the days went by, Wilbur grew and grew. He ate three big meals a day. He spent long hours lying on his side, half asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams. He enjoyed good health and he gained a lot of weight.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1320,"One afternoon, when Fern was sitting on her stool, the oldest sheep walked into the barn, and stopped to pay a call on Wilbur-the pig.
""Hello!"" she said. ""Seems to me you're putting on weight.""
""Yes, I guess I am,"" replied Wilbur. ""At my age it's a good idea to keep gaining.""
""Just the same, I don't envy you,"" said the old sheep. ""You know why they're fattening you up, don't you?""
""No,"" said Wilbur.
""Well, I don't like to spread bad news,"" said the sheep, ""but they're fattening you up because they're going to kill you, that's why.""
""They're going to what?"" screamed Wilbur. Fern grew rigid on her stool.
""Kill you. Turn you into smoked bacon and ham,"" continued the old sheep. ""Almost all young pigs get murdered by the farmer as soon as the real cold weather sets in.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1321,"Day after day the spider waited, head-down, for an idea to come to her. Hour by hour she sat motionless, deep in thought. Having promised Wilbur that she would save his life, she was determined to keep her promise. Charlotte was naturally patient.
She knew from experience that if she waited long enough, a fly would come to her web; and she felt sure that if she thought long enough about Wilbur's problem, an idea would come to her mind.
Finally, one morning toward the middle of July, the idea came.
""Why, how perfectly simple!"" she said to herself.
""The way to save Wilbur's life is to play a trick on Zuckerman. If I can fool a bug,"" thought Charlotte, ""I can surely fool a man. People are not as smart as bugs.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1322,"Wilbur walked into his yard just at that moment.
""What are you thinking about, Charlotte? "" he asked.
""I was just thinking,"" said the spider, ""that people are very gullible."" ""What does 'gullible' mean?""
""Easy to fool,"" said Charlotte.
""That's a mercy,"" replied Wilbur, and he lay down in the shade of his fence and went fast asleep. The spider, however, stayed wide awake, gazing affectionately at him and making plans for his future. Summer was half gone. She knew she didn't have much time.
That morning, just as Wilbur fell asleep, Avery Arable wandered into the Zuckerman's front yard, followed by Fern. Avery carried a live frog in his hand. Fern had a crown of daisies in her hair. The children ran for the kitchen to eat some pie.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1323,"Later on that morning, the animals came up from the pasture - the sheep, the lambs, the gander, the goose, and the seven goslings. There were many complaints about the awful smell, and Wilbur had to tell the story over and over again, of how the Arable boy had tried to capture Charlotte, and how the smell of the broken egg drove him away just in time.
""It was that rotten goose egg that saved Charlotte's life,"" said Wilbur. The goose was proud of her share in the adventure.
""I'm delighted that the egg never hatched,"" she gabbled.
Templeton, of course, was miserable over the loss of his beloved egg. But he couldn't resist boasting.
""It pays to save things,"" he said inhis surly voice. ""A rat never knows when something is going to, come in handy. I never throw anything away.""",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1324,"Lurvy felt weak. He brushed his hand across his eyes and stared harder at Charlotte's web.
""I'm seeing things,"" he whispered. He dropped to his knees and uttered a short prayer. Then, forgetting all about Wilbur's breakfast, he walked back to the house and called Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think you'd better come down to the pigpen,"" he said.
""What's the trouble?"" asked Mr. Zuckerman.
""Come and see for yourself,"" said Lurvy.
The two men walked silently down to Wilbur's yard. Lurvy pointed to the spider's web. ""Do you see what I see?"" he asked.
Zuckerman stared at the writing on the web. Then he murmured the words ""Some Pig."" Then he looked at Lurvy. Then they both began to tremble. Charlotte, sleepy after her night's exertions, smiled as she watched. Wilbur came and stood directly under the web.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2,1
1326,"Secrets are hard to keep. Long before Sunday came, the news spread all over the county. Everybody knew that a sign had appeared in a spider's web on the Zuckerman place. Everybody knew that the Zuckermans had a wondrous pig. People came from miles around to look at Wilbur and to read the words on Charlotte's web. The news of the wonderful pig spread clear up into the hills, and farmers came rattling down in buggies and buckboards, to stand hour after hour at Wilbur's pen admiring the miraculous animal. All said they had never seen such a pig before in their lives.
When Fern told her mother that Avery had tried to hit the Zuckermans' spider with a stick, Mrs. Arable was so shocked that she sent Avery to bed without any supper, as punishment.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1327,"Next morning, Wilbur-the pig arose and stood beneath the web. He breathed the morning air into his lungs. Drops of dew, catching the sun, made the web stand out clearly. When Lurvy arrived with breakfast, there was the handsome pig, and over him, woven neatly in block letters, was the word TERRIFIC. Another miracle.
Lurvy rushed and called Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Zuckerman rushed and called Mrs. Zuckerman. Mrs. Zuckerman ran to the phone and called the Arables. The Arables climbed into their truck and hurried over. Everybody stood at the pigpen and stared at the web and read the word, over and over, while Wilbur, who really felt terrific, stood quietly swelling out his chest and swinging his snout from side to side.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1328,"The news spread. People who had journeyed to see Wilbur when he was ""some pig"" came back again to see him now that he was ""terrific.""
That afternoon, when Mr. Zuckerman went to milk the cows and clean out the tie-ups, he was still thinking about what a wondrous pig he owned.
""Lurvy! "" he called. ""There is to be no more cow manure thrown down into that pigpen. I have a terrific pig. I want that pig to have clean, bright straw every day for his bedding. Understand?""
""Yes, sir,"" said Lurvy.
""Furthermore,"" said Mr. Zuckerman, ""I want you to start building a crate for Wilbur. I have decided to take the pig to the County Fair on September sixth. Make the crate large and paint it green with gold letters!""",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1329,"Tired from his romp, Wilbur lay down in the clean straw. He closed his eyes. The straw seemed scratchy - not as comfortable as the cow manure, which was always delightfully soft to lie in. So he pushed the straw to one side and stretched out in the manure. Wilbur sighed. It had been a busy day - his first day of being terrific. Dozens of people had visited his yard during the afternoon, and he had had to stand and pose, looking as terrific as he could. Now he was tired. Fern had arrived and seated herself quietly on her stool in the corner.
""Tell me a story, Charlotte!"" said Wilbur, as he lay waiting for sleep to come. ""Tell me a story!""

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1481,"Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, orshe fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. She tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1483,"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1484,"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked ""poison"" or not'.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1486,"She decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key.'",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1488,"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all. Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and — oh dear, how puzzling it all is!",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1490,"In another moment, Alice was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case, I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.
(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. ' I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!'",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4,2
1494,"I wish I hadn't mentioned my cat!' Alice said to herself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4,2
1496,"Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4,2
1502,"The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
1506,"Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.
'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4,2
1507,"Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.
'I — I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'
'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'
'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.'
'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4,2

As societies developed, they needed more kinds of buildings. Soon forts, barns, schools, bridges, tombs, and temples were being built, using a variety of materials. Gradually, creating buildings became an activity for experts—an art and occupation that came to be known as ""architecture."" Today architecture is a refined art requiring a lot of training, years of practice, and plenty of talent. An architect's work is to imagine and plan a building and then to supervise its construction.

Audiences were thrilled with this story of the holdup of a moving train. Some people even fainted during the final scene when an actor turned and fired his gun at the camera.

The earliest examples are cave paintings and pictographs and were probably made using animal bones and pigment. But things have changed since then. Bones and pigment have been replaced by the spray-can. Many people consider the US (and New York in particular) to be the spiritual home of modern graffiti. There was an explosion of street art in the city in the 1970s, especially in subway stations and on the sides of underground trains.

Farmers, shepherds, fisherfolk, and tradespeople who live away from cities are often the creators of folk art. Some are very skilled.

In the late 1800s, the earliest recording devices were invented. These allowed people to make copies of musical performances.
After the mid-20th century, inventors began to create electronic versions of some older instruments. They also built electronic instruments that made music in whole new ways. These instruments were called ""synthesizers"" because they artificially made, or synthesized, music.",art,3,Advanced,4,1

2848,"Three or four mounths passed, and winter arrived. I went to school almost every day and was learning to read and write and spell. The teacher was also trying to teach me mathematics, but I knew even if I studied forever, I would never learn mathematics.
At the beginning, I hated school very much, but after a while, I hated it less. Whenever I began to hate school, I simply stayed away a few days. The teacher would beat me when I returned, but the beat­ings didn't trouble me. I had become accustomed to living in a proper house with the widow and sleeping in a proper bed. The widow said that I would become a good boy if I continued to study and to improve my character and that she was no longer unhappy with me.

We crossed to the Illinois shore to a place where there were many trees and no houses. Pap took me to a small cabin made of logs. This cabin was so hidden in the trees that no one could see it from the river.
Pap stayed with me all the time, and I never had the opportuni­ty to run away. Whenever Pap left the cabin, he would lock me inside and take the key with him. At night, he slept with the key under his pillow. He had a gun, which he had stolen, and we used it to hunt ani­mals for our food. We also fished in the river. I never had to do any work or any studying. We spent most of the time fishing or just sitting and watch­ing the river.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Advanced,4,1
2857,"One day, Pap returned from a trip to the store feeling very angry. He began to shout and knock furniture to the floor. His lawyer had told him that he would never be able to force Judge Thatcher to give him the money. He also said that he heard that the widow Douglas was again asking the court to take me away from him, and this time the lawyer thought that the widow would succeed.
I knew that I did not want to return to living with the widow. I could never return to living in a proper house and going to school. I had become accustomed to the type of life that Pap and I lived and I didn't want to change again.
Pap said that he would never allow the courts to take me away from him. He would hide me in another cabin six or seven miles away, and no one would ever find me. I began to worry.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Advanced,4,1
2859,"Pap continued to shout about the government and the wrongs that it had done to him.
""I hate this government and I hate its laws. The law wants to take my son away from me—my very own son. I had all the trouble and all the worry and all the expense of raising him, and now the government wants to take him away from me. Now that my son is old enough to work and give me money, the government wants to take that son away from me. The law and the courts help Judge Thatcher to keep my son's money. I could be a rich man if the law would force Judge Thatcher to give me the 6,000 dollars. I have to live in this dirty cabin and wear old, torn clothes and eat food that pigs will not eat, all because the government won't force Judge Thatcher to give me my son's money.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Advanced,4,1

""Why are you holding that gun?"" he asked.
I knew that Pap had forgotten all that had occurred the night before.
I answered, ""Someone tried to get into the cabin last night. I took the gun to protect us."" ""You should have awakened me."" ""I tried. I really tried. I shook you, but you continued to sleep."" ""Don't stand there talking all day. Go to the river to catch some fish for breakfast. I'm hungry."" Pap unlocked the door, and I walked along the river until I found a good place to fish. I noticed many branches floating on the river. The river was much deeper than it was normally and was flowing much faster. Several large logs floated down the river.

2884,"Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.
Wendy came first, then John, then Michael. There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse. Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2885,"As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2886,"On John's footer days Nana never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2887,"Mr. Darling had sometimes a feeling that Nana did not admire him. ""I know she admires you tremendously, George,"" Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never be ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2888,"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.
If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2890,"Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2891,"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.
Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was in children's minds. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2892,"At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
""Besides,"" she said to Wendy, ""he would be grown up by this time.""
""Oh no, he isn't grown up,"" Wendy assured her confidently, ""and he is just my size.""
Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.
""Mark my words,"" he said, ""it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it will blow over.""",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2893,"Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: ""I do believe it is that Peter again!""
""Whatever do you mean, Wendy?""
""It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,"" Wendy said, sighing. She was a tidy child and didn't like when Peter did such things.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2894,"Wendy explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.
""What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking.""
""I think he comes in by the window,"" she said.
""My love, it is three floors up.""
""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?""
It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.
""My child,"" the mother cried, ""why did you not tell me of this before?""
""I forgot,"" said Wendy lightly.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2895,"On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2896,"While Mrs. Darling slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.
But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2897,"Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.
She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2899,"They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.
""I won't go to bed,"" he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, ""I won't, I won't. Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!""
Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done. Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
Michael had nearly cried.
""Nobody wants me,"" he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
""I do,"" she said, ""I so want a third child.""
Then he had leapt into her arms.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

""That is not Nana's unhappy bark,"" she said, little guessing what was about to happen; ""that is her bark when she smells danger.""
""Danger!""
""Are you sure, Wendy?""
""Oh, yes.""
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, ""Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party tonight!""",peter pan part 2,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2926,"""Tinker Bell,"" Peter called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, ""Tink, where are you?"" She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?""
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss happence to the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2928,"Wendy asked where Peter lived.
""Second to the right,"" said Peter, ""and then straight on till morning.""
""What a funny address!""
Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address.
""No, it isn't,"" he said.
""I mean,"" Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, ""is that what they put on the letters?""
He wished she had not mentioned letters.
""Don't get any letters,"" he said contemptuously.
""But your mother gets letters?""
""Don't have a mother,"" he said. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy.
""O Peter, no wonder you were crying,"" she said, and got out of bed and ran to him.
""I wasn't crying about mothers,"" he said rather indignantly. ""I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying.""",peter pan part 2,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2929,"Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. ""How awful!"" she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!
Fortunately she knew at once what to do. ""It must be sewn on,"" she said, just a little patronisingly.
""What's sewn?"" he asked.
""You're dreadfully ignorant.""
""No, I'm not.""
But she was exulting in his ignorance. ""I shall sew it on for you, my little man,"" she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife sewing bag, and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.
""I daresay it will hurt a little,"" she warned him.
""Oh, I shan't cry,"" said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2930,"Peter clenched his teeth and did not cry while Wendy was sewing it on, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.
""Perhaps I should have ironed it,"" Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself.
""How clever I am!"" he crowed rapturously, ""oh, the cleverness of me!""
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities.
But for the moment Wendy was shocked.
""You conceit braggart,"" she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; ""of course I did nothing!""
""You did a little,"" Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2936,"""Oh, how lovely to fly.""
""I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go.""
""Oo!"" she exclaimed rapturously.
""Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.""
""Oo!""
""And, Wendy, there are mermaids.""
""Mermaids! With tails?""
""Such long tails.""
""Oh,"" cried Wendy, ""to see a mermaid!""
He had become frightfully cunning. ""Wendy,"" he said, ""how we should all respect you.""
She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor.
But he had no pity for her.
""Wendy,"" he said, the sly one, ""you could tuck us in at night.""
""None of us has ever been tucked in at night. And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has any pockets.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2938,"""Out with the light! Hide! Quick!"" cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.
Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.
""There, you suspicious brute,"" she said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace. ""Everyone of the little angels sound asleep in bed.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2939,"Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.
But Liza was dense.
""No more of it, Nana,"" she said, pulling her out of the room. ""I warn you if bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just.""
She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! That was just what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it.",peter pan part 2,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2941,"""I've got it now, Wendy!"" cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.
Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.
""Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,"" he said, ""and let go.""
They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.
""I flewed!"" he screamed while still in mid-air.
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2

2958,"He had become frightfully cunning. ""Wendy,"" he said, ""how we should all respect you."" She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor. But he had no pity for her.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2961,They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.,peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2962,"Children were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.
""I say,"" cried John, ""why shouldn't we all go out?""
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.
""Mermaids!"" said Peter again.
""And there are pirates.""
""Pirates,"" cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, ""let us go at once.""
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2963,"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make her heart go softly.
Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end.
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out: ""Cave, Peter!""
Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose.
""Come,"" he cried, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy.
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2964,"""Second to the right, and straight on till morning.""
That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.
At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy. John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.
Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2965,"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.
Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2967,"When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.
""You must be nice to him,"" Wendy impressed on her brothers. ""What could we do if he were to leave us!""
""We could go back,"" Michael said.
""How could we ever find our way back without him?""
""Well, we could go on,"" said John.
""That is the awful thing, John. We don't know how to stop.""
John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2968,"Indeed children were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.
Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.
He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2971,"Peter's careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.
""They don't want us to land,"" he explained.
""Who are they?"" Wendy whispered, shuddering.
But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2974,"For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a loving little pinch.
""Then tell her,"" Wendy begged, ""to put out her light.""
""She can't put it out.
That is about the only thing fairies can't do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.""
""Then tell her to sleep at once,"" John almost ordered.
""She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other thing fairies can't do.""
""Seems to me,"" growled John, ""these are the only two things worth doing.""
Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.
""If only one of us had a pocket,"" Peter said, ""we could carry her in it.""
However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them. He had a happy idea. John's hat!",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2975,"Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.
In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.
Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. ""If only something would make a sound!"" he cried.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2976,"The air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them. The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely, ""Where are they, where are they, where are they?""
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.
When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
""Are you shot?"" John whispered tremulously.
""I haven't tried myself out yet,"" Michael whispered back.
We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2977,"I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction.
Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning ""Follow me, and all will be well.""",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2978,"Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by Peter.
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.
In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
2981,"""John, John,"" Michael would cry, ""wake up! Where is Nana, John, and mother?""
And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, ""It is true, we did fly.""
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.
""Hullo, Peter,"" they said.
""Hullo,"" replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.
""Is Wendy asleep?"" they asked.
""Yes.""
""John,"" Michael proposed, ""let us wake her and get her to make supper for us,"" but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house. ""Look at them!"" he cried.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

3003,"Peter knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.
What the boys were wondering was, would anyone answer the knock? If a lady, what would she be like?
The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their hats. She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would look.
""Where am I?"" she said.
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in.
""Wendy lady,"" he said, ""for you we built this house.""
""Oh, say you're pleased,"" cried Nibs.
""Lovely, darling house,"" Wendy said, and they were the very words they had hoped she would say.
Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, ""O Wendy lady, be our mother.""",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3005,"One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you let out your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful. Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3009,"Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.
When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, ""Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!""
Her face beamed when she exclaimed this. You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3010,"Did Wendy think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What disturbed her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother. These things scared her a little.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3011,"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3012,"Peter often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found something; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could find nothing. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3013,"The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was – but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally. Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3015,"If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.
The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3016,"The most haunting time at which to see mermaids is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about everyone being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3017,"It was a day when they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always still been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3018,"The other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting ""Peter, Wendy"" as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.
""They must be swimming back or flying,"" the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault!",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3019,"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, ""To bed, to bed,"" in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to everyone, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3020,"One important result of the brush with the pirates on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter Pan had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted something to eat.
""Peter Pan save me, me his velly nice friend.""
She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, ""It is good. Peter Pan has spoken.""",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3021,"We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.

3042,"While Wendy sewed, boys played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.
There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it.
""Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the door.""
Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.
""Watch well, braves. I have spoken.""
And then, as so often before, the children dragged him from his tree. As so often before, but never again.
He had brought nuts for the boys.
""Peter, you spoil them, you know,"" Wendy said.
""Ah, old lady,"" said Peter, hanging up his gun.
""It was me told him mothers are called old lady,"" Michael whispered to Curly.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

""I knew them,"" John said, to annoy the others.
""I think I knew them,"" said Michael rather doubtfully.
""They were married, you know,"" explained Wendy, ""and what do you think they had?""
""White rats,"" cried Nibs, inspired.
""No.""
""It's awfully puzzling,"" said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.
""Oh dear, oh dear,"" sighed Wendy. ""Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.""
""It's an awfully good story,"" said Nibs.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3049,"""Tinker Bell will take you, Wendy, across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.""
Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"" she cried.
""You are to get up, Tink,"" Nibs called, ""and take Wendy on a journey.""
Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
""She says she won't!"" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.
""Tink,"" he rapped out, ""if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains"".",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3051,"""And now, Peter,"" Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, ""I am going to give you your medicine before you go."" She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.
""Get your things, Peter,"" she cried, shaking.
""No,"" he answered, pretending indifference, ""I am not going with you, Wendy.""
""Now then,"" cried Peter, ""no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy""; and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for he had something important to do.",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1
3052,"Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.
Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.
""Who is that?""
For long there was no answer: then again the knock.
""Who are you?""
No answer.
He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled.
""I won't open unless you speak,"" Peter cried.

""Oh, you could never guess!"" Tink cried, and offered him three guesses. ""Out with it!"" he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.
Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!
""I'll rescue her!"" he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his medicine.
His hand closed on the fatal draught.
""No!"" shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest.
""Why not?""
""It is poisoned.""

""Do you believe in fairies?"" he cried.
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.
She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she wasn't sure.
""What do you think?"" she asked Peter.
""If you believe,"" he shouted to them, ""clap your hands; don't let Tink die.""
Many clapped.

He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
Peter regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.

""I don't think so,"" said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""Nibs, would -- ""
""Stow this gab,"" roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"" he said, addressing John, ""didn't you never want to be a pirate?""
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at math; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.
""I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,"" he said diffidently.
""And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.""

Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: ""Hook or me this time."" He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.
On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, ""It's Wendy's mother!

This original version of the band, formed by Marc Bolan, broke up, at which time Bolan gave it another go in 1967. The band shortened its name and switched from acoustic to electric guitars in 1970, and when Chelita Secunda put some glitter under his eyes for an appearance on Top of the Pops, glam rock was born. The band's increasing success was met with worsening behaviour from Bolan, and the band ultimately broke up in 1977 after Bolan's girlfriend wrecked his car with him in it, resulting in his death. The band made several attempts to carry on, but never achieved the same success.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

The design incorporated several new features, such as a lightweight aluminium body, power-steering, an automatic gearbox and power-braking. The 'hop on, hop off' design allowed for rapid use of the bus outside designated stops and was a large factor in its enduring popularity, despite the safety risk. Although production ceased in the 1960s, the bus survived the privatisation of London Transport and was even re-furbished to extend its life. The last bus was taken out of service in 2005, although a heritage route still allows visitors to ride this classic bus.",facts about britain,2,Upper-Intermediate,3,1

He borrowed the name for his service from the French too, which became contracted to 'bus' quite quickly. Other similar services followed, and in 1855 a joint Anglo French company bought out almost all the services and formed a monopoly. By the early 20th century, the company was operating a mixed fleet of horse-drawn and motorised buses. In 1912 it was bought out by the operators of the London Underground and the joint business soon became known as London Transport.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

Some might even have a piece of mistletoe hanging under a doorway forcing unsuspecting persons to kiss. All of these greenery traditions come from the UK, where the decorating of a home with these plants was originally a pagan tradition for the winter solstice. Evergreens were thought to keep evil spirits at bay and the presence of the masculine holly with the feminine ivy symbolised fertility. With the nation's conversion to Christianity, the evergreens came to symbolise the eternal life provided by faith in Jesus Christ. The origins for mistletoe also come from pagan culture and references fertility as well, though the exact reasons why have been seemingly lost to time.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

The young man sat down in a chair, while the room tried to tell him its history. The words it used were strange, not easy to understand, as if they were words of many distant foreign countries.
