""TOM!"" No answer.
The old lady looked around the room.
""When I find you, I—"" She did not finish. With her head down, she was looking under the bed. Only the cat came out.
There was a little noise behind her. She turned and caught a small boy, stopping him before he could escape.
""What were you doing in that corner?"" ""Nothing."" ""Nothing! What is that on your hands and face?"" ""You have been eating sweets. I have told you a hundred times not to eat those sweets."" Her hand was raised in the air—it started down—it was very near— ""Oh! Look behind you, Aunt!"" The old lady turned. The boy ran. In a moment he was up on the high board fence. Then he was on the far side of it. Aunt Polly was surprised. Then she laughed a little.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
11,"The summer evenings were long. Tom walked along the street, whistling like a bird. Then he stopped whistling. He had met a stranger, a boy a little larger than he was.
The boy's clothes were new and good, and he was wearing shoes. Tom would wear shoes and good clothes like these only to church on Sunday. Tom looked and looked.
The boy's clothes seemed to become better and better, and his own clothes seemed to grow poorer.
Neither boy spoke. If one moved, then the other moved. But they moved only to the side, in a circle. They remained face to face and eye to eye.
More moving in a circle. Now they were shoulder to shoulder, each trying to make the other fall back. And then suddenly they were both rolling in the dust.
Each pulled at the other's hair, and each hit the other's nose.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
12,"Tom appeared in front of the house with paint and a big brush. He looked at the fence, and all joy left him. A deep sadness settled upon his heart. The fence was long and high. He wet the brush and moved it along the top board. He did it again and did it again. He looked at what he had done. The painted part was very, very small. The whole fence was very large. He sat down. He felt that he could not continue.
Jim, a boy who worked for the family, came through the gate. He was going to get water, and he was singing happily.
Tom said, ""Jim, I will get the water, if you paint."" Jim said, ""No. I must get the water."" ""Are you afraid of Aunt Polly? She won't hurt you. She talks about it, but talk never hurts. You should not be afraid of her.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
13,"Tom began to think of the pleasure planned for this day. He started painting the fence slowly. The other boys would come and laugh at him for working. From his pocket, he took everything that he owned. He looked at it. There was nothing of real value. It was not enough to buy another boy's help.
At this dark moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It was like a great, bright light.
He took his brush and went quietly to work.
Ben Rogers appeared soon. Ben was eating an apple. Also as he walked, he was making noises like those of a big riverboat. He would shout loudly. Then he would say, ""Ding-­dong­-dong,"" like a bell. Then he would shout again, and say, ""Ding­-dong­dong,"" again, and make other strange noises. He was the boat, and he was the captain of the boat, and the boat bell.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
14,"Tom gave the brush to Ben and he painted the fence. And, while the boy who a few moments before had been a riverboat worker and became hot in the sun, Tom sat under the tree, eating the apple and planning how to get more help.
There were enough boys. They came along the street, stopped to laugh, but remained to paint. After Ben, Bill Fisher painted. Then Johnny Miller came. Each one paid to be allowed to work. In the middle of the afternoon, Tom was very rich because he had many playthings.
And he had not worked, and the whole fence had been painted three times. There was no more paint. With more paint, Tom would soon have owned everything belonging to the other boys.
Tom had discovered a great law of human action. A man or a boy will desire something if it is not easy to get.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
15,"Tom went to report to Aunt Polly. She was sitting beside an open window. She was half asleep, and she was holding the sleeping cat. She was surprised to see Tom.
She thought that he had run away from his work long ago.
Tom said, ""May I go and play now, Aunt?"" ""Already? How much have you done?"" ""It is all done, Aunt."" ""Tom, is that true? It makes me sad if you do not tell the truth."" ""It is true, Aunt; it is all done."" She went to see, and her surprise was very great. ""You can work when you want to, Tom. But you do not often want to. Go and play. But remember to come home again."" And she was so pleased with his work that she gave him a large apple. She did not see him take a piece of cake as he passed through the kitchen.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
16,"Tom hurried to the center of the village. There two armies of boys had met for a battle. Tom was the leader, the General, of one army, and his good friend, Joe Harper, was the General of the other. Tom and Joe did not fight. They sat together and sent their orders to the armies.
When the battle was finished, they agreed to have another battle on another day. Then the armies marched away, and Tom started to go home alone.
As he passed Jeff Thatcher's house, he saw a new girl in the garden. She had blue eyes and yellow hair. She was beautiful. Tom had loved a girl named Amy Lawrence. A week ago she had said that she loved him. He had been happy and proud. But now in a moment she was gone from his heart.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
17,"Later that evening his brother Sid was a bad boy. He took some sweets. But his aunt did not believe that Sid could be bad. She gave Tom the blow that she should have given to Sid. She learned the truth later and was sorry. But she said nothing to Tom.
Therefore, Tom was very sorry for himself. He began to wish that he would die. She would feel sorry then. He could see himself being carried home from the river, dead, his hair wet, his troubles past.
He went out into the darkness and went to the river. It would be good to drown—if he could drown without pain.
Then he thought of his flower, took it from inside his shirt and started thinking of a new girl.
This picture brought him much delightful suffering. He kept it a long time in his mind.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
18,"The sun rose upon a quiet world and looked warmly down upon the peaceful village. The family began the day by praying together.
Then Tom did his Sunday studying. He was trying to learn some words from the Bible. Sid had already finished his studying, but Tom was slow. His mind was busy with other things.
Tom was learning five verses. Some verses are long and some are short. Tom had found five short verses. Aunt Polly's daughter, Mary, helped him, and after a time, he could say the verses without looking at the book.
Mary gave him a knife for studying so well. It was not a good knife, but it was a knife. Tom was deeply delighted.
Then Mary helped him to dress in his Sunday clothes. When they were ready, the three children went to Sunday school.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
19,"The next morning Tom was very sad. This was the beginning of another week of slow suffering in school. He usually began this day wishing that there had been no Saturday and no Sunday. Because of them, school seemed more painful to him.
He lay in bed, thinking. If he were sick, he could stay home. He thought carefully about all parts of his body, but he could discover no sickness.
Then he looked at his foot. His foot had been hurt. He had an idea. He began to cry as if with pain. But Sid, in his bed across the room, continued to sleep. Tom's voice grew louder. Now he seemed to feel real pain in his foot.
Tom started crying and shouting, ""Sid, Sid!"" He tried shaking him. This time, the result was good.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
20,"Tom went to school and on his way, he met Huckleberry Finn. Huckleberry's father was always drunk. None of the mothers in the village liked Huckleberry. But all the children liked him. They wished that they dared to be like him.
Tom also wished that he could be like Huckleberry. He had been ordered never to play with him. Therefore, he played with Huckleberry every time that it was possible.
Huckleberry was always dressed in old clothes. The clothes were always too big for him. His hat was full of holes. The bottom of his coat touched the ground. He came and went as he wished. He did not sleep in a bed; he did not sleep in a house. He could go swimming or fishing when and where he might choose. He was the last boy to wear shoes in the early winter. He had everything that any boy could desire.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
21,"Tom went to class and sat in his seat.
The teacher looked at him. ""Thomas Sawyer!"" Tom knew that trouble was coming when his whole name was used.
""Why are you late again?"" Tom looked around the room. He saw the new girl. No girl sat in the seat beside her. And girls sat in all the other seats on the girls' side of the room.
He said, ""I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."" All the children looked at Tom. It was very foolish to say that to a teacher.
""Thomas Sawyer, I never heard more surprising words. Take off your coat."" The teacher had a supply of thin branches cut from a tree. He used and broke several of these while beating Tom's back. Then he ordered, ""Go and sit with the girls!"" The new girl turned her back toward Tom.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
22,"Tom sat with a girl and began to make a picture on a piece of paper. He held the hand over it while he worked and the girl could not see it. She tried to see. He seemed not to notice her interest. Then she said, ""Let me see."" He showed her. It was a picture of a house. It was not good, but she thought that it was.
""It is nice. Now make a man."" The man was bigger than the house.
""It is beautiful. Now make me."" He made a picture of another person.
""That is very nice. I wish that I could make pictures."" ""I will teach you. At noon. Do you go home to eat?"" ""I will stay if you stay."" ""Good. What is your name?"" ""Becky Thatcher. What is yours? Oh, I know. It is Thomas Sawyer."" ""That is my name when they beat me. Actually, my friends call me Tom.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
23,"Tom entered a thick forest, went to the center of it, and sat down under a tree. He was very sad. He began to think of going far away, to countries across the sea. How would Becky feel if she loses him? He would be a soldier, and return famous, after many wars. No, he would join the Indians, and hunt and fight with them in the Far West. But no, there was something better. He would sail across the seas in a long, fast black ship. He would follow other ships, take the gold and silver they carried, then send them to the bottom of the sea. That was it! He would be a pirate, famous in the whole world. Tom Sawyer the Pirate!
Yes, it was decided. He would start his journey the next morning and became the pirate.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
24,"Tom went to a place, very near, where he kept some of his things.
From this place, he took a long knife made of wood. He tied it to his side. He was not Tom Sawyer now. He dreamed he had become a famous leader named Robin Hood who had lived with his men hundreds of years before, in another forest.
He advanced slowly, moving carefully from behind one tree to another. Believing for the moment that he really was Robin Hood, he said: ""Stay where you are, my men. Do not move until I call."" Now Joe Harper appeared. He, too, had a long wooden knife.
Tom called, ""Stop! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest? No person enters my forest until I say that he may!"" ""I am Guy of Guisborne,"" said Joe Harper, continuing the game.
They took their two long knives, and began a slow, careful fight.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
25,"Tom had a new and great trouble. Becky Thatcher was ill. He was afraid that she might die.
The joy of life was gone. He played no games. He was not interested in anything.
His aunt did not know what was wrong. She tried to find some help for him.
She was always reading about health. She read about how to go to bed, and how to get up from bed, what to eat, and what to drink, and what clothes to wear for good health, and how to think for good health. She believed all that she read. When she read something new, she wanted to try it.
She took Tom outside in the early morning and poured cold water over him. Then she covered him with a wet cloth and put him to bed, with heavy covers over him. When he was so hot that water formed on his skin, she was happy. She thought that this would help him.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
26,"Tom was early at school. He was often early now. He was looking for Becky.
When Tom saw a girl's dress far away, he watched and watched. But the girl was never the right one. He entered the school and sat down to suffer.
Then one more dress came through the gate. Tom's heart jumped. The next moment he was outside again, shouting, laughing, running after other boys, jumping over the fence, standing on his head. He was doing all this to make Becky Thatcher watch him.
She never looked at him. Was it possible that she did not see him? He ran through a group of boys, and then he fell at her feet.
She turned away with her nose raised high in the air. ""Some people always want other people to look at them!"" His face became red. He stood straight and walked quietly away.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
27,"Tom had decided now. He was sad and without hope. He was a boy with no friends. No person loved him. He had tried to do what was right, but they would not let him. Yes, they were forcing him into a bad life. He could now choose nothing else.
He had come far from the village.
He heard the distant school bell, and he knew that he would never, never hear it again. Tears fell from his eyes.
Here he met his best friend, Joe Harper. Joe's eyes were filled with anger, and it was easy to see that there was a great and sad purpose in his heart.
Tom said that he was going to travel around the world, never to return to the village. He hoped that Joe would not forget him.
And Joe had come to say the same to Tom. They were two souls with only one thought.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
28,"Joe had been beaten by his mother. But he had done nothing. She plainly wished him to go away. Therefore, he was going. He hoped that she would be happy now. He hoped that she would never be sorry about sending her boy into the cold world to suffer and die.
The two boys walked together. They agreed to be like brothers.
They would never separate until they died. They began to plan. They decided to be pirates.
Three miles south of the village, there was an island in the river.
The Mississippi River was a mile wide there. The island was long and not very wide, and it was covered with trees. No people lived on it, and few people lived on the river's shore near the island. It would be a good place for pirates. Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
29,"Tom, Joe and Huck decided to be pirates. They talked and then separated. They would meet again beside the river two miles north of the village at twelve that night. Tom knew where they would find a small boat. They would take it. Each boy would bring food and other useful things, if possible.
Tom arrived with meat and a few other things. He stopped among the trees on a hill above the meeting place. There were many stars, and it was very quiet. The great river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but the quiet was broken by no sound. Then he whistled gently. The whistle was answered from below. Tom whistled two more times and was answered again. Tom went down the hill to join Huck Finn and Joe Harper. They became pirates.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

They went to a large riverboat that was near, and they took some of the fire burning there. They knew that there were no men on the boat. The boatmen were all in the village. But the boys moved very quietly and carefully. Pirates must be pirates.
With Tom as captain of their ship, they left the shore and went into the middle of the river. From here they let the moving river carry them along. They passed the distant village.

Happy and hungry, they built their fire. Huck had found some good water to drink. While Joe cooked some meat, Tom and Huck went to the river and caught some fish. Joe cooked these with the meat. No fish had ever tasted so good.
Then Huck smoked. After that, they all started to walk through the trees to see what they could discover.
They found much to delight them, but nothing surprising. The island was almost three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide. It was very near to the shore on one side, but far from the shore where their village was.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
53,"Boys played in the river often. It was the middle of the afternoon before they returned to their fire. They ate some meat again and then they sat in the shade to talk.
But the talk soon stopped. The quiet, the loneliness, were beginning to change their happiness. They began to be sad. Tom and Joe were thinking of home. Finn, who had no home, was thinking of the places where he usually went to sleep.
But they did not speak to each other of this weakness.
Now they heard a distant sound. They looked at each other, and listened. There was a long quiet, and then the sound—Boom! Then a long, long quiet, and then again, Boom!
""We must go and see."" They jumped up and ran to the shore nearer the town. The trees there were small, and grew thickly. Through them, the boys looked across the water.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
54,"The pirates returned to their fire. They were joyful that they were so important and were causing so much sadness. They caught more fish to eat. Then they talked about what the village people were thinking and saying.
But as the night grew darker, they stopped talking and sat looking into the fire. Tom and Joe thought of persons at home who were not enjoying all of this. Joe began to speak of returning to the village.
Tom laughed at him. Huck joined with Tom.
Huck fell asleep. Then Joe fell asleep. Tom sat for a long time, watching the others.
Then he decided to write a note. After writing on the wood, he put one piece in Joe's hat. He put the other in his pocket.
Then, carefully, he moved away among the trees. When he knew that they could not hear him, he began to run toward the river.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
55,"Tom had jumped over the fence behind his aunt's house. He looked through a window into a lighted room. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother. They were talking. They were beside the bed, and the bed was between them and the door.
Tom went to the door and opened it quietly. He thought that he might be able to go inside without being seen. He began moving carefully, on his knees.
""I feel a wind. Is that door open?"" said Aunt Polly. ""How strange! Many strange things are happening now. Sid, go and close the door."" Quickly Tom went under the bed. Sid did not see him.
""But,"" said Aunt Polly. ""He was not bad. He was only wild and full of life, like any young animal. He did not wish to do bad things. And no boy ever had a kinder heart."" She began to weep.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
56,"Huck said, ""I want to go home, Tom. We can go, Tom, can't we?"" ""I won't! You can go. But I am going to stay."" Huck started to walk sadly away. Tom felt a strong desire to follow.
He hoped that they would stop, but they went slowly forward. Suddenly, Tom knew that it had become very lonely and quiet.
He ran after the other boys, shouting, ""Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something."" They stopped and turned, and he began walking into the water toward them. They listened to him without an answering word or smile. But after a while they began to understand. Then they shouted with joy. They said that he should have told them his plan sooner.
The talk continued. But after a little time, there was less talk and then they went asleep.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
57,"It was a wild night for these boys. The wind caught the old sail and carried it away. Trees fell. The storm increased until they feared that it might carry the island away.
But the storm grew weaker and weaker and peace returned.
The boys found that their fire was not quite dead. They put more wood on it, making it burn brightly again. They found some of their meat and cooked it. Then they sat by their fire until morning, talking of the night's adventure, because there was no dry place for them to sleep.
When the sun began to shine, they rested in its warm light, near the shore. There they remained, sleeping, until the sun became too hot.
Then they had something to eat again. The desire for home was now strong in all of them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
58,"But there was no joy in the little town that same afternoon. The village was more quiet than usual. The people had little to say to each other. The children had no pleasure in their games.
Becky Thatcher was walking near the school. She thought, ""Oh, I wish I had not returned to Tom that bright, shining ball he gave me! I have nothing to help me remember him. He is gone now, and I shall never, ever see him again."" Then a large group of boys and girls, friends of Tom and Joe, came to the school and stood looking over the fence into the yard where they had played together. They spoke of things Tom and Joe had said, and of things Tom and Joe had done. They tried to learn who was the last to see the two boys. The children who were the last to talk with Tom and Joe felt very important indeed.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Intermediate,2
59,"The little church was filled with people. After a long time Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary and by the Harper family. All were wearing black clothes. The other people in the church stood up. They remained standing while the two families walked to the front of the church and sat down.
It was quiet again. All prayed, and then a song followed. Now the church leader began to talk of the boys. He told how good they had been. People were sorry to remember that they had not seen the truth earlier when they had thought that these boys were bad. Tears were falling from all eyes.
The sound of the church door, opening slowly, was heard. People rose and watched while the three dead boys walked to the front of the church. Tom was first, Joe next, and last came Huck.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
60,"Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers put their arms around Tom and Joe. Huck stood alone, not knowing what to do. He started to move away, but Tom stopped him and said: ""Aunt Polly, this is not right. Some person must be glad to see Huck."" ""And some person shall be. I am glad to see him, dear boy!"" She put her arms around him also. And now Huck felt more strange than before.
""Sing! And sing your best!"" cried the church leader.
And all the people did sing. There had never been such singing in that church. Tom Sawyer, the Pirate, knew that no moment in his life could be prouder than this.
That was Tom's great plan to return home with the other pirates and go to the church to hear people pray for their souls.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
61,"Boys had returned across the river in the darkness the night before, and had stayed in the forest until nearly daylight. They had entered the church and finished their sleep there before the people came. Then they appeared at the most important moment.
The next morning Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving toward Tom. He had everything that he wanted to eat. There was much more talk than usual. Aunt Polly spoke: ""We can laugh now, Tom. But you were not very kind to let me suffer. You came across the river to surprise us in the church. Why could you not come across the river to tell me that you were not really dead? Tom, some day you will be sorry. You will wish that you had cared more for me. But then it will be too late.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
62,"Tom walked slowly and proudly, feeling that all eyes were watch­ing him. Smaller boys followed him, proud to be seen with him. Boys of his own size tried not to show that they knew he had been away. But they did know. They wished that they had sun-browned skin like his. They wished that they were as famous.
Tom decided that he no longer was interested in Becky Thatcher. Being famous was enough pleasure for him. When Becky arrived at school, Tom seemed not to see her. But he saw her playing with other boys and girls. He saw that she often came near him and looked at him.
And he began talking to Amy Lawrence. Becky tried to go away from him, but her feet would not do as she wished. They carried her near to the group around Tom.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
63,"When Tom saw Becky again, she and a boy named Alfred Temple were sitting together, looking at a book. Now Tom suddenly wanted to stop talking to Amy. He escaped from her and went to look again at Becky and Alfred Temple. And Becky seemed not to see Tom. But she saw him, and she saw that he was suffering, and she was glad.
""That Alfred Temple!"" Tom thought. ""Alfred Temple and his fine clothes! I will catch you! I will take you and —"" He began hitting the air as if he were fighting with the other boy.
At noon Tom went home. Becky again looked at the book with Alfred, hoping that Tom would see them. But Tom did not appear. Suddenly she began to weep. She left Alfred and walked away.
Alfred followed, hoping to find a way to make her happy. But she didn't want to see Alfred. He was quick to understand.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
64,"Tom was happy again. He started walking to school, and soon saw Becky Thatcher, also going toward the school. Quickly he ran to her and said: ""I am sorry I acted as I did this morning, Becky. I won't ever be like that again. Please let us be friends."" The girl stopped and looked into his face. ""Go away, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I will never speak to you again."" Then she started walking again. Tom was so surprised that he could think of nothing to say. And he was filled with anger. If she were a boy, he knew that he would fight her.
Becky was also full of anger. She was thinking of the pleasure of watching the teacher beat Tom for destroying a page in his book. She did not know that she would soon have trouble also!",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
65,"The teacher had a book that he was studying. Every day he would read some pages when he was not busy. Every boy and girl in the school wondered about this book, but none had ever seen its pages. Now, as Becky passed the teacher's table, she saw the book. She opened it and began to look at it.
Then Tom appeared at the door. Becky hurried to close the book. Her hand caught the page, and suddenly, it was in two pieces. Becky began to weep.
""You are bad, Tom Sawyer, to come and watch me! And now you will tell the teacher, and he will beat me, and what shall I do! I have never been beaten in school. But I know what is going to happen to you. You wait and you will see!"" Then, weeping, she ran outside.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
66,"The boys and girls were all busy with their books. The teacher opened his book. Tom looked at Becky. He had seen small and hunted animals in the forest. Now Becky seemed like one of them. He wished that he could help her. Becky destroyed that page. But what could he do?
The next moment the teacher stood before the school. Every eye turned away from his. All the boys and girls were afraid of him. He asked everyone about his book, but every girl and boy denied anything.
Then the teacher asked: ""Rebecca Thatcher, look at me! Did you do this to my book?"" Tom jumped to his feet and shouted, ""I did it!"" All looked at him. They could not believe what they had heard.
Tom stepped forward to take his beating. The surprise, the love shining from Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred beatings.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
67,"Summer had come for several months there would be no school. Tom discovered that the days were too long. He did not have enough to do.
He decided to make a record of everything that happened. But nothing happened during three days. He decided that a record would be of no value.
Becky Thatcher had gone away. During the summer she was living in another town with her father and her mother.
The thought of the fearful killing in the graveyard was always in Tom's mind. It was like a pain. It would not go away.
Then Tom became sick.
For two long weeks Tom remained in bed without knowing what was happening in the village. He was very ill. He was interested in nothing. Then he seemed to be better. But after a day he was ill again. He was in bed for three more weeks.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
68,"Tom was famous once again. The old people loved him and the young people wished that they were like him. His name appeared in the village newspaper. There were people who believed that he might some day become President of the United States if he escaped hanging.
Tom's days were days of joy, but his nights were filled with fear. Indian Joe was in all his dreams. Poor Huck felt the same. His name had not been called in the meetinghouse. Because Indian Joe had run away, Huck's story was not needed. But Huck was afraid that his part in the story might be told. Huck no longer trusted any human being, because Tom had broken their agreement. Sometimes Tom was afraid that Indian Joe would never be caught. Indian Joe had not been found. The slow days passed. With each day Tom became a little less afraid.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
69,"Judge Thatcher had a good opinion of Tom. He said that only a very wise boy could have brought Becky out of the cave safely. He expected Tom to become a great man.
Huck Finn's life had changed. His sufferings were almost too great for him. Mrs. Douglas had taken him to her home. She kept him clean. He must sleep every night in a clean bed. He must eat like a gentleman. He must go to church. He suffered for three weeks, and then the next day he was gone. Early on the third morning Tom Sawyer went to an old building outside the village. He found Huck. Huck had been sleeping behind the building. He was covered with dust. His hair was wild. He was wearing his old clothes. But Tom persuaded Huck to come back to Mrs. Douglas and to be a gentlemen.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Advanced,4
70,"Tom said that he was going to travel around the world, never to return to the village. He hoped that Joe would not forget him. And Joe had come to say the same to Tom. They were two souls with only one thought.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Intermediate,2
71,"Joe had been beaten by his mother. But he had done nothing. She plainly wished him to go away. Therefore, he was going. He hoped that she would be happy now.

72,"The two boys walked together. They agreed to be like brothers. They would never separate until they died. They began to plan. They decided to be pirates. Three miles south of the village, there was an island in the river.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
73,"Joe, Tom and Finn met again. Harper had brought meat, and Finn had some tobacco. Tom said that they must also have fire. They went to a large riverboat that was near, and they took some of the fire burning there. They knew that there were no men on the boat.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
74,"Huck said, ""What do pirates do?"" Tom said, ""Oh, they enjoy life. They follow other ships and catch them and burn them. They take the money from those ships and put it in a deep hole in the ground on their island.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Intermediate,2
75,"The Mississippi River was a mile wide there. The island was long and not very wide, and it was covered with trees.

Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

90,"One cold winter day a little girl and her father arrived in London. Sara Crewe was seven years old, and she had long black hair and green eyes.
She sat in the cab next to her father and looked out of the windows at the tall houses and the dark sky.
'What are you thinking about, Sara?' Mr. Crewe asked. 'You are very quiet.' He put his arm round his daughter.
'I am thinking about our house in India,' said Sara. 'And the hot sun and the blue sky. I don't think I like England very much, Father.' 'Yes, it's very different from India,' her father said.
'But you must go to school in London, and I must go back to India and work'.
'Yes, Father, I know', said Sara. 'But I want to be with you. Please come to school with me! I can help you with your lessons.' Mr. Crewe smiled, but he was not happy.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
91,"Mr. Crewe and Sara arrived at Miss Minchin's School for Girls and went into the big house.
Miss Minchin was a tall woman in a black dress.
'What a beautiful child!' she said to Mr. Crewe.
Sara stood quietly and watched Miss Minchin.
'Why does she say that?' she thought. 'I am not beautiful, so why does she say it?' Sara was not beautiful, but her father was rich. And Miss Minchin liked girls with rich fathers, because it was good for school.
'Sara is a good girl,' Mr. Crewe said to Miss Minchin.
'Her mother was French, so she speaks French well.
She loves books, and she reads all the time. But she must play with the other girls and make new friends, too.' 'Of course,' said Miss Minchin. She smiled again. 'Sara is going to be very happy here, Mr. Crewe.'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
92,"Mr. Crewe stayed in London for a week. He and Sara went to the shops, and he bought many beautiful, expensive dresses for his daughter.
He bought books, and flowers for her room, and a big doll with beautiful dresses, too.
Miss Minchin smiled, but she said to her sister Amelia: 'All that money on dresses for a child of seven! She looks like a little princess, not a schoolgirl!' When Mr. Crewe left London, he was very sad. Sara was very sad too, but she did not cry. She sat in her room and thought about her father on the ship back to India.
'Father wants me to be happy,' she said to her new doll. 'I love him very much and I want to be a good daughter, so I must be happy.' It was a very big, and very beautiful doll, but of course it could not answer.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
93,"Sara made few friends in the school. Some little rich girls are not very nice children—they think they are important because they have money and lots of expensive things. But Sara was different.
She liked beautiful dresses and dolls, but she was more interested in people, and books, and telling stories.
She was a clever child, and the other girls loved to listen to her. The stories were all about kings and queens and princesses and wonderful countries across the sea.
'How do you think of all those things?' asked her best friend, Ermengarde.
'I have all these pictures in my head,' said Sara. 'So it's easy to tell stories about them'.
Ermengarde learnt her lessons through Sara's stories, and she loved her friend very much. But not everybody was Sara's friend.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
94,"The next morning Sara's new life began. She learnt to clean floors and to make fires. She ran upstairs and downstairs, and she worked in the kitchen.
The cook was a big woman with a red, angry face.
'So,' she said, 'the little rich girl is now a servant?' She looked at Sara.
'Now, I'm making apple pies this morning. Run down to the shops and get me some apples. And be quick.' So Sara ran to the shops, and carried a big bag of apples back to the house. Then she cleaned the kitchen floor, and carried hot water up to all the bedrooms.
She worked everyday, from early in the morning to late at night.
'You speak French well,' Miss Minchin said to her coldly. 'So you can teach French to the younger children. But you're only a servant. Don't forget that.' So Sara continued to work as a servant.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
95,"The first months of Sara's new life were very hard. She was always tired and hungry, but she never cried. At night, in her little attic, she thought about her father, dead in India all those miles away.
'I must be brave,' she said. 'Father always wanted me to be brave. And I have a bed to sleep in, and something to eat every day. Lots of people don't have that.' At first Sara's only friend was Becky. Every day Becky came into Sara's bedroom. They did not talk much, but it helped Sara a lot to see Becky's friendly, smiling face. The girls in the school were sorry for Sara, but Sara was a servant now, and they could not be friendly with servants. Lavinia, of course, was pleased.
'I never liked Sara Crewe,' she told her friends. 'And I was right about the diamonds—there weren't any!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
96,"Every morning, when Sara gave the birds their bread, she looked at the window next door. But nobody opened it. Nobody called out.
'Good morning!' across the roof, or gave Sara a friendly smile.
'Perhaps the Indian gentleman's servants all sleep downstairs,' she thought sadly.
Her life was very lonely now. She saw Becky every day, of course, but they did not have much time for talking. The cook and the other servants were not friendly. Sometimes, at night, Ermengarde came up to Sara's room, but it was not easy for her to come often. Then one evening, Sara was in her attic when she heard a noise on the roof. She looked up—and there at the open window was a small monkey.
'Oh, you dear little thing!' cried Sara.",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
97,"Mr. Carrisford, Indian gentleman, wanted to find Sara.
'I must find her and take care of her. But where is she? Here I am, with all this money from the diamond mines — and half of it is the girl's money. Oh, Carmichael, why did I leave my friend and run away when things looked bad? Why?' 'You ran away because you were ill with a fever,' said Mr.Carmichael. 'It nearly killed you, remember?' 'And it killed poor Ralph,' said Mr.Carrisford. 'He put all his money into the mines because I was his friend. But at first we didn't find any diamonds, and all Ralph's money was gone. I was afraid to tell him, so I ran away. And later, when we found diamonds, Ralph was dead. I must find his daughter. She's a poor orphan and needs the money'.",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
98,"When Becky saw the room, she could not speak at first. Then she said, 'Oh, Miss! What is it? How did all these things get here?' 'I don't know,' said Sara. 'It's magic. At first I thought it was a dream, but it isn't. Look— these pies are hot. Let's eat them. Hot meat pies aren't a dream!' They sat down by the fire, and ate and drank.
'Oh, those pies were good, Miss!' Becky said, 'And the tea and the cake. I don't understand magic, but I like it!' Sara looked round the room. 'Oh Becky, look! There are some books, too. I didn't see them before.' She ran to look at them, and opened the top book. 'There's some writing here! Listen. It says, to the little girl in the attic. From a friend.' Sara closed the book and looked up. 'I have a friend, Becky,' she said slowly. 'Someone is my friend.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
99,"Every evening, when Sara went up to bed, she found new things in the attic. There were more warm blankets, for her and for Becky.
There were pictures on the walls; there were books, new shoes, and a winter coat. And best of all, there was always a fire.'
'Who does it, Miss?' 'A friend does it,' Sara said. 'A kind, wonderful friend. But he doesn't want us to know his name.' They began to look at one of the new books, and then Becky looked up.
'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'There's something at the window. What is it?' Sara got up to look. 'It's the monkey!' she said. 'The monkey from next door.' She opened the window, and the monkey jumped down into her arms. 'Oh, you poor little thing,' Sara said. 'You're so cold!'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
100,"The Indian gentleman moved in his chair.
'What was your father's name?' he said.
Sara looked at him sadly. 'Ralph Crewe,"" she said. 'He died in India, two years ago.' Mr. Carrisford's face went very white.
'Carmichael,' he whispered, 'It is the child!' That was an exciting day for many people. At first poor Sara did not understand.
But Mr. Carmichael talked to her quietly and told her everything—true story about her father's friend and the diamond mines, and the two years of looking for Ralph Crewe's daughter.
'And all the time,' she said later to Mr.Carrisford, when they sat by this fire, 'I was in the house next door.' Tom Carrisford took her hand. 'Yes,' he said. 'And you're never going back there. Your home is with me now. I'm going to take care of Ralphs's Little Miss.'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
101,"The story ended happily for everybody—but not for Miss Minchin. Sara was very rich now, and Miss Minchin wanted her to come back to the school.
She came to see Mr. Carrisford, but he said some very angry things to her, and she went away with red face.
Becky came to live in Mr. Carrisford's house, too. She was Sara's servant, and she was very happy. She had a warm room, nice dresses, beautiful dolls, and good things to eat every day. And she loved Sara very much. Another Sara's friend from school, Ermengarde, often came to visit Sara, and Sara helped her with her school lessons again. Ermengarde was not clever, but she was a true friend. They often play and read together. Ermengarde liked to listen to Sara's stories about everything in the world.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
102,"Some months later Sara had her eleventh birthday. Lessons stopped for the afternoon and there was a big party for all the girls in the school.
'This party is expensive for us,' Miss Minchin said to her sister Amelia. 'But it looks good for the school.' That afternoon there was a visitor to the school Miss Minchin's lawyer. He went with Miss Minchin into her office and they closed the door. In the schoolroom next door there was a lot of noise from Sara's party. Everybody in there was very happy But in the office Miss Minchin was not happy. She looked at the lawyer angrily.
'What are you saying?' 'Sara Crewe has no money,' said the lawyer. 'Not a penny in the world, Miss Minchin, not a penny.' 'She must leave my school at once,' Miss Minchin said angrily. 'She must go this afternoon!'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
103,"Miss Minchin was very angry. Sara can't leave the school because it won't look good for the school.
Miss Minchin called her sister Amelia. ""Bring Sara Crewe here at once,"" she said.
Two minutes later Sara, in her beautiful blue party dress, stood in front of Miss Minchin.
'Have you got a black dress, Sara?' Miss Minchin said coldly.
'Yes, Miss Minchin,' said Sara. 'But it's very small.' 'Go and put it on at once,' said Miss Minchin. 'Your father is dead. There were no diamond mines, and your father's friend ran away with all his money. You have nothing. Not a penny. But I am going to be very kind to you. You can stay in my house, but now you must be a servant and work for your bread. You can sleep in a servant's room upstairs, next to Becky's room.'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
104,"That evening, in the little attic room, Sara sat on the bed in her old black dress. She did not cry, but her face was white and she did not move or speak for hours.
Late at night the door opened quietly, and Becky looked in. Her eyes were red from crying.
'Oh, Miss,' she said. 'All the servants are talking about it. I'm so sorry!' She looked at Sara's white face, and began to cry again. Then she ran to Sara, and took her hand. At last Sara moved. Slowly, she turned her head and looked at Becky.
'Oh, Becky,' she said.
And that was all. That first night in the attic was very long. Sara did not sleep.
'Father is dead,' she whispered, again and again. 'Father is dead. I'm never going to see him again.'",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
105,"Winter came, with its short, dark days, and the attic rooms were very cold. There were no fires for servant girls, and often Sara and Becky could not sleep because of the cold. Sara was taller now, and her old black dress was very short. Her shoes were old, and she had no warm coat for the winter weather. She was thin, too. She did not get very much to eat, and she was always hungry. She carried big baskets of shopping through the rain and the snow. One day she found a sixpence in the snow, and she bought some hot bread with it. Then she saw a child by the door of the shop.
The child had no shoes and no coat, and her thin face was blue with cold. 'She is hungrier than I am,' thought Sara. And she gave her hot new bread to the child.",a little princess,1,Beginner,0
106,"One night, a week later, Ermengarde got quietly out of bed and went upstairs to the attic. Sara was not there, so Ermengarde sat on the bed and waited.
At ten o'clock Sara came slowly up the stairs and into the room.
'Oh, Sara!' she cried. 'Are you ill? You look so tired!' 'It was a hard day, Ermie,' said Sara. 'Miss Minchin was angry with Cook. Then Cook was angry with us. Becky and I had no dinner and no tea.' 'Does that happen often?' said Ermengarde unhappily. 'Are you hungry now?' Sara looked at her. 'Yes,' she whispered. 'Yes, I am. I would like to eat that table. I would like to eat you.'

'Oh, Miss, look at that!' said Becky.
'You are kind, Ermie,' said Sara. She laughed. 'It's magic, you know. When things are very bad, something nice always happens. Here we are, having a party!' Ermengarde gave Sara and Becky some cake, and they began to eat. Suddenly, they stopped. There was a noise on the stairs. They listened.
'Oh no!' whispered Becky. 'It's Miss Minchin!' 'Yes,' said Sara. Her face was white again.
Then the door opened, and Miss Minchin came in.
'So, Lavinia was right,"" she said angrily. 'Tea with Princess Sara! Becky, get back to your attic at once!'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
108,"Soon the attics were quiet again. Tired and hungry, the two girls went to sleep. But after an hour or two Sara opened her eyes. Was it a noise from the window perhaps?
'Something is different,' Sara whispered. 'What is it?' She sat up in bed and looked round the room.
The room was very different. There was a wonderful hot fire. There were new, warm blankets on her bed, and beautiful pictures on the walls. Sara slowly got out of bed.
'Is this a dream?' she said. 'Where did all these things come from?' She put out her hand to the fire. 'No, it's not a dream. The fire is hot- I can feel it. And oh! Look at the table!' Sara ran to Becky's room.
'Becky,' she whispered. 'Come quickly. The magic is here again. Come and look.'",a little princess,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'Was the magic there this morning? Or did it go away in the night?' 'No, it's still there,' Sara whispered back. 'I ate some cold meat pie for breakfast. And the fire was still warm!' Becky laughed happily.
Miss Minchin wanted to see a white, unhappy face, and eyes red from crying.
'How can that child smile?' she thought angrily.
But of course, she did not know about the magic.
Every evening, when Sara went up to bed, she found new things in the attic. There were more warm blankets. There were pictures on the walls; there were books, new shoes, and a winter coat. And best of all, there was always a fire.

Pocahontas was the favorite daughter of Chief Powhatan. She was an Indian princess. Chief Powhatan was a powerful chief of the Algonquin tribe. Pocahontas was eleven years old. She was a lovely young girl with black hair and dark eyes. She wore a dress and moccasins. She had a feather in her hair. Pocahontas was always happy. She ran in the forest and danced in the fields. She sat on the hill and looked at the blue sea. On May 6, 1607, Pocahontas sat on the hill and she saw something strange in the bay. It was a big sailing ship! She was very surprised. The sailing ship was something new. She was very excited.",pocahontas,1,Intermediate,2

Her father, Chief Powhatan, was outside his longhouse. He was a tall man, with long black hair. He wore the feathers of an Indian chief on his head. He listened to the news, but he was not happy.
""The white men are here,"" Powhatan said sadly. ""This is bad news for our people. There is no peace with the white men here.""
Nantaquas was Pocahontas' brother. He was eighteen years old. He was a strong Indian warrior. He looked at his sister and said, ""In the past the white people killed the Indians. They want to take our land.""",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

""You can go to see them, but don't go near the ship. Stay far away! Be careful!"" said Powhatan. ""Remember, Pocahontas, white men are dangerous.""
Nantaquas and Pocahontas went to the river. There were many canoes near the river. They got into a small canoe. Then Nantaquas paddled down the river to the bay. In the bay they saw the big sailing ship. There was a tall, white man on the ship. He smiled at them. There were other white men too. They all looked at the small canoe and at the two Indians Pocahontas smiled at the white man. ""Let's go to the ship,"" she said.
""No,"" said Nantaquas. ""It's dangerous. We don't know who these white men are. We can look and then go home. We must obey our father.""",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

When they arrived home, Nantaquas said, ""I saw a big sailing ship. There were many white men on the ship."" Powhatan talked to his medicine men and tribe advisers. They all sat inside the longhouse for a long time.
He said, ""White men bring us problems. They have a strange magic. They carry thunder sticks to kill our people. They want to take our land, our lakes, our rivers and our forests.

134,"In January 1607 three ships left England and sailed to America. There were a hundred and fifty men on the ships, and they wanted to find a new world in the west - a home in a new and exciting country. The ships were at sea for four months, and they arrived in Virginia on the 26th April, 1607. After four long months at sea the men were tired, ill, and hungry. But Virginia was beautiful. The sky was blue, and they could see rivers, and flowers, and forests of tall trees. The Englishmen were very happy. But the Algonquin Indians of Virginia were not happy. They were afraid of the Englishmen and their ships. 'This is our home,' they said. 'We don't want these white men here. We must fight them.' But some Indians said: 'No, wait. Let's make friends with them, and learn about them.'",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
135,"The Englishmen began to build a little town. They called it Jamestown, because the King of England was called James. They called the river James River, too. The leaders of the Englishmen were Christopher Newport, Edward Wingfield, and John Smith. They wanted to learn more about Virginia, so Smith and Newport took twenty men and went up the river in a small boat. The other men stayed in Jamestown with Wingfield.
They began to build houses, and to make gardens and fields outside the town.
'The fields are more important than the houses,' said Wingfield. 'And we must work quickly, because it's nearly summer now. We must have corn and vegetables for the winter.' But it was not easy. Some men worked hard, but many sat in the sun, and did nothing.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
136,"Smith and Newport went a hundred kilometers up the river. They visited Indian villages and talked to a lot of Indians. Some of the Indians were friendly, and some were not. When Smith and Newport came back to Jamestown, Wingfield was very pleased to see them.
'I was afraid for you,' he said. 'But you're not dead!' 'No, of course not,' said Smith. 'What's the matter?' 'It's the Indians,' Wingfield said. 'They're trying to kill us. Yesterday, they nearly killed me.'
'Well, what did you do?' Smith asked. 'Our men have guns, and the Indians are very afraid of guns.' 'But there were hundreds of Indians,' said Wingfield, 'and . . . we weren't ready. Our guns were on the ships.' Why?' asked Smith angrily. 'The men must always be ready; they must carry their guns with them.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
137,"For a month everyone worked hard. People built walls round the town, and moved the big guns from the ships. But the men were afraid to work in the fields, because of the Indians. And the sun got hotter, and hotter. In June Newport went back to England with two of the ships. A hundred and five men stayed in Jamestown. They had very little food. The corn from England was now bad, and the new corn in the fields was not ready. The river water was bad too, and soon many of the men were ill with a fever. Forty-six men died that summer. Some of the men tried to leave Jamestown and go home in the ship, but Smith stopped them.
'We're here to work, and to build a new town,' he said. 'But first, We must find food. There are birds in the sky, animals in the forest - we must catch them.'",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
138,"Smith wasn't afraid of the Indians, but he was always very careful. He carried his gun all the time. Most of the Indians were afraid of Smith, but they liked him too. He was friendly, and he loved their beautiful country. And he learned their language, because he wanted to talk to them and understand them. Often, he gave the Indians little things from England, and they gave him food.
But when winter came, there were only fifty men alive in Jamestown. They had some food, but they needed more. The Virginian winter is long and cold, and fifty men need a lot of food.
In December Smith went up the river in a boat with nine men. Two of the friendly Indians went with them. It was very cold, and the Englishmen were hungry. But Smith was happy and excited.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'Tell me about these white men,' Powhatan said to his brother, Opekankanu. 'They are living in my country, and killing my people. I want to see one of them.' Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, heard this. She was thirteen years old.
'What are white men, father?' she asked. 'Are they white because they are ill?' Powhatan smiled. 'No, little Pocahontas, they aren't ill,' he said. 'They are a new people from over the sea. Perhaps we can see and talk to a white man soon. My brother is going to find one for us.' The next day Opekankanu found John Smith's nine men next to their boat by the river.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'What do you want?' he asked. 'Don't come near me!' 'King Powhatan wants to see you,' said Opekankanu.
'Give me your gun.' 'No,' Smith said at first. But there were two hundred Indians, and he was one man. So he gave them his gun, and went with Opekankanu to Werowocomoco, the village of King Powhatan.
In the village, everyone came out to see the Englishman. Pocahontas looked at Smith carefully. He was very interesting. She looked at Smith's blue eyes for a long time. They were beautiful, the colour of the sky.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'Why are you in my country, white man?' Powhatan asked. 'Where do you come from? Who is your King?' Smith told him about England, and King James, and Jamestown. It wasn't easy, because he didn't understand Powhatan's language very well, and Powhatan didn't always understand him. 'We want to live here, and be your friends, Powhatan,' he said. 'But this winter the people of Jamestown are hungry, so we need food.' Opekankanu was angry. 'These Englishmen cannot live here,' he said to his brother. 'They are taking our land and killing our people with their guns. They want King James of England to be king here, too.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Listen carefully, now. You must do this . . . ' They went back to the village. 'Are we going to kill this white man now, Powhatan?' Opekankanu asked.
'Yes,' Powhatan said. 'Bring him here.' They put John Smith's head on a stone, in front of Powhatan's feet. Then Opekankanu took a big stick, and walked to the stone.
John Smith closed his eyes, and waited to die. Suddenly, he felt warm arms on his face and head. He saw Pocahontas.",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

But Powhatan's men watched Smith carefully, and he could not leave the village. Then one day Powhatan said: 'You can go home to Jamestown, John Smith. But you must give me two of your big guns.' John Smith did not like this, but he could not say no. So he went back to Jamestown, and Pocahontas, Opekankanu, and some Indians went with him.
In Jamestown Wingfield was not happy. 'We can't give our big guns to the Indians!' he said. 'Then they can kill us, with our guns!' 'It's all right,' said Smith.
'This gun can kill ten men, Opekankanu. Remember that. So, take your two guns.'",pocahontas,1,Intermediate,2

'Look at this, Pocahontas,' John Smith said one day.
He had a compass in his hand.
'What is it?' Pocahontas asked. She tried to put her finger on the arrow in the compass, but she couldn't.
'It's a compass. The arrow always points to the north,' Smith said. 'Where is the north? Do you know?' 'Of course I know. All my people know that.' 'But why can't I put my finger on it?' Smith smiled.
'Because of the glass. You can see through glass, but you can't put your finger through it.' 'Yes,' she said slowly. 'But - what is a compass for?' 'It helps us in our ships when we can't see the sky,' he said. 'Which way do we go? Where is the north? The compass tells us all that.'",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

In March and April 1608, two more ships came to Jamestown. Powhatan asked Pocahontas about them.
'How many Englishmen are there now?' he asked.
'There were thirty-eight before the ships came, father. But now there are about a hundred and fifty.' 'It's spring now. They must sow corn and vegetables in their fields. Are they doing that?' 'Yes, father. But they aren't very good at it. This is a new country for them. They don't understand it.' 'But they must have corn!' Powhatan was angry.
'They need food for the winter. We can't give them our corn every year! And we kill animals, birds, and fish for our food - the English must learn to do that too!'",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
146,"Pocahontas liked the English, and she often visited Jamestown. John Smith liked to teach her new things.
'The sun, Pocahontas,' he said one evening, 'is a red ball in the sky. This world is a big round ball, too. Thirty years ago, an Englishman called Francis Drake sailed round the world in a ship.' Pocahontas laughed. 'But that's not true! Of course the world isn't a ball! Why does the sea stay on it, then?' Smith smiled. 'Oh, I can tell you. Listen . . . ' He talked well, so it was easy to understand him. Pocahontas listened to him. She was fourteen years old, and for her, John Smith was the most exciting man in the world.

147,"In the winter of 1608 the English in Jamestown were hungry again. So John Smith went to Werowocomoco and asked Powhatan for corn. He took many beautiful glass beads with him, because the Indians loved these things. But Powhatan wanted more than beads.
'You can have corn,' he said, 'but you must build one of your big English houses for me with windows of glass. And you must give me some guns.' 'A house - yes,' said Smith. 'Tomorrow my men can bring things from Jamestown and begin to build a house for you. But guns - no. Friends do not need guns.' Powhatan smiled, but he was angry, very angry. 'Yes, we are friends,' he said. 'Tonight you must stay here and eat with us. Tomorrow you can have your corn.'",pocahontas,1,Intermediate,2

'You are my King,' she said quietly. 'My King now, and always.' So Smith and his men carried their guns all the time and they watched very carefully. The next morning Opekankanu and his women came with the corn.
'There is your corn,' Opekankanu said. 'Now, give us your guns!' He smiled. 'Look behind you!' Smith looked. And seven hundred Indians came out of the forest, with bows and arrows.

Powhatan and Opekankanu were angry.
'We don't want these Englishmen in our country,' Powhatan said. 'We must kill them - kill them all!' 'No, father!' said Pocahontas. 'We must learn to be friends with the English. John Smith says—' 'Be quiet!' Powhatan said. 'John Smith is our enemy. Stay away from him! Do you understand?' 'But you gave him to me, father. Do you remember?

The English wanted the Indians' corn, and the Indians wanted the Englishmen's guns.
One day, in October 1609, Pocahontas went to Jamestown, but she could not find John Smith.
'Where is he?' she asked some Englishmen.
'Smith? He left Jamestown a month ago,' one man said. 'He had a bad accident with some gunpowder. He was very ill. So he went home to England.' 'Ill?' Pocahontas said. 'John Smith is ill?' 'Yes,' the man said. 'It was a very bad accident.'",pocahontas,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

I need a wife, Pocahontas, and you are the most beautiful woman in Jamestown. And the most interesting woman, too! I love you, Pocahontas, and I want to marry you.' At first, Pocahontas didn't say anything. John Rolfe was a nice man, but a long time ago, she remembered, she wanted to be the wife of a different John. 'But I'm never going to see John Smith again,' she thought. 'He's dead. I must forget about him.' She smiled at John Rolfe. 'Yes, John,' she said. 'I would very much like to be your wife.'

'How big London is!' Pocahontas said. 'There are hundreds of houses here - and thousands of people!' London was very noisy and exciting. Pocahontas was interested in everything. She went into the shops, and looked at the food and the dresses and the books. She went up and down the River Thames in a boat, and saw the big houses of rich people.
But London was very dirty, too, because there were so many people. Two of Pocahontas' people were ill, and died. But Pocahontas was happy, and excited.

'My father is the King of the Algonquin people,' she said. 'He has many men and villages. But our country is quieter than England. Our people understand the forest and the animals and the rivers. You can learn from us, and we can learn from you, too. We must be friends.' 'Of course we must,' King James said. 'Jamestown has my name, so I'm very interested in it.' They talked for some time, and then his wife, Queen Anne, said: 'I have a letter about you, Pocahontas. It's from a man called John Smith.

She looked at him, but said nothing. John Rolfe watched them. 'It's John Smith, my dear,' he said. 'Are you happy to see him?' But Pocahontas was not happy.
'No,' she said. 'I'm sorry. No.' She looked out of the window, at nothing.
John Rolfe went out, and Smith waited. After a minute he said: 'You are a wife now, and a mother.' 'Yes.' Pocahontas looked at him and tried to smile.

Pocahontas' son, Thomas, lived with the Rolfe family in England when he was a child, but in 1635 he went to live in Virginia. John Smith did not leave England again.

'The sheriff is a hard man,' they said. 'He and his rich friends take everything from us. But now brave Robin Hood and his men rob rich people and give their money to poor villagers!' In those days, the Great North Road went through Sherwood Forest. Robin Hood's men often stopped rich men in the forest, and took their money. Sometimes Prince John's men also used the road. So Robin Hood robbed him too.
'The forest is on your land,' said Prince John to the sheriff. 'Why don't you catch and kill this robber?' 'It is not so easy,' answered the sheriff. 'The village people don't want to tell me much.

One fine autumn morning, he and his friend Will Scarlet woke early.
'It is a beautiful day,' said Robin. 'I think I will go for a walk to the river. Will you come with me?' 'I want to make some new arrows for my bow,' answered Will.

'And you are not going to fish, you are going to fight!' They fought there, in the middle of the bridge. Robin couldn't win.
The man wasn't very fast but he was very strong. So Robin quickly thought of a plan.
He looked over the top of the big man's head, and shouted, 'Look, the sheriff's men!' The big man turned and looked.

'Who are you?' he asked.
'My name is Will Scarlet,' said Will, 'and I am Robin Hood's man. Are you afraid?' 'No, I am not,' said the man. 'I know that Robin Hood helps poor people. But he cannot help me.'

The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers or will be killed by Men. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him.

Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had taught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites, only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two.

Wolves often move their own cubs. They can be very gentle, and they can even carry an egg without breaking it. Father Wolf picked up the baby in his jaws, but he carried him very carefully to Mother Wolf and put him down without hurting him at all. ""He is very brave!"" said Mother Wolf softly.

""I want what I am hunting. The man's cub came here,"" said Shere Khan. ""The man cub's parents have run away. Give me the baby.""
Shere Khan had jumped into a woodcutter's campfire, just as Father Wolf had guessed, the tiger had burned his feet and he was very angry.
But Father Wolf knew that his home was too small for a tiger to get in. Even the entrance was too small for the tiger, who would not be able to fight properly there.

Now Mowgli was in their city, and the Monkey-People were very pleased with themselves.
'This boy can help us,' they said. ""He can teach us how to make things.'
But monkeys make many plans, and always forget them five minutes later.

Mowgli thought this was funny; he did not understand that he was different from the wolves. All the Jungle-People were his friends — but not Shere Khan, of course. Mother Wolf told him that the tiger wanted to kill him.
'One day you must kill Shere Khan. If you don't kill him, he will kill you.'
But Mowgli forgot. He was only a boy, not a wolf.

He sat down by the gate. When a man came out of the village, Mowgli opened his mouth to show that he wanted food.
The man ran back into the village and came back with a hundred other people. They all looked at Mowgli and saw the bite-marks on his arms and legs.

He knew all the many languages of the jungle, and so it was easy for him to learn the sounds of men. That first evening he learnt many words from Messua.
But that night he did not want to sleep inside the house. So he climbed out of the window, and went to sleep in a field near the village. Before he went to sleep, a soft grey nose touched his face.
It was Grey Brother, the eldest of Mother Wolf's cubs.

Mother Wolf came out of the cave, very happy to see Mowgli again, and to know that Shere Khan was dead. From the jungle came the deep voice of Bagheera. 'Little Brother, we are pleased to see you.'
Then Mowgli took the coat of Shere Khan and put it on the great rock at the wolves' meeting place. Akela lay on it and called, 'Look well, O Wolves!'

In the evenings he sat with the villagers under a great tree, while the men told stories about the jungle and the animals.
Once, when Buldeo, the village hunter, told a story about a tiger, Mowgli had to hide his face because he was laughing.
At the end he said, 'Buldeo's stories are stupid. He knows nothing about the jungle.'
The villagers did not like this, and after that they sent Mowgli out every day with the other boys, to look after the herds of cows and buffaloes while they ate.

'Yes,' said Mowgli. 'I will go to men. But first I must say goodbye to my mother.' And he went to the cave and cried on Mother Wolf's coat.
'Come soon, little frog,' said Father Wolf, 'because your Mother and I are getting old.'

At that moment, Dorothy saw some people coming towards her. The people were small, but they were not children. The three men had beards and the woman's hair was white.
She walked towards Dorothy and bowed.

That year, 1897, was an exciting year. Some men found gold in the cold Arctic north of Canada, and a lot of people followed them there. Everybody wanted dogs. The dogs had to pull the gold through the snow to towns and rivers.
But Buck didn't know about the cold north, or gold.",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

""I can sell Buck,"" he thought. ""He's a strong dog. Somebody will pay a lot of money for him.""
One day, Mr. Miller was at work and the children were busy.
Manuel put a rope around the dog's neck and left the house quietly. He met a man at a train station, and the man gave him money for the dog.
Buck didn't like this new man, and he started to bark. So the man pulled the rope around his neck very hard. This hurt Buck, and it made him angrier. He tried to fight the man, but the man pulled the rope again. The pain was very bad. Buck fell to the ground and his eyes closed. He opened his eyes when a loud noise woke him. Buck was very hungry and thirsty. He was on a train!",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
272,"One day, a small French-Canadian man came and looked at Buck. His name was Perrault.
""He's a big, strong dog. How much do you want for him?""
""Three hundred dollars,"" answered the man.
""This is a wonderful dog for the cold North,"" Perrault thought. ""He's strong and his coat is thick and warm.""
He bought Buck and another dog, Curly, and he took the two dogs to a boat.
On the boat, the two dogs met Francois. He and Perrault were kind and they understood dogs.
Buck and Curly also met two other dogs, Spitz and Dave. Spitz took Buck's food, so Buck didn't like him. Dave was sad and unfriendly, and wasn't interested in anything.
Day after day, the weather got colder. Then they arrived in Alaska, and Francois took the dogs off the boat. Buck walked on snow for the first time in his life.",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
273,"The first day in this new, cold country was very bad for Buck. He was a strong dog, but there were a lot of dangerous men and dogs everywhere. Buck had to be careful and he had to learn quickly.
These dogs and men were wild, and they followed the law of the club.
Buck's first new lesson, in this cold place, came quickly. Both dogs, Buck and Curly, stood near a store, in one of the camps.
A new dog walked past them. Curly wanted to be friendly, so she barked quietly.
Suddenly, the other dog turned around and attacked her. Curly was very angry, so she jumped at this strange, unfriendly dog. But the dog attacked her again and jumped away quickly.
Suddenly, he pushed Curly over and she fell on the ground. She couldn't stand up and the other dogs attacked her again and again.",the call of the wild,1,Advanced,4
274,"That night, Buck had another new problem. He wanted to sleep in a warm, dry place, so he tried to sleep with the men, not dogs.
But Perrault and Francois didn't want to sleep with a dog, and threw plates and cups at him. Buck ran away from them, and went back into the cold.
He was very unhappy; he didn't want to sleep outside. The snow was wet and cold, and the wind hurt him. He looked for the other dogs, but he couldn't see them anywhere!
Suddenly, the snow moved under his feet and he jumped back. He started to bark angrily, but then he heard a friendly bark. Buck looked down and saw Billie.
Billie was a little ball under the snow and he was happy and warm. Then Buck understood. He quickly made a little bed under the snow, and he slept very well.",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
275,"Buck was bigger than the other dogs and he was always hungry. Francois gave him a pound and a half of fish every night, but Buck always wanted more food.
Also, Buck didn't eat as quickly as the other dogs, so they often took his fish away from him.
After many days, Buck started to eat as fast as the others. And then he started to take other dogs' fish, too.
One day, another dog, Pike, took some fish from the food box. Perrault didn't see him, but Buck watched carefully. The next day, Buck did the same thing.
Buck quickly learned the ways of the wild. And now he could live in this cold, unfriendly place. He wasn't the same dog—he was quicker, smarter, and stronger.
Now a new life began for Buck. He was a wilder dog. On the cold nights, Buck looked up and howled at the dark sky.",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

So now he walked with a lot of pain.
One night, he couldn't get up and eat his fish. Francois looked at Buck's tired feet. He wanted to help him, so he cut off the tops of his boots. He made Buck four little dog boots. Buck loved his new little boots and he was happier after that.
One morning, Francois forgot about Buck's boots. He harnessed the other dogs and then called Buck. But Buck didn't go to his harness and he didn't get up. Perrault and Francois found Buck and they laughed.
Buck was on his back with his four feet up. Francois put Buck's boots on. Then the dog happily got up and walked to his harness.",the call of the wild,1,Intermediate,2

There were men and dogs and sledges everywhere. Every day the dogs ran up and down the streets and pulled wood and gold for the men. The dogs worked very hard. And every night, at twelve and at three the dogs howled at the night sky. They sang their strange song.
Seven days later, they left Dawson. The dogs were strong now, and the fighting quickly began again. Buck had small fights with Spitz every day. Now Buck was stronger and more dangerous than Spitz, and the other dogs could see this. Other dogs began to fight with Spitz, too. So the dogs began to work badly and they didn't pull the sledge well. Francois got very angry at his dogs.",the call of the wild,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Sometimes he remembered Mr. Miller's house in California. But he wasn't sad. He didn't want to go back to Mr. Miller's big house and the warm sun. He had a new home now, and a new life. This life was hard, but good.
After many more days and nights, they arrived in Dawson. Now the dogs were very tired. They were very thin, and they wanted a long rest.
But they only had two days' rest, and then they had to start again. The dogs couldn't run fast, and the men weren't happy.
And it snowed every day, so the sledge got heavier and heavier. It was the dogs' third trip back to Skaguay. And day after day, they got weaker and weaker.",the call of the wild,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

And then it was moving. Slowly at first and then faster. The fog of London was left behind. Darkness fell. I was on my way north - to Eel Marsh House. I changed trains at Crewe.

Thornton watched the two men. ""Oh, no, there's going to be a fight,"" he thought. ""And this won't be a good fight, because Barton is bigger than that other man. I'll have to do something.""
So Thornton went to Barton and spoke quietly to him. Barton turned around and hit Thornton very hard in the face.
The people in the bar heard a loud angry bark. Then a large dog quickly jumped up and ran at Barton.
Barton put up his arm and Buck attacked it. Buck hurt his neck very badly and Barton shouted with pain. Then some men pulled Buck off Barton and they took the dog outside.",the call of the wild,1,Intermediate,2

The men worked hard, day after day. They took the gold from the bottom of the river and put it into large bags. And every day, they got richer and richer. But the dogs had no work, so Buck started to take long walks in the woods. He didn't understand this new place, but he felt very happy. He started to feel something strange inside, and sometimes he could hear something. It called to him.
One night, he woke up suddenly. He could hear the call loudly, and it came from the woods. It was a long, sad howl and it didn't come from a dog. Buck jumped up and ran through the camp into the woods.",the call of the wild,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

He was very happy with his new wolf-brother. They stopped at a river and had a drink. But when he saw the river, Buck remembered Thornton. He couldn't follow his new brother.
He had to go back to the camp. So, he turned around and started to run back. But the wolf wasn't happy. For an hour, he cried and ran next to Buck. But Buck didn't stop.

Buck was next to Thornton when he slept. He stayed with him when he ate. He watched him at work.
But then he heard the call of the wolf in the woods again, and it was loud. Buck remembered his wild brother. He couldn't eat or sleep.
Buck started to walk through the woods again, and he tried to find his new brother. But he didn't hear his sad howl again.

But there was one visitor to the place every summer. He was a great, beautiful wolf—but not a wolf. He came out of the green woods and went to the open place. He stopped next to the gold river and sat for a long time. Then he howled sadly, and left. But in the long winter nights, he wasn't sad. He ran with his wild brothers, and he howled happily.

In the camp, Buck sat and watched the river. He listened to the songs of the birds, and he slowly got stronger and stronger. They all got stronger—Buck, Thornton, and his other dogs, Nig and Skeet—and they waited for Thornton's friends. Skeet was a small, friendly dog, and she was a little doctor to Buck.

Suddenly, the boat moved very quickly through the water and it hit a rock. The boat turned over and Thornton fell into the cold river. He quickly went under the fast water, and the river carried him away.
Buck jumped into the water and swam to his friend. When he came near, Thornton put his arms around Buck's neck. Then Buck tried to swim to Hans and Pete. They could pull Thornton out.

When they said goodbye, their friends weren't happy. ""Be careful!"" their friends said. ""You'll be in the wild for months, and it will be dangerous.""

But I was inside the house now. I was safe. I smiled. I did not believe in ghosts. I had work to do. And I wanted to do it well. I must forget the woman in black.
I looked around. I was standing in a dark hallway. In front of me was a wide staircase. On one side was a passage.
Perhaps it led to the kitchen. There were several doors, all of them closed. It was getting darker. I switched on a light in the hall. I went to the nearest door and opened it. I then opened one door after another. One door was locked.",the woman in black,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

I pulled up the blinds at every window. From each window I was able to see the marshes and the estuary. It was a beautiful place.
I used the keys to open some desks and cupboards. All of them were full of papers. I was sure that some of these papers were important. I had to look at all of them. This job will take a long time, I thought. It was too late to start work that afternoon.

The sky and the water were beautiful in the grey light. Then I saw the sea-mist. The mist moved about in front of my eyes. Soon my hair and clothes were wet.
Now I saw only a short way in front of me. I looked back. I was not able to see Eel Marsh House. It had completely disappeared in the mist.

After supper, I sat down by the fire and opened the packet. There were some papers and some letters.
They were signed 'Jennet' or 'J'. I remembered the gravestone I had seen. It was in the graveyard at the back of Eel Marsh House. One of the names on that gravestone had been Jennet! Was this the same Jennet?
There were dates on the letters. The letters had been written sixty years ago. Each letter began with the words, 'Dearest Alice'. Alice was Mrs Drablow's first name. All the letters were written to Mrs Alice Drablow.' I looked through them quickly. Jennet was Mrs Drablow's younger sister. I began to read the letters. They were short and in simple language. They told a sad story.",the woman in black,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

'Thank You, Mr Daily,' I said after a few moments. 'I want to leave Eel Marsh House. But I need to finish my work. I must look at all Mrs Drablow's papers. I don't think there's anything important. But they must be looked at'
'I found some letters last night,' I went on. 'They looked interesting. I'll bring them with me.'
Very slowly, I got up. I picked up the packet of letters from the desk. Then I went upstairs to get my things. My fear had gone. I was leaving Eel Marsh House.",the woman in black,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

'Well, young man,' Samuel Daily said at last, 'you've had an unhappy time here.'
'Yes,' I said. But it's finished. Those things can't harm me now, can they?'
Daily said nothing. But he looked unhappy.
'Nothing can happen now,' I said with a smile. 'I'm never going back there.'
Daily said nothing. I began to feel worried.
'Can there be anything else?' I asked. 'Nothing will harm me now, will it?' 'Not you, perhaps,' Daily said slowly.'You can leave. But we have to live with it.'
'With what?' I asked.
'This town has lived in fear for a long time,' Daily said. 'Terrible things have happened. But people don't talk about them.'

Someone was giving rides to children in a pony and trap. Our son saw the trap. He shouted and pointed at it.
It was a small trap. There was room for only two passengers. So Stella took the boy. I stood watching them happily. The trap went behind some trees. And then I saw her. The woman in black. She was standing near a big tree. My body was icy cold. I could not move. I saw the terrible hate in the woman's eyes. She moved quickly in front of the pony. The frightened pony shrieked. It turned and ran back under the trees. The driver could not stop it. There was a terrible crash. Then silence. The woman in black had gone.",the woman in black,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

The trap stopped in front of the house. For a few moments I did not move. What a strange, lonely place! But the place was so beautiful that I did not feel afraid.
I got out of the trap.
'When will the water cover the causeway again?'
'In two hours,' Keckwick answered.
I did not want to leave so soon. I wanted more time in this beautiful place.
'Two hours won't be enough time for me to do my work here,' I said. 'I'll come back here again tomorrow. I'll bring food and drink with me and stay for a day or two.
But now that I'm here, I'll have a look round the house.
What a place to live! I thought. Perhaps, one day, Stella and I will stay here. I wanted to be with her in this beautiful place.",the woman in black,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

It was time to go inside the house. And then I saw the young woman again. She was standing beside one of the gravestones. It was the woman in black. She was wearing the same old-fashioned clothes. She looked pale and ill. Her eyes were dark in her pale face. Those eyes! How can I describe them? Her eyes were evil. They stared at me with a terrible hate. There was something the woman wanted from me - something she had lost. What was it? I began to shake with fear. I felt very cold. My heart beat faster and faster. I wanted to run.",the woman in black,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

'I've received your letter,' he said. 'You can stay for a few days. Send me any papers that look important. Leave the other papers in the house. Don't stay too long!'
'I'll finish the work as quickly as I can,' I answered. 'It's a strange old house,' I added.
'Mrs Drablow was a strange old woman,' Mr Bentley said. And he put the phone down. By nine thirty, I was ready. There was a basket on the front of the bicycle. I put everything in the basket. I cycled off happily. The little dog, Spider, ran along behind me. I was soon at Eel Marsh House. I opened the windows. I sat down at a big desk. I started work. The desk was full of papers.

There was a letter from Stella at the Gifford Arms Inn. Her loving words made me feel very happy. In two or three more days we would be together again.
I walked round the town, buying more food. Then I rode back along the causeway. I was back at Eel Marsh House in time for lunch.

He left late in the evening and walked back to Savile Row. He went to bed at midnight.
Phileas Fogg was a cold man. He didn't talk much, and nobody knew much about him. But everything in his life had to be right. His washing water had to be at 31°C — not 30°C and not 32°C. At 9.37 on the morning of 2nd October 1872 his servant, James Forster, brought him water at 30°C, not 31°C. So this servant had to go. Phileas Fogg sat at home in his Savile Row house.

'Nothing will stop me,' Phileas Fogg said. In the end, Phileas Fogg's friends took the bet.
'Each person will pay you four thousand pounds — that's twenty thousand pounds — when we see you again here in the Reform Club in eighty days at the end of your journey round the world,' said Ralph.' Or you have to pay us twenty thousand pounds.'

'Is he rich?' Fix asked.
'I think he is,' said Passepartout. 'He has a lot of new banknotes with him, and he buys things all the time. He gave the captain of the Mongolia a lot of money because he wanted to get to Bombay early.'
So the detective wrote to London and asked for a warrant in Bombay. Phileas Fogg was tall and wore expensive clothes. He left London quickly. He had a lot of money in new banknotes. Phileas Fogg was, Fix thought, the Bank of England thief.

Then they threw him to the floor and took his shoes. He pushed the men away and ran out of the temple into the street.

Every two hours, the guide stopped the elephant. It ate and drank some water. Phileas Fogg, Passepartout and the guide sat under a tree, out of the sun. Then they started again.
By 8 o'clock in the evening, they were over the Vindhia mountains. They were half-way to Allahabad. The guide stopped for the night.
They started again at 6 o'clock the next morning, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon they were near Allahabad.

Passepartout thought about it, and then he had an idea. 'He is following Mr. Fogg. He is working for the five men at the Reform Club. He is watching Mr. Fogg because of the bet.'
Passepartout was angry with the five men, but he didn't tell Phileas Fogg about Fix. The five men were Mr. Fogg's friends. Passepartout didn't want Mr. Fogg to think badly of them.

'Thank you,' said Phileas Fogg.
After the visit to the ship company, Phileas Fogg took Aouda to the best hotel in Hong Kong. Then he went out and looked for her uncle. An hour later, he came back. Aouda's uncle did not live in Hong Kong now. He was in Holland.

Three weeks ago, I had been lying on a beach in Hawaii. But I was not in Hawaii now. I was dreaming in my office in Los Angeles. I had returned from my holiday and there was no work for me.
Nobody wanted to hire me. I went to my office every day, but the telephone didn't ring. So I slept in my chair and I dreamt about Hawaii.
I was dreaming a wonderful dream. The sun was hot. The noise of the sea was loud and there was a beautiful woman standing next to me.
Suddenly, there was a voice in my dream. Somebody was calling my name.
'Mr Samuel! Mr Samuel, wake up! Please, wake up! I want to talk to you.'",detective stories,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

Suddenly, she took a handkerchief out of her bag. She wiped the dust from the chair and she sat down.
'Mr Samuel,' she said. 'I saw your name and address in the telephone book. Are you cheap? And are you a good detective?'
'I'm not good,' I replied. 'I'm the best. The best private detective in L.A.'

I picked up my hat and my jacket. Quickly, I left the office. When I got to the hallway, Sandy had left the building. I went outside. I saw Sandy at the corner of the street. She was getting into a small black car — a 4x4. I got into my own car, which was parked near the office building.
As Sandy drove away, I started my old grey Chrysler and I joined the traffic. Sandy Bonner's black 4x4 was a hundred metres in front of me. It was a beautiful Friday in L.A.

Horses trained at the racetrack on the other days. The horses' owners had stables at the racetrack. They stayed in the stables while they were waiting to train. And they rested in the stables after training.
Then the horses were taken away. On training days, trailers with horses were arriving and leaving all day. Nobody checked the horses or the trailers on training days.
On racing days, the horses stayed in the stables while they were waiting to race. But on racing days, the horses' IDs were checked carefully. Racetrack officials looked at the horses' passports and at their tattoos.",detective stories,1,Advanced,4

I didn't want anyone to see me near Stable 14.
I put a third key into the lock. This time, the key turned! I opened the doors quickly and I stepped inside the stable. I locked the doors behind me.
There was very little light inside the stable. There was a smell of horses and straw. I looked around. All the stalls were empty. But there was a big cupboard on the wall, half-way along it. There was nothing in it - it was empty.",detective stories,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Then I remembered. I was in the stables area at Santa Rosita Racetrack. My hands were tied behind my back and there was a bag over my head! My whole body was painful.
What had happened to me? I remembered the two men. How long had I been on the ground? I tried to think. Then I heard a voice.
'Who are you? What's happening here?'
I knew that voice! It was Slim.
I didn't reply. Slim took the bag off my head, then he quickly untied the rope. I moved my arms. I stood up slowly. It was dark now. I had been tied up for a long time.
'Lenny! Why are you tied up?' Slim asked.
I smiled.

I picked up my binoculars and I walked towards the track.
Many people were standing by the track. Everyone was watching the racing. I stood by the track and I watched three races. They were very exciting.
Many people bet on horses. They choose the horse which they want to win a race. They make a bet on it. They bet on the horse to win the race. They pay some money at a betting office.

Suddenly, I saw him. He was about thirty and he was wearing dark glasses and a dark suit. It was the man that I had seen at the ranch and in the red 4x4. He was talking to another man, who was sitting next to him. The other man was about ten years older. He was tall and heavy. He had long red hair, tied in a pony-tail. He was wearing a brown jacket.

I moved the binoculars and I looked at some other people in the crowd. Suddenly, I saw another man that I knew - Herman! Herman started to walk towards me. He was about one hundred metres away but he hadn't seen me. I didn't want to talk to Herman. But I wanted to watch the two other men, so I didn't move. Herman came closer and closer.

'That was amazing!' said Herman. 'Golden Dragon was very fast. He's never run so fast.'
Five minutes later, there was an announcement from the loudspeakers. 'The result of the last race is, first —Golden Dragon and second—Margarita.'
I jumped up and down and I put my arms round Herman.
'Wow!' Herman said. 'How much did you win?'

It was Lou Weaver! I looked at his face. He was very pleased about something. But he was very worried about something too. He stood outside the stable.

But no lights came on.
I was going to walk back to the doors. I was going to open the doors a little. I wanted some more light inside the stable. But I didn't move.
I heard something. It was the noise of an electric motor. I took my gun out of my pocket.
Something very strange was happening. Light was coming into the dark stable. But it wasn't coming from outside. It was coming from the right-hand wall.
After a few seconds, I could see clearly. The big cupboard was moving slowly! There was a door in the wall behind the cupboard.
The cupboard was fixed to the door. The switch that I had touched had started an electric motor. And the electric motor was opening this secret door. Yes! The light was coming from behind the door!",detective stories,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

He didn't take drugs or drink too much. And he was hungry. He wanted it all: money, power, a big house, a fast car . . . He urgently wanted to succeed.
In other words, he was perfect for the Memphis law firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke. Every one of the twenty partners in the firm was given a thick file on him. They knew that he had been born in poverty in Kentucky and brought up by his mother after his father's death. They knew that he had won a place at Western Kentucky University, and had graduated top of his class. They could see the poverty hurt, and that he wanted to climb away from it.",detective stories,1,Advanced,4
453,"Lamar Quin met Mitch at the entrance to the building. After an embarrassing speech by Oliver Lambert in front of all the other associates in the second-floor library, Lamar took him on a tour of the office. There were excellent libraries on the first four floors of the five-floor building, so that no member needed to leave the office to find out anything.
'You won't see any pretty secretaries,' Lamar said softly as they watched them work. 'These are the best legal secretaries in Memphis, but they also have to be over a certain age. The firm likes its members to have steady marriages. Babies are encouraged. Of course wives are not forbidden to work.'
'I hope not,' said Mitch, puzzled by the word 'forbidden'. He decided to change the subject.",detective stories,1,Intermediate,2
454,"Mitch learned fast. He was appointed to work with one of the partners, Avery Tolleson, and helped him with several of his clients.
He learned to respect Avery's talent for hard work. Avery taught Mitch all about billing clients for his time. As an associate he could bill $100 an hour. His future progress at the firm, he was warned, depended on how much income he made for the firm. He learned that it was acceptable to bill clients more than he actually worked.
'If you think about a client while you're driving over to the office in the morning,' Avery told him, 'add on another hour.'
He could bill clients for twelve hours a day, even if he never worked twelve hours a day. Mitch also learned that Avery liked to bend the firm's rules.",detective stories,1,Intermediate,2
455,"Mitch was always the first to arrive at the office and often the last to leave as well. The partners were delighted with his progress and rewarded him with extra money. Abby got a job as a teacher at a local school, so that she wasn't just sitting around the house, bored. Mitch's ability to work long hours was already a legend, but she didn't want to be married to a legend; she wanted a flesh-and-blood person next to her.
Recently Mitch had started having his lunch sometimes in a small cafe about half a mile from the Bendini Building. It was a dark hole in the wall with few customers and bad food. He liked it because no one else from the firm went there, so he could sit quietly and read legal documents while he ate. He could always bill the client for his time.",detective stories,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
456,"A week later Mitch was having lunch with the partners in their fifth floor dining room. Each year every associate member was invited twice. Throughout lunch Mitch knew that he was being watched very closely. They were looking for any signs that he was a less keen member of the firm than he used to be. So he forced himself to smile and to eat the food they offered him. It was impossible for him to forget the pictures of him and the girl in the sand. Had they all seen the pictures? Had they passed them around this table?
Oliver Lambert had never been so charming. He told stories about past members of the firm, congratulated Mitch on the hours he was working and the amount of money he was earning the firm, and said he deserved the holiday he was taking next week.",detective stories,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
457,"They worked quickly and quietly. A tiny microphone, no bigger than a fingernail, was stuck into the mouthpiece of each phone in the house. The signals from these microphones would go to a receiver in the space under the roof of the house. Then the men turned their attention to each room. A small hole was made in the corner of every room, high up where no one would notice it. A tiny microphone was placed inside each hole. A wire, no thicker than a human hair and completely invisible, ran from each microphone to the receiver. The receiver looked exactly like an old, broken radio, and it joined other old objects that were already there in a corner under the roof. It would not be noticed for months, maybe years. And if it was noticed, it would simply be thrown away as rubbish. The receiver, of course, would also send signals from the house back to the fifth floor at Bendini, Lambert & Locke.",detective stories,1,Intermediate,2
458,"Bendini had loved the firm's office building; he had also loved secrecy. Before his death in 1970 he had filled the 100-year-old building with electronic surveillance equipment, as well as with every luxury money could buy. Only a few special members could enter certain parts of the building.
In twenty years Bendini built the richest law firm in Memphis. It was also definitely the quietest. Everything was secret — especially clients' business.
Young associates were warned that talking about the firm's business outside the firm could delay the prize of a partnership.
Nothing left the building on Front Street. Wives were told not to ask questions — or were lied to. The associates were expected to work hard and keep quiet.",detective stories,1,Advanced,4
459,"From Avery and the other partners Mitch learned the way things were done at Bendini, Lambert & Locke. He learned that secrecy was valued highly; he learned to talk to no one outside the firm, not even Abby. Mitch was determined to become a partner in less time than anyone else ever had before. He was determined to earn the firm more money than any associate ever had before. He had heard the stories about how many hours people worked; even sixteen hours a day was not unknown in the firm.
On his first full day Mitch arrived at the office at 5.30. No one else was there. He climbed the stairs to his office on the second floor, made himself a cup of coffee and began to work.

Then they watched him as the boat moved away.
'What is happening?' Edmond thought wildly. 'The judge was kind to me. He told me not to be afraid. He only told me not to say the name Noirtier. And he destroyed the letter in front of me.'
Dantes looked into the darkness. They were going out to sea. They were sailing away from everything that he loved. He turned to the nearest soldier.
'Friend,' he said, 'please tell me where we are going. I am Edmond Dantes, a seaman, and a man who loves the king. Tell me where we are going.'
'You were born in Marseilles and you are a seaman. Look!'
They were going to the prison.",the count of monte cristo,2,Intermediate,2

He was in a courtyard with high walls on all sides. He heard the feet of soldiers, walking around outside.
'Where is the prisoner?' a voice said. 'Follow me.'
Dantes followed. The man took him to a room which was almost under the ground.
'This is your room for tonight,' the man said. 'It is late, and the governor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he will send you to another place.
There is some bread and water and some dry grass to sleep on. Good night.' The man left quickly and took away his lamp. Dantes was alone in the darkness and the silence.",the count of monte cristo,2,Intermediate,2
482,"Dantes was sitting in the corner of his room. He looked up and saw the stranger with two soldiers.
'This is an important officer,' he thought. He jumped up to meet him, but the soldiers pushed him back.
'The officer thinks that I am crazy,' Dantes thought.
He looked at the officer. He tried to make his voice quiet and calm.
'I only want to know what is going to happen to me. Why am I here? Give me your permission to see a judge.'
'Perhaps,' said the chief officer. Then, turning to the governor, he said, 'Show me your books. What is this man's crime?'
'I know that you can't free me,' said Dantes. 'But tell me, please, that there is hope.'
'I can't tell you that. I can only promise to ask about the matter.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Suddenly, one evening, at about nine o'clock, Edmond heard a sound in the wall next to his bed. He listened.
'Perhaps this is only a dream, too,' he thought.
But he heard the sound again. He heard something fall — and then silence.
Some hours later, he heard the noise again, nearer and more clearly.
Edmond listened. 'I know what that sound is,' he thought. 'A prisoner is trying to escape.'
Edmond wanted to help. He moved his bed, then he looked round the room for a sharp tool. The only things in the room were a bed, a chair, a table, and a water pot.
'I will break the water pot and use one of the sharp pieces,' he thought.
He threw the pot on the floor, and it broke into pieces. He hid two or three pointed bits in his bed.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
484,"The next morning, when Dantes moved his bed away from the wall, he heard a sound. He got down on his knees.
'Is it you?' he said. 'I am here.'
Soon after that, part of the floor of Dantes' room fell away. Stones and earth fell down into the opening. Then, at the bottom of the hole, Dantes saw the arms and head of a man. The man climbed up into the room.
Dantes reached his hands out to his new friend. He was a small man, and his hair was white. His eyes were dark, and he had a long beard. He was not strong.
'You seem very happy to see me!' he said to Dantes. 'Your happiness touches my heart.'
But Dantes knew that the man was very sad.
'You worked hard to escape,' he said, 'but you haven't reached the outside of the prison. This is just another room.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
485,"Dantes looked around.
'There is one thing that I still don't understand,' he said. 'How do you do so much work?'
'I work all night.'
'At night? Can you see in the dark?'
'No, of course not. But God has given man a mind. With it, we can make what we need. I made a lamp for myself. I get the oil from my food, and it burns very well.'
Faria's words were clever and wise. Sometimes Dantes could not understand them.
'You are very wise. Will you teach me?' Dantes asked. 'I don't want you to get tired of me. A clever person doesn't want to talk to a person who knows nothing. Teach me, and then the hours will pass more quickly for you.'
Dantes learned new ideas from Faria very quickly and easily. He learned about the history of the world, and the English language, and many other things.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
486,"Dantes was wise. He kept his mouth shut after that first cry of surprise when he was underwater after his escape from the prison.
In his right hand he still held the knife. He quickly cut open the bag, got one arm out and then his body. The stone pulled him down and down, and he felt very weak. But he reached down and cut the stone free. Then he swam quickly to the top of the water, and the stone fell to the bottom of the sea.
Dantes felt the night air on his face. He began to swim under the water because he did not want the guards to see him.
When he came up again, he was nearly a hundred metres from the prison. Above him, he saw a black and stormy sky. In front of him lay the great black sea. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the clouds, stood the Chateau d'If.",the count of monte cristo,2,Intermediate,2
487,"The ship reached Livorno. Edmond asked a man there to shave him and cut his hair. When the job was finished, he asked for a mirror. He saw the changes in his face.
'When I went to the Chateau d'If, my face was round and open. It was the face of a young and happy man,' he said to himself. Now his face was longer. His mouth was harder and stronger. His eyes were deep and thoughtful, and his skin was whiter. Even his voice was softer and sadder.
'I don't know myself,' he thought. 'I am a stranger.'
Next, he went to buy some clothes. Then, a changed man, he went back on board the Young Amelia.
The men of the Young Amelia worked hard for their captain. They spent very little time in Livorno. The captain wanted to get the goods out of the city quickly, and to take them to Corsica.",the count of monte cristo,2,Intermediate,2
488,"The sun shone in the sky and coloured the rocks a soft pink. It was the island of Monte Cristo.
'I can jump over the side of the ship,' Dantes thought, 'and swim to the island in an hour. But if I do that, how will I get the treasure away? I must wait. I waited for years to be free. I can wait for a few months to be rich.'
He looked again at the island.
'Perhaps the treasure is only a dream, a dream of Faria's. But there was Prince Spada's letter. That seemed real.'
Dantes repeated the letter to himself from the beginning to the end; he remembered every word.
Night came, and Edmond watched the island. It was beautiful with the colours of the evening, then slowly it hid itself in the darkness.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
489,"Dantes thought about his problem all the time.
'How can I reach Monte Cristo? I have no money for a small boat to get it.'
One evening, in Livorno, the captain asked Dantes to come to an important meeting.
Edmond went with the captain to see other ships' captains. They talked about a ship from Turkey which was carrying expensive cloth. They wanted to find a quiet place and meet this ship, buy the cloth and then take it to the coast of France.
'We need a quiet place where there are no customs officers,' one man said. 'A place where nobody will see us.'
'The best place is the island of Monte Cristo,' said the captain of the Young Amelia. 'Nobody lives on the island, and no customs officers ever go there.' They decided to sail to Monte Cristo the next night.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
490,"By a lucky accident, Dantes reached the island of Monte Cristo. Dantes was the first person to reach the shore.
The men knew the island well. Dantes questioned Jacopo, the man who saved him from the sea.
'Where shall we spend the night?'
'On the ship, of course.'
'I must find the place where Spada hid the treasure,' Dantes thought. 'There is an opening somewhere — but where? Perhaps Spada hid it with stones, or perhaps it is now covered with trees and plants. But I must wait for the morning.'
Next morning, the men rested. When Dantes quietly walked away. He climbed high until the men on the shore looked very small. Then he found a path that was cut by a stream between two walls of rock. He followed it.
'The treasure is near here,' he thought.",the count of monte cristo,2,Intermediate,2
491,"Dantes gave fine presents to all the men. He gave a new ship and some money to his best friend, Jacopo. After that, he left Livorno and went to Genoa.
In Genoa he saw a boat builder. The man had a beautiful little ship on the water.
'I built this boat for an Englishman,' the boat builder said.
It was very small.
'I can sail it myself, alone, without help,' Dantes thought. 'And it is very fast. No other ship on the water will catch it.'
Dantes offered a lot of money for the boat and asked the builder for the ship's papers.
'The Englishman will not return for some time,' the boat builder said. 'I am sure that I can build another boat for him.'
Dantes said, 'Make me a hidden place on the ship, near the top of my bed.'
The builder promised to do the work the next day.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
492,"One fine morning, a small beautiful boat sailed into Marseilles. 'I left Marseilles just here, many years ago,' he thought.
The customs officers came on board to look at the ship's papers.
A soldier stood near the steps. Even now, Dantes was afraid when he saw a soldier. Edmond now had a different name — a rich man's name. He showed the officers the ship's papers.
'This boat is owned by the Count of Monte Cristo,' the papers said.
'The count can go on shore now, if he wants to,' they said. 'There is no problem with his papers.'
Old Nicolas, a seaman from the Pharaoh, was one of the first men that he met on shore. Dantes went straight to Nicolas and asked him a number of questions. He watched the man's face carefully, but Nicolas did not know him. Dantes gave him some money and turned away.",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

On the day of Edmond's wedding, he is taken to the prison at the Chateau d'If and thrown into a dark, frightening underground room. Is this the end of his life as a free man?
Another prisoner, Faria, tells Edmond about some treasure on the island of Monte Cristo.

There, a man told him about some treasure hidden in Italy. When the shoemaker left prison, he found the treasure. He became a rich man.
In 1844 Dumas wrote another famous story, The Three Musketeers, about France in the 1600s. His stories were very popular because they were full of brave men, beautiful women, dangerous adventures and excitement. Dumas wrote more than 1,200 books before he died in France in 1870.

He returned to the treasure place and went into the second room. He took gold and some coins and hid them safely in his clothing. Then he covered the chest with earth, and put sand over the place.
'Nobody can see anything now,' he thought. He put a large stone over the opening and covered it with earth.
He waited for his friends to return. That was not easy. He did not want to sit and guard his great treasure. He wanted to return and live with men.

It was dark, but he saw the old, white-faced man holding on to the end of his bed in great pain.
'Ah, my dear friend,' said Faria. You know that the time has come.'
'Don't say that!' cried Dantes. I will save you again.'
He quickly lifted up the foot of the bed and took out the little bottle. There was still some red liquid in it.
'Look,' he cried. 'There is still some in here. Tell me what to do.'
'There is no hope,' Faria replied. 'But you can try to save my life. Do the same thing, but don't wait too long. If I don't get better, pour the rest into my mouth. Now put me on my bed.'",the count of monte cristo,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Dantes felt the night air on his face. He began to swim under the water because he did not want the guards to see him.
When he came up again, he was nearly a hundred metres from the prison. Above him, he saw a black and stormy sky. In front of him lay the great black sea. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the clouds, stood the Chateau d'If. It was a large and terrible place. The rocks around it seemed to reach out to take him back.

498,"When Dantes came up again, he could not see the light. He began to swim out to sea. He swam for hours; he was trying to reach an island.
'In two or three hours,' he thought, 'the guard will go into my room. He will find the body of my poor friend. He will look for me and not find me, and then he will call for help. The soldiers will discover underground path. They will question the men who threw me into the sea. They will send boats of soldiers to find the escaped prisoner.

It came near him. He shouted and waved his hand. The ship turned towards him, and let down a boat.
There were two men in the boat. Dantes began to swim to it, but he was too weak. He gave a cry, and one of the men in the boat shouted, 'Be strong! We are coming!'
Dantes heard their words. A wave passed over him. He came up to the top of the water, and then he went down again. The water closed over his head.
'I am dying!' he thought.

When he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he thought he was too early, so went over to the station house.

'Well, you'd better question the girl,' said the stationmaster carelessly. 'I dare say she'll be able to explain— she's got a tongue of her own, that's certain.

She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and gray in others.

560,"Ian Lancaster Fleming was born on the 28th of May 1908 in Canterbury, England. He was a newspaper journalist and a writer. He created one of the most famous characters in twentieth-century fiction - James Bond.
Ian Fleming was educated at Eton - a famous school for boys. After he left Eton, he trained to be a soldier at Sandhurst Military Academy, but he left after a short time and went to Europe. He studied languages at Munich and Geneva universities.
Fleming's first job was as a journalist in Russia. While he worked a news agency called Reuters, he heard about spies who sold government secrets to other countries. Fleming sent reports about these spies and their special investigations to Reuters in London. When he returned to London, he worked first as a banker and then as a broker.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
561,"During the Second World War, Ian Fleming was an officer in the British navy. He worked in the Department of Naval Intelligence. He became the assistant to the highest official who employed spies for Britain. Part of Fleming's training involved underwater swimming and fixing a limpet mines to the bottom of a ship. This is something that James Bond has to do in one of the final chapters of Live and Let Die. After the war, Fleming worked for The Sunday Times newspaper.
Fleming decided to become a writer during the war. He wrote about spies and dangerous criminals. In 1952, he completed his first novel. In the same year, he married Anne Rothermere. He was 44 years old. Fleming's first novel - Casino Royale - was about a handsome British secret agent called James Bond.",james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2
562,"One morning, James Bond was called to the office of his boss, M, head of the British Secret Service. Miss Moneypenny, M's private secretary, gave Bond a warm smile when he arrived.
'007 is here now, Sir,' she said into the intercom on her desk.
'Send him in,' came the reply.
Bond knocked and walked into M 's office. M was sitting behind a large leather-topped desk. A reading light made a pool of light across the desk. The rest of the room was darkened by the London fog outside the windows.
'Good morning, 007,' said M. 'Sit down.' Bond sat in the chair which faced M across the desk. 'Have you ever seen one of these?' M took a gold coin from his pocket and pushed it halfway across the desk towards Bond.
Bond picked it up and turned it over in his hand. 'No,' he said.",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
563,"M took gold coins from his pocket and dropped them on the desk in front of Bond - Spanish, French and Dutch coins. 'They're worth a lot of money just as gold, but much more to people who collect coins. If you take a look, you'll notice that they were all made before 1650. Bloody Morgan, the pirate, was Governor and Commander in Chief of Jamaica from 1675 to 1688. These coins are almost certainly part of Morgan's treasure. 'Nearly a thousand of them have come into the United States in the last few months. And they continue to come in, finding their way to banks and coin collectors' shops. But the FBI has a problem. If they admit that they know about the coins, the coins will stop coming into the country. They'll be melted down into gold bars and will be lost. They don't want that to happen.",james bond part 1,3,Intermediate,2
564,"'At the moment, someone is using a network of people - people who are working as porters or truck drivers - to spread the coins all across the United States. Quite innocent people, like Zachary Smith.' M opened a file which had TOP SECRET written on it and took out a piece of paper. Smith sold four sixteenth- and seventeenth-century gold coins to Fein Jewels in Lennox Avenue for one hundred dollars. When interviewed later, Smith said they had been sold to him in a Harlem bar for twenty dollars each. The seller was a black man he had never seen before. He told Smith that the coins were each worth fifty dollars. But Smith wanted cash immediately, so he was happy to sell them to Fein Jewels for twenty-five dollars each.' M put the paper back into the file. 'All the sales have been in Harlem or Florida.'",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
565,"A pleasant-looking man met Bond at Idlewild Airport in New York. 'My name's Halloran,' he said. 'I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Bond. Would you follow me?' Outside the airport building, a large black Buick car was waiting. Halloran and Bond climbed into it and the driver took them towards the centre of Manhattan. After a time, they stopped outside the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of 5th Avenue and 55th Street. A middle-aged man in a dark blue coat and a black hat came out to meet them.
Halloran said, 'Mr Bond, this is my boss, Captain Dexter. Can I leave him with you now, Captain?' 'Sure,' said Dexter. 'Ask for his bags to be sent up to Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go with Mr Bond and see that he has everything he wants.",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
566,"Bond turned to say goodbye to Halloran. Across 55th Street was a black Chevrolet car. Bond saw it suddenly move out into the busy traffic. The driver was a black woman wearing a chauffeur's uniform. For a moment, Bond also saw the passenger in the back seat of the car. Just before the car rushed away, the huge grey-black face turned slowly and looked back at Bond through the back window. Was this the face of Mr Big?
Bond followed Captain Dexter inside the hotel and into the lift. They got out at the twenty-first floor and walked to Room 2100. Dexter unlocked the door.
The room was an expensive-looking sitting room with comfortable chairs, light grey walls and a long sideboard. This low cupboard had several bottles of drink and glasses on it. The January sunshine shone through a wide window.",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
567,"At that moment, the bedroom door opened and a tall, thin young man with blond hair came into the room. He had a wide smile on his face. Bond stared at him in surprise.
'Felix Leiter!' said Bond. 'What are you doing here?' He shook the other man's hand warmly. 'Are you on this job?' Leiter smiled. 'The CIA thought we did well on that casino job, James, so yes, here I am. I'm the link between the CIA and our friends of the FBI.' He nodded his head towards Captain Dexter, who did not look especially pleased about it. 'It's the FBI's case here in America, but the CIA is interested in the Jamaican part of the job.
They sat down and Leiter gave Bond a large glass. As Bond started to drink his martini, Captain Dexter said, 'Now, Mr Bond, tell us what you know about this case.'",james bond part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
568,"The morning after his arrival in New York, Bond woke up in his bedroom at the St Regis.
Dexter had given him plenty of information about Mr Big. He was 45 years old, had been born in Haiti and was half black and half French. The gangster had got his name because of his large size and because of the initials of his full name: Buonaparte Ignace Gallia - B-I-G. After moving to America, he had various different jobs. Then he was forced to join the American armed forces during the Second World War. Because of his excellent French, he worked for the American Secret Service in France, where he worked closely with a Russian spy who was doing a similar job. After the war he disappeared for five years. He returned to Harlem in 1950. He soon became a man to fear.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
569,"People who went against Mr Big were murdered or mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again. Those who did not listen to his instructions had their homes burnt down or their families threatened. Naturally, all this helped to make Mr Big a very powerful man. Very soon he had large criminal organizations working for him, with his own spies everywhere. They were all ready at a moment's notice to report back to him what they had seen.
Bond had questioned Dexter and Leiter very closely about Mr Big. He was now almost certain that Mr Big was a leader of a huge spy organization. But the porters, the truck drivers and all the other men who passed on information to him didn't know much about him. Fear of death and cruelty was enough to stop them asking questions.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
570,"Bond picked up the telephone and asked for breakfast to be sent to his room. Then he collected the newspapers and parcels that had been put quietly on his hall table earlier that morning. Yesterday afternoon, a man had come and measured him for two dark blue suits. Another man had brought some uncomfortable white shirts with long points to the collars. He had also had to accept six unusually bright and patterned ties, some dark socks with large patterns on them, a plain grey hat, and two pairs of hand-made, black casual shoes. To hold all of these things, there was a light-weight American suitcase. He was allowed to keep his own Beretta .25 gun and shoulder holster. His other things were going to be collected at midday. They would be sent on to Jamaica to wait for him.",james bond part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
571,"It was all part of the Americanization of Bond, ordered by the FBI. His dark hair was now shorter and he had been told that he was from Boston, New England, and was visiting New York during his holidays. Bond had a shower and dressed. Later, in a white shirt and blue trousers, he opened the door for the waiter. The man brought in Bond's breakfast, together with a brown parcel about a foot square. Bond told the waiter to put the parcel on the sideboard. Something else from Leiter, he guessed. It was only after he had finished eating that he heard the very soft ticking noise. It was coming from the sideboard. Tick-tock ... Bond immediately dived to the floor behind an armchair. He waited nervously. Crack! The parcel exploded and fell to the floor.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
572,"Bond looked over the back of the armchair. The glasses and bottles on the sideboard were broken, and there was a black mark from smoke on the wall behind them. He got up slowly and went straight to the window and opened it. Then he picked up the phone and called Dexter. Soon after, there was a knock on the door.
'Who is it?' Bond called.
'Dexter.' Dexter came in, followed by a young man with a black box under his arm. The young man at once went down on his knees beside what was left of the parcel. He opened his box and put on some special gloves to protect his hands. Then he began to collect small bits of metal and glass from the carpet. Also lying on the carpet was a small metal tube. From it, the young man took out a piece of paper.",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
573,"Bond spent the morning on 5th Avenue and on Broadway, looking in shop windows and watching the passing crowds. He had lunch at a restaurant on Lexington Avenue, then took a taxi to the police headquarters in the centre of New York. He had arranged to meet Leiter and Dexter there at two thirty. A Lieutenant Binswanger of Homicide showed them Mr Big's police record and the reports about the Secatur yacht. The boat had often sailed into St Petersburg over the last six months. It always stopped at the jetty of the 'Ourobouros Worm and Bait Shippers' - a company whose main business was to sell live bait to fishing clubs in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It also sold seashells, coral and aquarium fish.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
574,"According to the manager of Ourobouros, the Secatur did big business with his company and brought in shells and tropical fish from Jamaica. These were bought and then stored in the Ourobouros warehouse. Later, the shells and fish were sold to shops up and down the coast.
As they were leaving his office, Lieutenant Binswanger said, 'More gold has been coming in recently. About a hundred coins a week in Harlem and New York alone. Do you want us to do anything about it?' 'The boss says not yet,' Dexter told him.
When Bond, Dexter and Leiter were out on the pavement, Dexter said, 'I had some instructions from Washington this morning. I've got to look after the Harlem side of the case, and you two have been asked to go down to St Petersburg tomorrow.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
575,"'If you don't mind, Leiter and I would like to go to Harlem this evening and have a look round,' said Bond.
Dexter thought for a moment.
'OK,' he said. 'But don't get hurt. There's no one to help you up there. And don't make trouble for us with Mr Big. Until we're ready to get him, we say ""live and let live"".' Bond smiled. 'In my job, when I meet a man like Mr Big, I have another saying. It's ""live and let die"".' 'Maybe,' said Dexter. 'But you take my orders while you're here, Mr Bond.' He waved his hand to stop a passing taxi. The yellow car stopped, Dexter got in and then Bond and Leiter watched the car drive away.
'Well, what about going to Harlem tonight, Felix?' asked Bond.
'Sure,' said Leiter. 'I'll meet you in the King Cole Bar of the St Regis at six thirty.'",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
576,"At six o'clock, Bond had a cold shower and dressed carefully. He wore a white shirt and put his leather shoulder holster on top of it. Next he put his Beretta into the holster. He looked at the casual shoes the FBI had given him. Then he reached under the bed and pulled out a pair of his own shoes and put them on. Under the leather, the toecaps were made of steel. At twenty-five past six, he went down to the King Cole Bar. A few minutes later, Felix Leiter came in and sat down. His head of yellow hair was now coloured black and he wore a bright blue suit with a white shirt and a black-and-white spotted tie.
'Mr Big's people may have my description,' Leiter said, and gave Bond a big smile. 'We'll catch a bus on 5th Avenue.You won't find many cabs that want to go to Harlem after it's dark.'",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
577,"Three men waited at the bus stop on the comer of 5th Avenue and Cathedral Parkway. They had been watching the traffic on 5th Avenue since four thirty, but now a bus stopped and one of the men got on it. He saw the two white men and sat down on a seat behind them. He had been given descriptions and he recognized Bond, but not the other man.
At the next stop, he got off the bus and hurried to the nearest public phone. The Whisper questioned him urgently, then immediately started to pass on the information.
'Boss, the Englishman is on a bus on 5th Avenue. He's got a friend with him.' The Whisper then described Leiter.
'They're both coming north.' 'Warn the clubs and get this information to others, ' said the voice at the other end of the line.",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4
578,"From the moment Bond and Leiter walked into Sugar Ray's club on 7th Avenue, there was a team of men and women watching them or waiting to watch them. These men and women reported what they saw to The Whisper. The famous nightclub was crowded, and the walls were covered with pictures of Sugar Ray Robinson, the famous boxer. Bond and Leiter found an empty table, sat down and ordered drinks.
As Bond was paying the waiter, Leiter said suddenly, 'Do you know where Mr Big is tonight?' The waiter's eyes opened wide. He moved close to Leiter.
'I've got a wife and kids, Sir,' he said out of the corner of his mouth.
'Don't ask me that.' Then he hurried away.
'Mr Big's got the best protection of all,' said Leiter. 'Fear.'",james bond part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
579,"Bond and Leiter finished their drinks and went out onto 7th Avenue. The rain had stopped but there was an icy-cold wind. They moved along with the other people on the pavement, but the looks they were given were not friendly. The streets were dirty and many of the buildings were dark and unwelcoming. Bond wondered what secrets were held behind some of the closed doors.
'We'll go to Ma Frazier's, further up the Avenue,' said Leiter.
'It has the best food in Harlem.' They had an excellent meal of Fried Chicken Maryland with bacon and sweetcorn.
But when Leiter asked the waiter about Mr Big, the man pretended not to hear. When they had finished eating and Bond was paying the bill, Leiter tried again.
'Sorry, Sir,' said the waiter. 'I don't remember anyone with that name.'",james bond part 1,3,Advanced,4

Bond thought many of the girls were very beautiful and he found the music exciting. He almost forgot what he was there for.
'Great, isn't it?' said Leiter. 'But we'd better move on. I'll have a walk around while you pay for the drinks. I'll see if I can get any information about where Mr Big is. We don't want to have to go to all his places.' They met outside the entrance a few minutes later, then walked up the street looking for a taxi.

Bond looked round. It was not a large room, but there were about fifty tables and about two hundred people. The music stopped. The four-man band carried their musical instruments away, and the red light under the glass dance floor was turned off. Instead, pencil-thin lights in the roof came on and shone on coloured glass balls that hung around the walls - yellow, blue and red.
There were calls of 'Where's G-G?' and 'Come on, G -G !' from the crowd.
Suddenly, the MC came out onto the dance floor. A single white light shone down on him as the rest of the room went dark. There was silence.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

When he turned round, blood was pouring out of it.
The man giving the orders spoke to Bond's guard.
'Take him away. Mr Big's waiting.' He turned to Bond.
'Say goodbye to your friend. You probably won't see each other again.' Bond smiled at Leiter.
'See you later,' he said.

'You can go in, Tee-Hee,' said the man with the gun.
Tee-Hee knocked on a door in front of them, opened it and then took Bond into the room. Mr Big sat behind an expensive desk, his huge head resting against the back of his chair. It was a great football of a head, twice the normal size and very nearly round.
There was nothing on the desk except an intercom with about twenty buttons and a very small riding whip. Bond's guard led him across the thick carpet to a low chair. Bond sat down and faced the man across the desk.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
604,"The woman got a chair and sat down near Bond. Her blue eyes looked into his, and they seemed to have some sort of message for him.
The silent message was clear, and a warm smile must have appeared on Bond's face. Suddenly, Mr Big picked up the riding whip from the desk and hit the girl cruelly across her shoulders.
'Sit up!' he said. She sat up slowly.
At no time did she look at Bond, but now he was sure that he had a friend.
'Are you ready, Solitaire?' asked Mr Big.
Bond looked into her eyes and repeated what he had said earlier. Did the woman know that he was not telling the whole truth? If she did, would she speak for him or against him?
For a moment there was silence. She looked at Mr Big. 'He speaks the truth,' she said coldly.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
605,"In his hotel room, Bond poured himself a whisky and then used the telephone. Leiter answered at once.
'Thank God, you're alive!' he said. 'Are you hurt?' 'Broken finger,' said Bond. 'What about you?' 'Nothing serious. Blabbermouth and I got quite friendly. I got him talking about movies and music until instructions came from Mr Big. Then he said ""Sorry, mister,"" knocked me out and took me to Bellevue Hospital. He left me outside.

'Mr Big wants the police to do something about it, but I talked to them and the FBI. They're not going to chase after us.
Now, tell me exactly what happened to you.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
606,"Bond told his story.
When he had finished, Leiter said, 'That Solitaire lady certainly seems to be your friend. We need to make plans.
Listen, I'll phone you again in a few minutes. First I'll get the police doctor to come and see you. While you're waiting, you'd better call your boss in London.' Ten minutes later, Bond was speaking to M. He chose his words carefully. He knew that someone might be listening to the conversation. 'It's James, Sir,' he said. 'I may need a bit of help. I went across town to see our main customer last night.
Three of his best men became sick while I was there.' 'Did you get sick?' 'Only a little, Sir,' said Bond. 'But Federated thinks I'll feel better away from town.' Bond smiled. M would know that 'Federated' was the FBI.' Bond put down the telephone and grinned.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
607,"""Bond walked into his bedroom and somehow got out of his clothes. He gave himself a very hot shower and then an ice-cold one. He shaved and managed to pull on a clean shirt and trousers. He put a fresh clip in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through his packing when the telephone rang.
He listened to the zing and echo on the line. He could see the big, grey building near Regent's Park and imagine the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl saying, 'Yes, this is Universal Export,' the address Bond had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for emergency calls on open lines from abroad. She would tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over.""",james bond part 2,3,Advanced,4
608,"Bond could imagine M explaining the news to the Chief of Staff. '007's already upset the FBI,' he would say. 'The fool went up to Harlem and killed three of Mr Big's men. He got hurt himself, but only a little.
He's got to get out of New York with Leiter, the CIA man. They're going down to St Petersburg. Washington will be complaining to us in a minute. Apologize and tell them that it won't happen again.' Bond's telephone rang. It was Leiter again.
'Everyone's calmer now,' he told Bond. 'The three men you killed were Tee-Hee Johnson, Sam Miami and a man called McThing. The police wanted all of them for different crimes. The FBI wants you to be sent home, so we'd better get out of town quickly. We can't go together, so you're going on the train and I'll fly.'",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
609,"'This is Solitaire. Listen, I've got to be quick. You must trust me. I've got to get away, and so must you. You've got to take me. I can help you - I know a lot of his secrets. But be quick. If he finds out I called you, he'll kill me. Please, you must trust me!' Bond said nothing for a moment. He was thinking fast. Then he said, 'OK, write this down. Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten twenty exactly. The Silver Phantom to ... to Washington. Pullman Car 245, Compartment H. Say that you're Mrs Bryce.
The conductor will have the ticket if I'm not already there. Go straight to the compartment and wait for me.' 'Thank you, thank you!' said Solitaire. 'Now I must go.' Bond put down the telephone. 'That's going to make things interesting,' he said to himself, smiling.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
610,"Bond left the hotel through a back door and got a taxi to Pennsylvania Station. One of Mr Big's spies saw him when he got out of the taxi. The man hurried to a telephone. Some minutes later, a waiter in the train's dining car was replaced by another man. This man had been given full and careful instructions on the telephone.
The Silver Phantom was a long train of silver carriages. It stood quietly in the half-light of the underground station. There were not many passengers. More would get on at Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. Pullman Car 245 was near the back of the train. A porter stood at the door. His black face was bored but friendly.
'Compartment H,' said Bond.
'Mr Bryce?' said the porter. 'Mrs Bryce has just arrived. Go to the end of the carriage.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
611,"Bond stepped onto the train. A notice said: 'If you need anything, ring for your Pullman Porter, Samuel D. Baldwin.' Compartment H was more than halfway down the carriage. There was an American couple in Compartment E, but all the other rooms were empty. The door of Compartment H was locked. Bond knocked.
'Who's that?' asked a woman's voice nervously.
'It's me,' said Bond.
The door opened. Bond walked through and locked the door behind him. Solitaire wore a black suit and her eyes were wide with fear. She looked beautiful.
Bond looked round the room. Then he opened the bathroom door and looked in. It was empty. Moments later, the train began to move. He sat down on a seat with his back to the engine.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
612,"'Mr Big was certain you'd travel to Florida. I heard him warning his people down there about you. He told them to watch the airport at Tampa and the trains. Perhaps we should get off the train earlier, at one of the small stations up the coast. Did they see you get on the train?' 'I don't think so,' said Bond. He was calm again. 'Did you have any trouble getting away?' 'It was my day for a singing lesson,' she said. 'Mr Big wants me to be a singer at The Boneyard. One of his men took me to my teacher and he'll be there to collect me at midday.' She looked at her watch. 'They'll be looking for me in about an hour. I waited until the car had gone, then telephoned you. Next I got a cab and went into the city. All I've got with me is my jewelry and about five thousand dollars of my own money.'",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
613,"Bond rang for the train attendant and the man started to get their beds ready. He seemed worried about something and he pretended to find it difficult to move around in the small compartment. At last he said, 'Perhaps Mrs Bryce would like to go to the next room while I finish this. It's empty all the way to St Petersburg.' He unlocked the inside door to the next compartment without waiting for an answer.
Bond nodded to Solitaire, and she went through the door. Bond remembered the porter's name and said, 'Is there something you want to tell me, Baldwin?' 'Yes, Sir, Mr Bryce,' said the attendant nervously. 'You've got an enemy on this train.
You need to be careful.' He took two small pieces of wood from his pocket. 'Push these under the doors to stop them opening.'",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
614,"The train travelled on through the bright afternoon. They left Pennsylvania behind, and Maryland. They stopped at Washington, then went on into Virginia. Bond woke up at seven o'clock.
They had dinner, and at nine o'clock Baldwin саmе to take the dishes away.
'What time do we get into Jacksonville?' Bond asked him.
'About five o'clock in the morning, Sir,' said Baldwin.
'Is there a subway at the station?' asked Bond.
'Yes, Sir, this carriage stops next to it,' replied Baldwin.
'Can you have the door open and the steps down quickly?' said Bond.
'Yes, Sir. I can do that,' Baldwin said. Bond gave him ten dollars.
After the attendant had left, Bond put the pieces of wood back under the doors. He told Solitaire of the warning Baldwin had given him earlier.",james bond part 2,3,Advanced,4
615,"Bond checked the pieces of wood under the doors, then took off his tie and lay down on the bottom bed. He lay thinking about Solitaire and listening to the sound of the train. Soon it was eleven o'clock, and they were travelling between Columbia and Savannah, Georgia. It would be another six hours before they were in Jacksonville.
Mr Big had probably told his man on the train to try to kill Bond during the night, while everyone was asleep and the corridors were empty. Bond read for a while, then turned off his light and thought about Solitaire and the future. He was half asleep when he heard someone trying to unlock the door of their compartment. Bond saw a man running fast towards the end of the carriage, but he could not get his gun out quickly enough to shoot.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2
616,"The door to the corridor was locked. The room was identical to theirs. Bond went over it very carefully for vulnerable points. There was only the air-conditioning vent in the ceiling and Bond, who was prepared to consider any possibility, dismissed the employment of gas in the system. It would slay all the other occupants of the car. There only remained the waste pipes in the small lavatory, and while these certainly could be used to insert some death-dealing medium from the underbelly of the train, the operator would have to be a daring and skilled acrobat. There was no ventilating grille into the corridor.
Bond shrugged his shoulders. If anyone came, it would be through the doors. He would just have to stay awake.",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
617,"It was five o'clock in the morning when Bond and Solitaire got off the train at Jacksonville. It was still dark and there were very few lights on in the station. The entrance to the subway was near Car 245, and there was nobody around when they ran down the steps. Bond had told Baldwin to keep the door of their compartment locked after they had left. With luck, no one would know they had gone until the train reached St Petersburg. Bond checked and found that the next train to St. Petersburg was The Silver Meteor. It would leave Jacksonville at nine o'clock that morning. He and Solitaire walked out into the warm, dark street and found an all-night restaurant. They had breakfast and talked.",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
618,"Why did Mr Big choose this place to operate from?'
'It's perfect for him,' said Solitaire seriously. 'There's practically no crime, except cheating at bridge and Canasta. So there's a very small police force. There's quite a big Coastguard Station but it's mainly concerned with smuggling between Tampa and Cuba, and sponge-fishing out of season at Tarpon Springs. I don't really know what he does there except that he's got a big agent called ""The Robber"". Something to do with Cuba, I expect,' she added thoughtfully. 'Probably mixed up with Communism. I believe Cuba comes under Harlem and runs red agents all through the Caribbean.
'Anyway,' she went on, 'this city is probably the most innocent town in America. Everything's very ""folksy"" and ""gracious"".",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
619,"Bond and Solitaire got out of the taxi at a group of small white-and-yellow beach houses called The Everglades.
The two of them went through a door with the word 'Office' on it. The woman behind the desk had blue-grey hair. She smiled.
'Yes?' 'Mr Leiter?' said Bond.
'You're Mr Bryce. Mr Leiter's been waiting for you.' She took them down a path to a cottage and knocked on the door. Leiter opened it. His mouth fell open in surprise when he saw Bond.
'This is my wife,' Bond said quickly.
'Oh - yes, hello,' said Leiter.
He almost pulled the two of them into the cottage, then shut the door before Mrs Stuyvesant could speak.
A small living room looked across the beach to the sea. It had comfortable beach chairs and a large table with a glass top. There was a white telephone and some flowers on the table.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
620,"By the time they left the restaurant, it was ten thirty. Bond and Leiter took a taxi to the Savoy Ballroom, where they had drinks and watched the dancers in the huge, crowded hall. They found the music exciting.",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
621,"At twelve forty-five, Bond and Leiter paid their taxi driver and walked into The Boneyard. The head waiter met them and took them to a table in the comer of the club by the small, crowded dance floor.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
622,"Bond looked round. It was not a large room, but there were about fifty tables and about two hundred people. The music stopped. The four-man band carried their musical instruments away, and the red light under the glass dance floor was turned off.",james bond part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
623,"Bond was pulled up onto his feet. He had one foot under a leg of the table and he pulled it hard. There was a crash of glass. At the same moment, Leiter kicked backwards behind his chair. His foot hit his guard's leg.",james bond part 2,3,Advanced,4
624,"Bond was taken through several doors to a large warehouse by his guard and Tee-Hee. They walked across the warehouse floor to a metal door, and Tee-Hee rang a bell. After a moment, the door opened.",james bond part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
625,"The woman got a chair and sat down near Bond. Her blue eyes looked into his, and they seemed to have some sort of message for him. The silent message was clear, and a warm smile must have appeared on Bond's face.",james bond part 2,3,Intermediate,2

640,"Bond and Solitaire sat down and Bond lit a cigarette. He put the pack on the table. Leiter was still staring at them, his eyes wide with surprise, unable to speak. Suddenly, the telephone rang and Leiter picked it up.
'Is that you, Lieutenant?' he said. 'Yes ... He's here. He's just arrived.' He listened for a moment, then turned to Bond.
'Where did you leave the train?' Bond told him. 'Jacksonville,' Leiter said into the phone. 'Yes, I'll get the information from him and phone you later.' He put down the telephone and sat down opposite Bond.
He looked at Solitaire. 'I guess you're Solitaire,' he said, and smiled at her.
'She's working with us now,' Bond told him.
'That's great,' said Leiter. '",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3

'They definitely get into the USA through St Petersburg,' said Leiter. 'It comes straight from Jamaica and always stops at that factory. What's it called?' 'Ourobouros,' said Bond.
'Let's go and see the place,' said Leiter. ' And let's go and see if we can have a look at Mr Big's robber. Go and tell Solitaire to stay here until we get back, then we'll take her out to dinner.' But Solitaire did not want to be left alone.
'I want to get away from here,' she told him with fear in her eyes.
Bond kissed her.
'It's all right,' he said. 'We'll be back in an hour. Nothing can happen to you here. Then I won't leave you until you're on the plane.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
642,"Solitaire was not in the cottage and the lock of her room had been broken. Bond swore angrily to himself. He should not have left her alone. The two men had probably been carrying guns. Bond imagined the fear Solitaire must have felt as they put her in the wooden box. But how had Mr Big found her so fast? It was just another example of the fact that Mr Big's spies were everywhere.
Leiter was speaking to the FBI on the telephone. When he put the phone down, he said, 'They're sending two of their men here. I'll talk to Washington and New York.' Bond went back into Solitaire's room. Her things were still there, and he found her bag under the bed. He looked inside it and found the five thousand dollars. Bond put them into his pocket. The money would be safe with him.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
643,"Bond did not wait. He telephoned for a taxi. He got dressed and was just about to leave to go to the warehouse when the telephone rang. He picked it up.
'Mr Bryce? This is Mound Park Hospital speaking,' said a voice. 'We have a Mr Leiter here who is asking for you.' 'What happened?' asked Bond, full of fear. 'Is he all right?' 'A car accident, but it's not too serious,' said the voice. 'Can you come now?' Bond's taxi arrived and minutes later he was crossing the Treasure Island Causeway.
A nurse sat at the hospital desk. 'Yes?' she said.
'Doctor Roberts called me,' said Bond. 'I'm looking for a patient called Felix Leiter. He was brought in this morning.' 'There's no doctor called Roberts here,' said the nurse.
She looked down at a list on the desk. 'And there's no patient called Leiter.'",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
644,"At six o'clock, Bond paid his bill at The Everglades and left. Leiter's car had been returned and Bond drove it into the town. He visited a shop and bought several things, then found a restaurant. After dinner, he drove to the harbour and parked the car near the sea. It was a bright, moonlit night and he walked along by the low sea wall. The wall was about three feet wide, and Bond climbed up and walked on top of it. When he got close to the warehouse, he jumped off the wall into the parking space at the back of the building.
Above his head, the roof and top part of the south wall of the warehouse were all made of glass. There were open windows up on the roof, but they were too high for Bond to reach. He started working with a glass-cutter that he had bought at the shop.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
645,"After a quarter of an hour's careful work, Bond took out a large, square piece of the glass in front of him. Then he pulled himself through the hole in the glass and dropped onto one of the shelves of shells.
As quietly as he could, he made a space for his feet. A moment later, he was down on the floor. He left his shoes on the shelf, then moved across the floor with a small torch in his hand.
He walked slowly past tank after tank of coloured fish. Underneath these were trays of live worms and bait.
After a time, he found what he was looking for, the poisonous fish. Here the tanks were smaller, and there was only one fish in each tank. There must have been hundreds of these tanks. On the glass of each one was a sign saying VERY DANGEROUS or DON'T TOUCH.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
646,"Bond chose a tank which had a scorpion fish in it. He knew these did not attack, but they were poisonous when touched. He took out a pocket knife and opened the longest blade. He pulled up his shirt sleeve and put his arm into the tank.
He then pushed the knife blade quickly towards the centre of the fish's head. The knife went through it and Bond carefully removed the fish from the tank. He dropped it onto the floor. Next, he put his hand into the sand at the bottom of the tank. His fingers touched rows of coins in a flat tray. He pulled out a coin and shone his torch on it. It was gold, and it was Spanish.
Bond thought for a moment. There had to be a thousand coins in it.
'All very clever,' thought Bond.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
647,"Bond dropped the scorpion fish back into the tank. Suddenly, all the lights in the warehouse came on. A voice said, 'Don't move! Put your hands in the air!' Bond turned and threw himself under the tank. The Robber was about twenty yards away, pointing his rifle at him. There was a crack as The Robber fired a shot and the tank above Bond exploded like a bomb. Water poured down, but Bond had rolled into the next passageway. He quickly got up and ran. There was another shot and a second tank exploded near him.
He was now at the end of the warehouse where he had climbed in. The Robber was at the other end. Bond fired two shots from his Beretta as he quickly crossed the central passageway.
There was a crash of glass and water, a scream, and then The Robber was shooting again.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
648,"The Robber came towards Bond. When he was a few yards from Bond, he stopped. 'Put your hands up higher!' he shouted.
Bond lifted his hands across his face. Between his fingers, he saw The Robber move something on the floor with his foot. Suddenly, Bond guessed what had happened to Leiter, but there was no time to think about it now. The Robber moved nearer. At that moment, Bond dropped the gold coin from his left hand. The Robber looked down, and Bond moved quickly. He reached out with his right foot and the steel capped shoe almost kicked the rifle from the man's hands. At the same time, The Robber fired the gun. Bond threw himself at the man's stomach. The Robber began to fall backwards, and Bond kicked again with his steel capped shoe. The man screamed with pain and dropped his rifle.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
649,"Bond drove towards Tampa and stopped at a bar for a drink. He used the washroom to clean himself. The bandages on his left hand were dirty and his finger was very painful. He was very tired, but he got back into the car and drove towards the airport. He stopped at the first hotel that looked open and awake. It was two o'clock in the morning, and he went straight to bed. He woke up at midday and walked down the road to a cafe for a sandwich and a cup of coffee. Then he went back to his room and wrote a report for the FBI at Tampa. He said nothing in the report about the gold in the poisonous fish tanks - this would be Bond's secret. He did not want Mr Big to know he had seen the coins. Before he got on the plane, he telephoned the hospital. Leiter was no better, but no worse.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
650,"Bond awoke at midday and walked down the road to a cafeteria where the short-order cook fixed him a delicious three-decker western sandwich and coffee. Then he came back to his room and wrote a detailed report to the FBI at Tampa. He omitted all reference to the gold in the poison tanks for fear that The Big Man would close down his operations in Jamaica. The nature of these had still to be discovered. Bond knew that the damage he had done to the machine in America had no bearing on the heart of his assignment--the discovery of the source of the gold, its seizure, and the destruction, if possible, of Mr Big himself.
He drove to the airport and caught the silver, four-engined plane with a few minutes to spare. He left Leiter's car in the parking space as in his report he had told the FBI he would.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
651,"The telephone rang. Long Distance. Bond found himself speaking to the head of Leiter's Section of the Central Intelligence Agency. The gist of it was that they'd be very glad if Bond would move on to Jamaica at once. All very polite. They had spoken to London, who had agreed. When should they tell London that Bond would arrive in Jamaica?
Bond knew there was a Transcarib plane via Nassau due out next day. He said he'd be taking it. Any other news? Oh yes, said the CIA. The gentleman from Harlem and his girl friend had left by plane for Havana, Cuba, during the night. Private charter. Papers were in order and charter company was such a small one the FBI had not bothered to include them when they put the watch on all airports. Arrival had been reported by the CIA man in Cuba.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
652,"Bond noticed an FBI agent watching him at the airport. He was certain that the agent was there to make sure that Bond got on the plane. They would be glad to see the last of him. Wherever he had gone in America, he had left dead bodies.
The plane for Jamaica left at five o'clock. The sun was low in the sky as the plane flew round over Tampa Bay and then flew east. Soon they were over Miami. After an early dinner, the plane stopped at Nassau before flying on across Cuba and finally to Jamaica.
When Bond arrived at Palisadoes Airport, Strangways, the Chief Secret Service Agent for the Caribbean, was there to meet him. He was good-looking, thirty-five years old and wore a black patch over one eye. The two men spoke very little until they were sitting outside Strangways's attractive white house.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
653,"Bond went quickly through the Customs and Immigration and Finance Control. It was nearly eleven and the night was quiet and hot. There was the shrill sound of crickets from the dildo cactus on both sides of the airport road and Bond gratefully drank in the sounds and smells of the tropics as the military pick-up cut across the corner of Kingston and took them up towards the gleaming, moonlit foothills of the Blue Mountains.
Bond and Strangways talked in monosyllables until they were settled on the comfortable veranda of Strangways's neat white house on the Junction Road below Stony Hill.
Strangways poured some drinks for both of them and then gave a concise account of the whole of the Jamaica end of the case.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
654,"'There have always been stories about Morgan's treasure on the Isle of Surprise,' he explained. 'It's a small island in the centre of Shark Bay, where Morgan used to keep his ships. They say that when he left here for the last time in 1683, he hid his treasure somewhere in Jamaica. When he died, the secret of the treasure's hiding place on the island died with him.
'For two hundred years, treasure hunters found nothing. Then, six months ago, a New York company bought the island. People from this company said that they had come to collect shells and catch tropical fish for the Ourobouros company. One fisherman swam across there at night, planning to search for the treasure. He didn't come back and his body was never found. After that, nobody went near the island again. They were too frightened.'",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
655,"'It was about that time that I got interested,' Strangways continued. 'I sent a report to London and they discovered that the island belonged to Mr Big. This was about three months ago. I was told to find out what was really happening there, so I arranged for the island to be watched day and night. Nothing suspicious happened, so I got two good swimmers to make an underwater visit to the island. They didn't return, and their bodies appeared in different parts of the bay the next day. Or what the sharks had left of the bodies. Terrible. You can imagine how I felt about it.' 'I've got you a house at Beau Desert. You can see the island from there,' Strangways told Bond. 'I 've got you a car and a good man to work with you. His name's Quarrel and he's the best fisherman and swimmer in the Caribbean.'",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
656,"After breakfast the next morning, Strangways introduced Quarrel to Bond.
Bond liked him. After they had discussed their plans, the two men left in the little car Quarrel had brought with him. Strangways went to get the things that Bond needed for the job ahead. By half past ten, they were travelling down the little road that went to Shark Bay. The bay was C-shaped, and in the centre was the Isle of Surprise. Quarrel pointed towards the little buildings on the top of the island. There were trees all around them, and Bond looked at them carefully through Quarrel's binoculars. Then Quarrel pointed to Beau Desert, in the middle of the western side of the 'C '.
'That's where we'll work from,' he said.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
657,"It was two o'clock in the morning. Bond eased his car away from the sea-wall and moved off through the town on to 4th Street, the highway to Tampa.
Bond stopped at the Gulf Winds Bar and Snacks and ordered a double Old Grandad on the rocks. While the barman poured it he went into the washroom and cleaned himself up. The bandages on his left hand were covered with dirt and the hand throbbed painfully. There was nothing Bond could do about it. His eyes were red with strain and lack of sleep. He went back to the bar. The barman looked like a college kid spending his holidays the hard way. He wanted to talk but there was no talk left in Bond. Bond sat and looked into his glass and thought about Leiter and The Robber.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
658,"They drove back onto the main coast road and stopped for lunch on the other side of the wide bay. Then they drove to the western end of the island to the most beautiful beach Bond had ever seen. There was white sand reaching down to the sea and small fishermen's cottages with palm trees all around them.
This was where they were going to stay for the week before going to Beau Desert. Bond went for a swim while Quarrel went into the cottage and made it comfortable.
Later, when the stars and the moon shone down, the sound of the sea died to a whisper. There was the short silence between the two great winds of Jamaica, then the palm trees began to whisper again.
The next day Bond began his training. Every morning before breakfast, he swam a mile up the beach and then ran back along the sand.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
659,"At about nine o'clock, he and Quarrel would go out in a canoe. The single sail took them fast through the water, up the coast to Bloody Bay and Orange Bay.
Here they pulled the canoe up onto the beach and then went underwater hunting. Bond used a mask and an old harpoon gun.
'Fish don't usually attack a man,' Quarrel told him. 'Except the barracuda - a big, dangerous fish with very sharp teeth.' By the end of the week, Bond could swim two miles without feeling tired. His hand was completely better and he was sunburnt. Quarrel was pleased with him.
In the evening of the eighth day, they came back to the cottage to find Strangways waiting for them. He had good news for them. Felix Leiter had lost an arm and a leg, but he would not die.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
660,"Bond and Solitaire sat down and Bond lit a cigarette. He put the pack on the table. Leiter was still staring at them, his eyes wide with surprise, unable to speak. Suddenly, the telephone rang and Leiter picked it up.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
661,Solitaire was not in the cottage and the lock of her room had been broken. Bond swore angrily to himself. He should not have left her alone. The two men had probably been carrying guns. Bond imagined the fear Solitaire must have felt.,james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
662,"Leiter was speaking to the FBI on the telephone. Bond went back into Solitaire's room. Her things were still there, and he found her bag under the bed. He looked inside it and found the five thousand dollars.",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
663,"At six o'clock, Bond paid his bill and left. Leiter's car had been returned and Bond drove it into the town. He visited a shop and bought several things, then found a restaurant. After dinner, he drove to the harbour.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
664,"He parked the car near the sea. It was a bright, moonlit night and he walked along by the low sea wall. Bond climbed up the wall and walked on top of it. When he got close to the warehouse, he jumped off the wall.",james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
665,"Above his head, the roof and top part of the south wall of the warehouse were all made of glass. There were open windows up on the roof, but they were too high for Bond to reach. He started working with a glass-cutter that he had bought at the shop.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
666,"After a quarter of an hour's careful work, Bond took out a large, square piece of the glass in front of him. Then he pulled himself through the hole in the glass and dropped onto one of the shelves of shells.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
667,"As quietly as he could, Bond made a space for his feet. A moment later, he was down on the floor. He left his shoes on the shelf, then moved across the floor with a small torch in his hand. He walked slowly past tank after tank of coloured fish.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
668,"After a time, he found what he was looking for, the poisonous fish. Here the tanks were smaller, and there was only one fish in each tank. There must have been hundreds of these tanks. On the glass of each one was a sign saying VERY DANGEROUS or DON'T TOUCH.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
669,"Bond chose a tank which had a scorpion fish in it. He knew these did not attack, but they were poisonous. He took out a pocket knife and opened the longest blade. He pulled up his shirt sleeve and put his arm into the tank.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
670,"Bond pushed the knife blade towards the centre of the fish's head. Then Bond carefully removed the fish from the tank. He dropped it onto the floor. Next, he put his hand into the sand at the bottom of the tank.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
671,"Bond dropped the scorpion fish back into the tank. Suddenly, all the lights in the warehouse came on. Bond turned and threw himself under the tank. The Robber was about twenty yards away, pointing his rifle at him.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
672,"Water poured down, but Bond had rolled into the next passageway. He quickly got up and ran. There was another shot and a second tank exploded near him. He was now at the end of the warehouse where he had climbed in.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
673,"Bond lifted his hands across his face. Between his fingers, he saw The Robber move something on the floor with his foot. Suddenly, Bond guessed what had happened to Leiter, but there was no time to think about it now.",james bond part 3,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
674,"Bond drove towards Tampa and stopped at a bar for a drink. He used the washroom to clean himself. The bandages on his left hand were dirty and his finger was very painful. He was very tired, but he drove towards the airport.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
675,"Bond stopped at the first hotel that looked open and awake. It was two o'clock in the morning, and he went straight to bed. He woke up at midday and walked down the road to a cafe for a sandwich and a cup of coffee.",james bond part 3,3,Beginner,0
676,Then Bond went back to his room and wrote a report for the FBI at Tampa. He said nothing in the report about the gold in the poisonous fish tanks. This would be Bond's secret. He did not want Mr Big to know he had seen the coins.,james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
677,"Bond noticed an FBI agent watching him at the airport. He was certain that the agent was there to make sure that Bond got on the plane. They would be glad to see the last of him. Wherever he had gone in America, he had left dead bodies.",james bond part 3,3,Advanced,4
678,"The plane for Jamaica left at five o'clock. The sun was low in the sky as the plane flew round over Tampa Bay and then flew east. Soon they were over Miami. After an early dinner, the plane stopped at Nassau.",james bond part 3,3,Intermediate,2
679,When Bond arrived Strangways was there to meet him. He was good-looking and wore a black patch over one eye. The two men spoke very little until they were sitting outside Strangways's attractive white house.,james bond part 3,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
680,"Mr Big is on board. Oh, and a girl called Solitaire is with him. Do you know anything about her?' 'Not much,' Bond said. 'But I'd like to get her away from him. She's not one of his team.' He went outside and looked up at the stars. There was a lot to think about and a lot to do. Discovering the secret of the treasure, killing a dangerous criminal - and rescuing Solitaire.
At six the next morning, Bond and Quarrel left for Beau Desert. They were there by ten thirty. There was a path between the trees that went down to the little beach house. From inside the house, Bond looked across at the island. The top half was hidden by trees, but the cliff looked grey and dangerous in the half shadow made by the hot sun.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
681,"Bond heard the door unlock. The girl came back and slid into the seat opposite him. She looked fresh and gay. She examined him carefully.
'You have been wondering about me,' she said. 'I felt it. Don't worry. There is nothing very bad to know. I will tell you all about it some day. When we have time. Now I want to forget about the past. I will just tell you my real name. It is Simone Latrelle, but you can call me what you like. I am twenty-five. And now I am happy. I like this little room. But I am hungry and sleepy.
Their lunch arrived, brought from the diner by a preoccupied negro waiter. He seemed anxious to be paid and get back to his work.
When they had finished and Bond rang for the Pullman porter, he also seemed distrait and avoided looking at Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
682,"After lunch, Bond looked at the things that had come from London. Strangways had sent them on from Kingston. Bond put on the black frogman's suit. It fitted him perfectly. He checked the air bottle, the harpoon gun, dagger and torch. Finally, there was the heavy limpet mine with some fuses. These were in a box with the word DANGER printed on top of it. At five o'clock, Strangways arrived with news.
'Mr Big and his gang come through Port Maria and will be here soon,' he said. 'Mr Big has a passport in the name of Gallia. The girl's passport is in the name of Simone Latrelle. There are more than a hundred empty fish tanks on board.' 'I'll go to the island tomorrow night,' Bond told him.
Quarrel came in from outside. 'The boat is coming in through the coral reef now, Captain.'",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4
683,"Bond, the collar of his new raincoat up round his ears, was missed as he came out of the entrance of the St Regis Drugstore on 55th Street, which has a connecting door into the hotel.
He waited in the entrance and leaped at a cruising cab, hooking the door open with the thumb of his injured hand and throwing his light suitcase in ahead of him. The cab hardly checked. The negro with the collecting-box for the Colored Veterans of Korea and his colleague fumbling under the bonnet of his stalled car stayed on the job until, much later, they were called off by a man who drove past and sounded two shorts and a long on his horn.
But Bond was immediately spotted as he left his cab at the drive-in to the Pennsylvania Station. A lounging negro with a wicker basket walked quickly into a call-box. It was ten-fifteen.",james bond part 4,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
684,"Bond and Strangways walked back up through the trees, leaving Quarrel to watch the yacht. They sat down in the living room. Bond stared out of the window, thinking. The moon was already in the sky, and the wind blew softly through the palm trees. He had travelled two thousand miles for this, but suddenly he hated and feared the sea, and everything in it. And in a few hours, he would walk alone under that black sheet of water. Quarrel came in soon after.
'They're working with lights now, Captain,' he said. 'A tank every five minutes. I guess that'll be ten hours work. They'll finish at about four in the morning, but won't sail before six. It would be too dangerous to leave earlier. It needs to be light for them to find their way through the coral reef.'",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4
685,"'I'll start at ten o'clock tonight,' said Bond. 'I'll go from the rocks at the left of the beach. Can you get us some dinner and then get the things I need out onto the beach?' Quarrel left the room, and Bond turned to Strangways.
'Now, tell me what they usually do when they're ready to sail,' he said. 'How long does it take them to get away from the island? If it's the last trip, they'll leave with extra men.' Listening carefully to Strangways, Bond suddenly felt strong again and his fear disappeared. They talked for the next three hours.
At ten o'clock, Bond was on the beach and dressed in his black frogman's suit. Quarrel and Strangways watched him go slowly into the sea and vanish under the water.
'Go safely,' said Quarrel quietly.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
686,"The heavy limpet mine was tied to Bond's chest and carried him straight to the bottom of the sea. He was carrying the harpoon gun in his left hand, but he travelled fast through the water. He was warm in the frogman's suit and breathed easily with the help of the compressed air. It took him fifteen minutes to swim through fifty yards of the dangerously sharp coral reef, which was full of all sorts of sea life. He stopped and rested for a short time at the edge of the reef. Then he swam forwards. There were shadows of big fish on the moonlit sand, some as long as himself. One shadow followed beside him, and he looked up to see a shark. Its nose was following Bond's line of air bubbles. After about a minute, it moved away.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
687,"Then there were large barracudas moving above him and looking down out of their angry eyes. They were interested in him and his bubbles and followed him silently. There were about twenty of them by the time Bond was near the island.
Suddenly, Bond could see the bottom of the boat above him. He looked at his watch. It was three minutes past eleven o'clock. He took a seven-hour fuse from his side pocket and pushed it into the limpet mine. The rest of the fuses he buried in the sand. He did not want them to be found if he was caught. After this, he swam up, carrying the mine between his hands. He fixed it as carefully as he could to the bottom of the boat and turned to swim towards some rocks. Then he saw what was happening behind him.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
688,"The barracudas seemed to be going crazy. They were swimming round in circles like mad dogs, and three sharks were moving quickly between them in the water.
Bond was hit in the face and knocked again and again. At any moment, his rubber suit would be torn and his skin broken and bleeding. Then the barracudas would smell the blood and be attacking him in seconds.He swam fast along the bottom of the boat with his harpoon gun ready. Suddenly, the sea above him turned red. Pieces of something floated down towards him. He caught a piece and looked at it. Up above, someone was throwing dead fish and pouring blood into the water. Mr Big was feeding them. They were his protection against people who wanted to have a look around, three of whom had already been half-eaten by the fish.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
689,"Something hit Bond hard on his left shoulder, and a large barracuda swam away with a piece of black rubber in its mouth. Bond felt no pain as he swam wildly towards the rocks. But blood was coming from his shoulder, and water was starting to come in between the rubber frogman's suit and his skin. He was just about to swim up to the water's surface when he saw a wide hole in the rocks in front of him. A large rock lay on its side next to it, and Bond swam behind the rock. He turned in time to see the barracuda coming towards him again. He fired the harpoon gun and hit the fish in the centre of its open mouth. The fish stopped and tried to close its mouth, then it swam away taking the gun, the line and harpoon with it.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
690,"Now Bond saw the cave that the large rock had been hiding. He swam through the opening for several yards, then stood up on soft sand. He shone his torch on the sides and ceiling of the cave. He guessed that it had been dug outwards from somewhere in the centre of the island. Probably by Bloody Morgan's men. The big rock had been there to cover the entrance. The Shark Bay fisherman who had disappeared six months ago must have found it. Perhaps a bad storm had moved it. Then the fisherman had found the treasure and had gone to Mr Big for help selling it. That had been a big mistake. Bond guessed that the fisherman had been killed and thrown into the Harlem River.
Bond guessed that his air bubbles had been seen, but he had to go on. He had to stop Solitaire getting on the boat.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4
691,"Bond tried to think. Suddenly, he saw a thin stream of his blood moving into the pool from his shoulder. He had forgotten the injury from the barracuda, but now it began to hurt. Suddenly, there was a big splash from the pool and two men were swimming towards him with knives in their hands. Before Bond could reach his own knife, they had pulled him up to the surface of the pool and out onto flat sand. His rubber suit was pulled off him, leaving him in swimming shorts. Bond looked up and saw Mr Big sitting behind a small table. He had a pen in one hand, and there were papers on the table. He looked calm and bored.
'Good morning, Mr Bond,' he said. 'You took a long time coming. We saw your air bubbles some time ago.'",james bond part 4,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
692,"Mr Big unlocked the door and opened it, and Bond and his guard followed him through into a long narrow room. There were metal shackles low down in the walls.
A light hung down from the roof at the far end. There was someone lying under it, under a blanket.
'Solitaire, said Mr Big softly.
Bond started to move forward, but the guard moved quickly and stopped him. Then Mr Big turned round. He had a small gun in his hand. He pointed it at Bond.
'You can let him go,' Mr Big told Bond's guard. Bond went past Mr Big. Solitaire was on her feet and moving towards him. She saw his face and began to run.
'James!' she cried. 'James!' They held each other.
'Get me some rope,' said Mr Big.
'It's all right, Solitaire,' said Bond, but he knew that everything was not all right. 'I'm here now.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
693,"Solitaire was very pale and there were black circles under her eyes. She wore a dirty white suit and looked thin. She saw the blood on his shoulder and down his arm.
'Oh, my darling, what is it?' she said, and started to cry.
'Tie them up,' said Mr Big. The black guard came towards them with rope in his hands.
For a second or two, Bond thought about attacking him.
'No, Mr Bond,' Mr Big said simply.
The guard tied Bond's arms behind his back.
Over there,' said Mr Big. He pointed at one of the shackles.
The guard knocked Bond's legs from under him, and Bond fell onto his injured shoulder. The guard pulled him across to the shackle, then put the rope through the shackle and down to Bond's legs. He tied them together. Then he walked back to Solitaire and tied her to a shackle opposite Bond.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
694,"Mr Big looked at his watch. 'Go,' he told the guard. He closed the big door behind the man, then turned to Bond.
'Four of my men have died because of you. My people are beginning to question my power, so something must be done. What happened to the American was not enough, so you and the girl can die together.' He looked at his watch again. 'In two-and-a-half hours, at six o'clock, you will be tied together. Then you'll be pulled through the sea behind the yacht when it leaves. The coral reef will cut you into pieces, and the sharks will smell the blood. They'll finish the job for me.' Bond looked at him.
'You're a big man,' he said.. 'And one day you'll die a big and terrible death. If you kill us, that death will come very fast.'",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
695,"Bond and Solitaire stood by some trees, and Bond breathed in the cool morning air. As they stood waiting, they saw men walking past carrying things. Everyone was leaving the island. Bond moved nearer to Solitaire. After Mr Big had left them, he had told her about the limpet mine. It would explode a few minutes after six o'clock, so it was important that the boat sailed at six. If they were still on the jetty beside the boat, they would be killed with Mr Big. Bond guessed that they would be pulled along at least seventy yards behind the yacht. The boat would go through the reef before them. With luck, the mine would explode before he and Solitaire reached the reef and were cut to pieces. But would they be killed by the explosion?",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4
696,"""'Look out!' said Bond as he saw the rope disappearing fast into the water. Bond and Solitaire were suddenly pulled off the jetty and into the sea. For a second, they both went under the water and then they were up again. The water was rushing past them and they were pulled through the waves.
'Breathe, breathe!' shouted Bond. 'Put your legs between mine!' After a time, the boat's speed dropped as the boat moved slowly through the reef. Suddenly, Bond felt the rope tighten again.
It must be after six o'clock now. What had happened to the mine? They were only about thirty yards from the reef now. Now twenty ... ten ...
Suddenly, the breath was knocked from his body. Solitaire and Bond went right up out of the sea before falling back again. The sky lit up with the huge explosion.""",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
697,"Bond felt the heavy rope pulling them under the water. He pushed hard with his legs and they came to the surface. Solitaire's head was on his shoulder and her eyes were shut.
The reef had protected them from the explosion, but now the sea was pulling them towards it. Suddenly, Bond felt the sharp coral against the back of his legs and arms.
There was something sharp under his feet, and he pushed against it. His feet were on the coral and then he felt the pain of a rock pushing into his back.
He rested for a minute. Solitaire was breathing thinly. There was blood in the water around him, but he guessed that the big fish would not come into the sharp reef.
He looked out to sea. The boat was gone, and a great cloud of smoke was blowing towards the land.",james bond part 4,3,Intermediate,2
698,"Bond turned and saw canoes coming towards him - and Quarrel was in the front canoe, yards ahead of the rest. For the first time since his childhood, Bond felt tears come into his blue-grey eyes. They were tears of happiness and relief. Life was suddenly very good.
Qiarrel brought them to the little beach at Beau Desert, and Bond half-carried Solitaire to the house. After they had baths and cleaned themselves, Quarrel took Bond to the hospital at Port Maria. The doctors worked on his shoulder, then Quarrel brought him back to the house. Bond was tired and covered in bandages. Another doctor had visited Solitaire, who had been cut by the coral, but was not badly hurt. Some new clothes would be brought for her from Kingston the next day.",james bond part 4,3,Advanced,4
699,"'You look wonderful,' Bond told Solitaire. They sat for a while, looking out between the trees as the sunlight started to disappear.
There was a crash of broken dishes from the kitchen at the back of the house. Then there was the sound of Quarrel shouting at someone.
'Poor Quarrel,' said Solitaire. 'He's borrowed the best cook in the village and is making us a special dinner. But it's supposed to be a surprise for us.' After they had eaten dinner, Bond told Solitaire about M's message.
'Two weeks' holiday will be wonderful. But I'm badly hurt. I'll also need someone special who can look after me and help me to get better.'
Do you know of anyone?' he asked, and grinned at her.
'Well, I haven't got any other plans for the next two weeks,' she said.",james bond part 4,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

The weather was bad, the people were dull, and the amusements of London seemed as exciting as a glass of cold water. 'Richard Hannay,' I told myself, 'you have made a mistake, and you had better do something about it.'
It made me angry when I thought of the years I had spent in Africa. I had spent those years working very hard and making money. Not a lot of money, but enough for me. I had left Scotland when I was six years old, and I had never been home since. For years I had dreamt of coming home to Britain and spending the rest of my life there, but I was disappointed with the place after the first week.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3

They were full of the troubles in south-east Europe, and there was a long report about Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister. He seemed to be an honest man, but some people in Europe hated him. However, many people in Britain liked him, and one newspaper said that he was the only man who could prevent a war starting. I remember wondering if I could get a job in south-east Europe; it might be a lot less boring than life in London.
As I walked home that night, I decided to give Britain one more day. I wanted to take part in some adventures. And if nothing interesting happened, I would take the next boat back to Africa.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

His voice was shaking a little.
I opened the door and we went in.
'Is the door locked?' he asked, and quickly locked it himself.
'I'm very sorry,' he said to me. 'It's very rude of me. But I'm in a dangerous corner and you looked like the kind of man who would understand. If I explain, will you help me?'

I sat down in an armchair and lit my pipe.
'How does it feel?' I asked. I was now almost sure that the man was mad.
He smiled. 'I'm not mad - yet. Listen, I've been watching you, and I guess that you're not easily frightened. I'm going to tell you my story. I need help very badly, and I want to know if you're the right man to ask.'

725,"Constantine Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, is intelligent, he's honest, and he knows what's going on and so his enemies plan to kill him. I have discovered how. That was very dangerous for me, so I had to disappear. They can't kill Karolides in Greece because he has too many guards. But on the 15th of June he's coming to London for a big meeting, and his enemies plan to kill him here.'
'You can warn him,' I said. 'He'll stay at home. That's what his enemies want. If he doesn't come, they'll win, because he's the only man who understands the whole problem and who can stop the war happening.'
'Why don't you go to the British police?' I said.
'No good. They could bring in five hundred policemen, but they wouldn't stop the murder.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Intermediate,2
726,"I was beginning to like this strange little man. I gave him another whisky and asked him why he thought that he was now in danger himself.
He took a large mouthful of whisky. 'I came to London by a strange route - through Paris, Hamburg, Norway, and Scotland. I changed my name in every country, and when I got to London, I thought I was safe. But yesterday I realized that they're still following me. There's a man watching this building and last night somebody put a card under my door. On it was the name of the man I fear most in the world.
'So I decided I had to die. Then they would stop looking for me. I faked everything. I've left a lot of empty whisky bottles in my room. The police will think I drank too much and then killed myself,' he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
727,"It was the strangest of stories. However, in my experience, the most extraordinary stories are often the true ones. And if the man just wanted to get into my flat and murder me, why didn't he tell a simpler story?
'Right,' I said. 'I'll trust you for tonight. I'll lock you in this room and keep the key. Just one word, Mr Scudder. I believe you're honest, but if you're not, I should warn you that I know how to use a gun.'
'Certainly,' he answered, jumping up. 'I'm afraid I don't know your name, sir, but I would like to thank you. And could I use your bathroom?'
When I next saw him, half an hour later, I didn't recognize him at first. His beard was gone, and his hair was completely different. He walked like a soldier, and he was wearing glasses. And he no longer spoke like an American.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
728,"The next morning when my servant Paddock arrived, I introduced him to Captain Digby. I explained that the Captain was an important man in the army, but he had been working too hard and needed rest and quiet. Then I went out, leaving them both in the flat. When I returned at about lunchtime, the doorman told me that the gentleman in flat 15 had killed himself. I went up to the top floor, had a few words with the police, and was able to report to Scudder that his plan had been successful. Scudder was very pleased. For the first two days in my flat, he was very calm and spent all his time reading and writing in a little black notebook. But after that, he became more nervous. It was not his own danger that he worried about, but the success of his plan to prevent the murder of the Greek Prime Minister.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4
729,"One night Scudder was very serious.
'Listen, Hannay,' he said. 'I think I must tell you some more about this business. I would hate to get killed without leaving someone else to carry on with my plan.'
I didn't listen very carefully. I was interested in Scudder's adventures, but I wasn't very interested in politics. I remember that he said Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, was only in danger in London. He also mentioned a woman called Julia. He talked about a Black Stone and a man who lisped when he spoke. And he described another dangerous man.
The next evening I had to go out. I was meeting a man I had known in Africa for dinner. When I returned to the flat, I was surprised to see that the light in the study was out. I saw something in the corner that made my blood turn cold. There was a long knife through Scudder' heart.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
730,"I sat down in an armchair and felt very sick. After about five minutes I started shaking. Then I took the whisky bottle and drank several mouthfuls. After a few more minutes I managed to calm myself down a little. I looked at my watch and saw that it was half-past ten.
By this time I was beginning to think more clearly. The Scudder's murder looked bad for me - that was clear. It was now certain that Scudder's story was true - the proof was lying under the table-cloth. His enemies had found him and made sure of his silence. But he had been in my flat for four days, and they must think he had told his story to me. So I would be the next to die. It might be that night, or the next day, or the day after, but it was sure to happen.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
731,"I had a problem now. I could call the police, or go to bed and wait for Paddok, my servant, to discover the body and call them in the morning. But what would the police think? What story would I tell them about the stranger in my flat? I had lied to Paddock about him, and my story would be hard to believe. They would arrest me for murder, and I had no real friends in England to help me. Perhaps that was part of the plan. An English prison would be a safe place for me until the 15th of June.
Even if the police did believe my story, I would still be helping Scudder's enemies. Karolides, the Greek Prime Minister, would stay at home, which was what they wanted. But now I felt responsible for continuing his work. I hate to see a good man beaten, and if I carried on in my friend's place, the murderers might not win.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
732,"I decided I must disappear, and remain hidden until just before the 15th of June. Then I must contact some government people and tell them my friend's story. I wished he had told me more, and that I had listened more carefully to what he had told me. There was a risk that the government would not believe me, but it was my best chance. Perhaps more evidence would appear which would help me to make my story believable.
It was now the 24th of May, so I had twenty days of hiding. Two groups of people would be looking for me - Scudder's enemies, who would want to kill me, and the police, who would want me for Scudder's murder. There was going to be a chase, and, surprisingly, I was almost happy about this. I did not want to sit in one place and wait. If I could move, the situation did not seem so bad.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4
733,"I wondered if my friend had any papers which would give me more information about his business. I lifted off the table-cloth and searched him. There were only a few coins in his trouser pockets. There was no sign of the little black notebook. I supposed his murderer had taken that.
When I turned from the body, I noticed that all the cupboards were open. Scudder had been a very careful man, and always kept the place tidy. Someone had been searching for something, and perhaps for the notebook. I went round the flat and found that everything had been searched - the insides of books, cupboards, boxes, even the pockets of my clothes. There was no sign of the notebook, so Scudder's enemies had probably found it in the end.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
734,"I got out a map of Britain. My plan was to find a wild country. I was used to Africa, and I would feel trapped in the city. I thought Scotland would probably be best because my family came from Scotland and I could pretend to be a Scotsman easily. The other possibility was to be a German tourist. But it would probably be better to be a Scotsman in Scotland. I decided to go to Galloway, which seemed to be the nearest wild part of Scotland. In the railway timetable, I found a train from London, which would get me to Galloway in the late afternoon. The problem was getting to the station, as I was certain that Scudder's enemies were watching the building. I thought about this problem, had a good idea, went to bed, and slept for two hours.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
735,"I got up at four o'clock. The first light of a summer morning was in the sky and the birds were starting to sing. I put on some old clothes which I used for country walking and some strong walking boots. I pushed another shirt and a toothbrush into my pockets. I had taken a lot of money out of the bank in case my friend needed it, so I took that as well. Then I cut my long moustache as short as possible.
My servant arrived every morning at seven-thirty. But at about twenty to seven I knew the milkman would come; the noise of the milk bottles usually woke me up. He was a young man with a very short moustache, and he wore a white coat. He was my only chance.
I had a breakfast of biscuits and whisky and by the time I had finished it was about six o'clock.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
736,"I bought some sandwiches at lunch time. I also bought the morning newspaper and read a little about south-east Europe. When I had finished, I got out my friend's black book and studied it. It was almost full of writing, mostly numbers, although sometimes there was a name. For example, I found the words 'Hofgaard', 'Luneville', and 'Avocado' quite often. The word I saw the most was 'Pavia'.
I was certain that Scudder was using a code. I have always been interested in codes; I enjoy games and numbers and things like that. It seemed to be a number code, where groups of numbers replace letters. I worked on the words, because you can use a word as a key in a number code. I tried for hours, but none of the words helped. Then I fell asleep, and woke up at Dumfries.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
737,"There was a man on the platform who worried me a little; he was watching the crowd more closely than I liked. But he didn't look at me, and when I saw myself in a mirror, I understood why; with my brown face and my oId clothes I looked just like all the other hill farmers who were getting into the local train.
I travelled with a group of these farmers. The train travelled slowly through narrow valleys and then up onto an open moor. There were lakes, and in the distance I could see high mountains.
At five o'clock the carriage was empty and I was alone. I got out at the next station, a tiny place in the middle of the moor. A ten-year-old child took my ticket, and I came out of the station onto a white road across the moor.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
738,"It was a beautiful, clear spring evening. I felt like a boy on a walking holiday, instead of a man of thirty-seven very much wanted by the police. I walked along that road whistling, feeling happier every minute.
After some time I left the road and followed a path along a little stream. I was getting tired when I came to a small house. The woman who lived there was friendly and said I could sleep there. She also gave me an excellent meal.
Her husband came home from the hills later in the evening. We talked about cows and sheep and markets, and I tried to remember some of the information I heard because it might be useful. By ten o'clock I was asleep, and I slept until five o'clock in the morning.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
739,"When I had finished reading the newspaper, I looked out of the window and noticed that we were stopping at the station where I had got out yesterday. Three men were talking to the man who I had seen digging potatoes. I sat well back from the window and watched carefully. One of the men was taking notes, and I supposed they were from the local police. Then, I saw the child who had taken my ticket talking, and the men looked out across the moor along the road I had taken.
As we left the station, the farmer woke up, looked at me, and asked where he was. He had clearly drunk too much.
'I never drink,' he said, sadly. 'I haven't touched whisky since last year. And now I've got this terrible headache.'
His voice got slower and slower and soon he fell asleep again.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
740,"I had planned to leave the train at a station, but it now stopped by a river and I decided this would be better. I looked out of the carriage window and saw nobody, so I opened the door and dropped quickly down into the long grass. My plan was going perfectly until the dog decided that I was stealing something and began to bark loudly. This woke up the farmer who started to shout. He thought I was trying to kill myself. I crawled through the long grass for about a hundred metres and then looked back. The train driver and several passengers were all staring in my direction.
Luckily, the dog was now so excited that he pulled the farmer out of the carriage. The other passengers ran to help him. Soon they had forgotten me, and the next time I looked back, the train was moving again.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
741,"I was now in the middle of the empty moor, and for the first time I felt really frightened, not of the police but of the people who knew that I knew my friend's secret. If they caught me, I would be a dead man.
I reached the top of a low hill and looked around. To the south, a long way away, I saw something which made me tremble...
Low in the sky a small plane was flying slowly across the moor. I was certain that it was looking for me, and I was also certain that it was not the police. I hid low in the heather and watched it for an hour or two. Finally, it disappeared to the south.
I did not like this spying from the air, and I began to think that an open moor was perhaps not the best place to hide. I could see distant forests in the east, and decided that would be better country.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
742,"It was about six o'clock in the evening when I left the moor and entered the trees. I came to a bridge by a house, and there, on the bridge, was a young man.
He was sitting smoking a pipe, dreamily watching the water, and holding a book. He jumped up as he heard my feet on the road and I saw a friendly young face.
'Good evening to you,' he said in a serious voice. 'It's a fine night to be on the road.'
The smell of cooking came from the house.
'Is that house a hotel?' I asked.
'It certainly is.'
I sat down next to him and got out my pipe. I began to think this young man might help me.
'You're young to own a hotel,' I said.
'My father died a year ago and now it's mine. It's not an exciting job for a young man like me. I didn't choose to do it. I want to write books.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
743,"You've got the right job,' I said. 'With all the travellers you meet you could be the best storyteller in the world.'
'Not today,' he said. 'Two hundred years ago, there were exciting people on the road, but today there are only cars full of fat old women, and fishermen. You can't make stories out of them. I want to sail up an African river, or live in an Indian village and write about things like that.' The hotel looked peaceful in the evening sun.
'I've travelled a bit,' I said, 'and I'd be happy to live in a peaceful place like this. And perhaps you're sitting next to adventure now. I'll tell you a true story, and you can make a book and sell it all around the world if you like.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
744,"I told him I was in the gold business in Africa, and I had discovered a group of international thieves. They had chased me to England and had killed my best friend. I described a chase across the desert, and an attack on the ship from Africa.
And I described the Langham Place murder in detail. 'You want adventure,' I said, 'well, here it is. The thieves are chasing me now, and the police are chasing them.'
'It's wonderful!' he whispered.
'You believe me,' I said gratefully.
'Of course I do,' he said. 'I can believe anything strange. It's things that happen every day that are difficult to believe.'
He was very young, but he was the man I needed.
'I must hide and rest for a day or two. Will you help me?'
He jumped up and led me to the house. 'You'll be safe here. I can keep a secret.""",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4
745,"As I entered the hotel, I heard the sound of an engine. In the sky to the west was my enemy the plane. He gave me a room at the back of the house. I asked him to watch out for cars and planes and sat down to work on my friend's little book. As I have said, it was a number code. I had to find the word that was the key to it, and when I thought of the million words it might be, I felt hopeless. But the next afternoon I remembered that Scudder had said a woman called Julia Czechenyi was the key to the Greek Prime Minister business, so I tried her name as the code key. It was the answer. In half an hour I was reading, with a white face. Suddenly, I heard the sound of a car stopping outside the hotel and voices. Some people was talking to the hotel's owner.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
746,"My young friend came up to my room, his eyes bright with excitement.
'There are two men looking for you,' he whispered. 'They're downstairs now having a drink. They described you very well.
I told them you had stayed here last night and had left this morning.'
I asked him to describe them. One was a thin man with dark eyes, the other was always smiling and lisped. They were both English; my young friend was certain of this.
I took a piece of paper and wrote these words in German. I made it look like one page of a private letter: ""My friend had discovered this, but he could do nothing for a fortnight. I don't think it's any good now because Karolides is uncertain about his plans"".
'Give this to them and say you found it in my bedroom. Ask them to return it to me if they find me.'",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
747,"Now I'll tell you what I want you to do,' I said. 'Go to the police station and describe the two men to them. Say you think they may have something to do with the London murder. I'm sure those two men will be back here tomorrow morning for more information about me. Tell the police to be here early.'
At about eight o'clock the next morning I watched three policemen arrive. They hid their car and came into the hotel. Twenty minutes later another car came towards the hotel, but stopped in some trees about two hundred metres away. The two men inside walked up to the hotel.
I had planned to hide in my bedroom and see what happened. But now I had a better idea. I wrote a note to thank the young man for his help, opened my window and dropped out.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
748,"I drove that car across the moor as fast as I could, looking nervously over my shoulder. I was also thinking desperately about Scudder's notes. Scudder had told me nothing but lies.
All his stories about south-east Europe and people wanting to start wars were rubbish. But although he had told me lies, there was truth underneath.
The 15th of June was going to be an important day, but because of something more important than the murder of a Prime Minister. The story in his book was not complete, and there were some things I didn't understand - for example, the words 'thirty-nine steps', which appeared five or six times.
The most important thing I learned was that war was certain. Everything was planned. Karolides was going to be murdered and nothing could prevent it.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4
749,"Britain was not prepared for war. The Greek Prime Minister would be murdered and war would seem certain. Germany would pretend to be against war. There was something else. Although the newspapers didn't know it, the British and French governments were close allies, and had agreed to prepare for war together.
The most important officers in the armies and navies met regularly, and in June one of the top people was coming from Paris for a meeting.
But on the 15th of June other people were going to be in London. Scudder didn't give names, but called them just the 'Black Stone'. They planned to get hold of this information, which was meant only for the French Government. And the information would be used by our enemies just a week or two later, with a most terrible effect.",the thirty-nine steps part 1,3,Advanced,4

'It's in my pocket,' I said. 'I'm from Australia, so I never carry much luggage.'

It seemed strange to ask a man you had met in a car crash speak at an election meeting, 'All right,' I said. 'I'm not a good speaker, but I'll speak for a bit.'

But behind all the rubbish I could see that Sir Harry was a nice man. And he spoke very badly. I knew I wasn't a good speaker, but I would be better than him.
I simply told them everything I knew about Australia. I said that Britain and Australia must work together and be friends. I think I was rather a success.

Everything you said tonight was dangerous rubbish.'
'Was it? I wasn't sure myself. Do you think Germany is going to start a war with us?'
'In six weeks' time you won't need to ask me that.
Listen, and I'll tell you a story.

It was now about seven o'clock in the morning, and as I waited, I heard the sound of an engine in the air. I realized that I was in a bad position, because I had nowhere to hide. I sat, hopelessly, as the aeroplane came nearer. It was high at first, but then it came down very low. I could see one of the two men looking at me very carefully.

They had probably seen my bicycle, so they would expect me to try and escape by road. I found a small lake about a hundred metres from the road and threw the bicycle in. Then I climbed to a higher bit of ground and looked around.
Here was nowhere to hide. The moor was open, but to me, it was like a prison. I started to walk to the north, and as I walked, I saw a car about fifteen kilometres away on the road. And, in the valley below me, I could see a line of men walking slowly upwards. The north was no good. I turned and began to run southwards. I ran hard, watching the skyline in front of me, and soon I thought I could see distant figures on the hill. I ran down to the road.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
777,"Suddenly, I found the roadman. He had just started work mending the road, when he saw me.
'I'm sorry I ever stopped farming!' he said. 'I was my own boss then. Now I have to do what the government orders, and I'm a prisoner here with aching eyes and a bad back. And my head's going to explode!'
He was about the same age as me and wore big black glasses. He started to work again and then stopped.
'I can't do it,' he cried. 'I'm going back to bed.'
I asked him what the problem was, although I could guess. 'It was my daughter's wedding last night, so we were dancing and drinking until four o'clock in the morning. And the new Road Inspector is coming to visit today! He'll come and not find me, or he'll come and find me like this. Whatever happens, I'm finished...'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
778,"A big car stopped and two men got out and walked towards me. I had seen them before - from the window of the hotel. The fatter of the two looked at me with sharp bright eyes.
'Good morning,' he said. 'That's an easy job you've got there.' 'There are worse jobs and there are better jobs,' I said. I spoke in Alexander Turnbull's strong Scottish accent. The other man was looking at my boots.
'You've very fine boots.Were they made near here?'
'Oh no, they were made in London. I was given them by a man who was here on holiday last year.'
The fatter man spoke to the other in German. 'Let's move on. This man can't help us.'
They did ask one more question.
'Did you see anyone pass early this morning? Either on a bicycle or on foot?'
'I wasn't up very early. And I've seen no bicycles this morning.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
779,"Just before five o'clock an open touring car came up the road,a cigarette, and, by an extraordinary chance, I knew him. His name was Marmaduke Jopley and he was a man I disliked very much. He was only interested in people with money, and in visiting people who lived in beautiful houses in the country. I ran up to the car and took his arm.'Hallo, Jopley.'
His mouth opened wide as he looked at me. 'Who are you?' 'My name's Hannay,' I said. 'You remember me.'
'The murderer!' he cried.
'No, but it doesn't matter. Give me your coat and hat.' He did what I asked. He was very frightened. I put his coat and hat on, and put Mr Turnbull's hat on Jopley's head. I got in the car and started it.
'Now, my friend,' I said, 'you sit quietly and be a good boy. I'm going to borrow your car for an hour or two.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
780,"I spent the night in the hills, in some thick heather behind a rock. I had no coat and I was very cold. My coat, Scudder's notebook, my watch and even my pipe and tobacco were with Mr Turnbull. All I had was some biscuits.
I had half the biscuits for supper and tried to keep warm in the heather. I was feeling quite pleased. So far I had been very lucky. The milkman, the man at the hotel, Sir Harry, the roadman and even Marmaduke had all helped me, and I felt that with help like this I might win. My main problem now was that I was very hungry. I couldn't go to a shop to buy some food or find it anywhere. That's I fell asleep imagining the most beautiful and delicious meals I'd ever seen in my life.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
781,"I woke up very cold in the early morning. I looked down the hill, and in a second I was putting my boots on as fast as I could. There were men only a few hundred metres below me, walking up and searching the heather step by step.
Keeping low in the heather, I moved up the hill. At the top, I stood up and showed myself. I heard men shouting, and then I pretended to disappear over the top of the hill, but in fact, I got down in the heather and crawled back down into the valley. After twenty minutes I looked back and saw the men disappearing over the top of the hill. I didn't know where I was, but I knew I must keep moving. I was twenty minutes in front of them, but they were local men and they knew these hills better than I did. Soon they were close behind me and I was running as fast as I could.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
782,"People were chasing me and I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, I saw a house and as I came nearer the house, I saw an old man looking at me through an open door. I crossed the garden and went in.
I was in a pleasant room, with books everywhere. At a desk in the middle sat an old man with a kind face. He didn't move, but looked up and waited for me to speak.
I was so surprised by his calmness that for a minute I just stared at him.
'You're in a hurry, my friend,' he said slowly. 'The police are after you, are they? Well, we'll talk about it later. I don't like the police in my house when I'm working. Go through that door on the left and close it behind you. You will be safe in there.'
And this extraordinary man picked up his pen and started to write, and I did what he said.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
783,"I found myself in a small room with only a very small window high up in one wall. The door closed behind me. Once again I had found somewhere to hide.
But I didn't feel comfortable. There was something strange about the old man. I had suddenly appeared in his house, but he didn't seem surprised. And his eyes were frighteningly intelligent. I waited, and tried to forget that I was very hungry. I thought about breakfast, and suddenly the door opened and there was the old man again.
'I told the police you had gone over the hill. This is a lucky morning for you, Mr Richard Hannay,' he said, smiling.
As he spoke, his eyes half closed, and immediately I remembered Scudder's description of a man who could 'hood his eyes like a hawk'. I saw that I had walked into the hands of my enemies.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
784,"The old man knew my name, but he had never seen me before. I took a chance. 'I don't know what you mean,' I said roughly. 'And who are you calling Hannay? My name's Ainslie.' 'Of course, you have many names,' he said, still smiling.
'We won't argue about a name.'
I looked at him angrily. 'I suppose you're going to call the police back. I wish I'd never seen that car. Here's the money.' I put four pounds on the table.
'I won't call the police,' he said. 'This is a private problem between you and me.'
'Oh, stop it!' I cried. 'I've had no luck since I left my ship in Edinburgh. I found a crashed car and took a little money out of it, and I've had the police after me for two days. You do what you like. Ned Ainslie's finished.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
785,"Would you be kind enough to tell me what you've been doing for the last few days?'
'I can't. I haven't eaten for two days. Give me something to eat and I'll tell you the truth.' Some food was brought to me, and while I was eating, he said something to me in German. I stared at him stupidly. Then I told him my story. I was a sailor, and I had left my ship in Edinburgh to travel across Scotland to see my brother. I had found a car in a river and taken some money from it. But the police were now chasing me.
'They can have their money back,' I cried. 'It's only brought me trouble!'
'You're good at lying, Hannay,' he said.
I started to get very angry. 'My name's Ainslie and I don't know anybody called Hannay. No, I'm sorry, sir, I'm grateful for the food, but I'd like to go now.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
786,"The back room was very dark and full of old bottles and boxes. The windows had shutters on the outside. The key turned in the door, and I could hear the feet of the guards outside.
I sat down feeling very unhappy. The old man had gone to collect his friends, the men who had talked to me when I was the roadman. They would soon discover that I was not the roadman, nor Mr Ainslie, but Richard Hannay. I began to wish I had been found by the police; I would feel safer with them than with this man and his two friends. They were coming for lunch, so I had only two hours. I tried the windows but they would not move. I felt the boxes and bottles, and then found a door in the wall. It was a cupboard door, and it was locked, but I pulled on it until it opened.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
787,"When I woke up, my head was burning and the sun was shining into my face. I lay for a long time without moving. I could hear men talking about something. I looked through a hole in the wall and saw men with guns. There was the bald man and I thought I could see the fat one too.
For half an hour they searched all the buildings. They came to the door at the bottom of my tower, and for a minute I thought they were going to come up, but the door was locked. All afternoon I lay on that roof. I was terribly thirsty, and, to make it worse, I could see and hear a small stream which came off the moor and flowed near the farm. I wanted a drink of that cool clear water more than anything in the world.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
788,"I sat on a hill-top and thought about my next move. I wasn't very happy, because although I had escaped, I was feeling very ill. The smoke had been very unpleasant. I had a terrible headache, and my arm hurt so badly that I could not move it.
I decided to go back to Mr Turnbull's house and find my clothes and my friend's notebook. Then I would take a train to the south. The sooner I met Sir Harry's friend in the government, Sir Walter Bullivant, the better. I hoped he would believe my story, but, even if he did not, I would be safer with him, or even the British police, than with those men at the farmhouse.
It was a clear, starry night and easy to find my way across the hills. I thought I was probably about thirty kilometres from Mr Turnbull's house, so I could not get there in one night.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
789,"It started to rain, and I spent the afternoon under a rock. That night was the most miserable of all. There were no stars, and I got lost at least twice. I had about fifteen kilometres more to go, but I think I walked thirty. In the end, in the very early morning, in a thick fog, I knocked on Mr Turnbull's door.
Mr Turnbull opened the door wearing an old black suit and a tie. At first he did not recognize me.
'What are you doing here at this time on a Sunday morning?' My head was so bad that I could not answer for a moment, but then he recognized me, and saw that I was ill.
I realized that my malaria had come back. I had had malaria in Africa, and it returned sometimes. The smoke, my arm, the wet and the cold had probably not helped. Soon, Mr Turnbull was helping me into a bed.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
790,"Mr Turnbull was a good friend. He took care of me for ten days, until my fever had gone and my arm was much better. He went out to work every day, locking the door, and in the evening he sat by the fire. He asked no questions, but on some days he brought me a newspaper, and I saw that the excitement over the Langham Place murder was over.
One day he gave me my money back. 'There's a lot of money there. You'd better count it and see if it's all there.'
I wanted to move as soon as possible, but it was not until the 12th of June that I felt well enough to go. I made Turnbull accept some money for my food, but it was difficult.
I walked the twenty kilometres to the station in a day. I was very happy to be in the train, and on the way south.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
791,"I slept on the train until early morning. Then I changed trains two or three times. At about eight o'clock in the evening I arrived at the small station at Artinswell, to the west of London. The road led through a wood into a green valley. Soon I came to a bridge and looked down into the river, whistling the song 'Annie Laurie'.
A fisherman walked up from the river, and as he got near to me, he started to whistle the same song. He was a big man in old clothes and a wide hat. He smiled at me, and I looked at his kind, intelligent face.
'The water's clear, isn't it?' he said. 'Look at that big fish lying on the bottom. I've been trying to catch him all evening.'
He whistled again, then paused. 'Your name's Twisdon, isn't it?' 'No,' I said. 'I mean yes.' I had forgotten the name I had given Sir Walter.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
792,"I told Sir Walter the whole story, from the night I came home and found my friend murdered. I told him what Scudder had told me about the Greek Prime Minister, and saw him smile once or twice. Then I told him about the murder, and the milkman, and Scotland, and Scudder's notebook.
'You've got it here?' he asked, and looked pleased when I took it from my pocket.
Then I told him about my meeting with Sir Harry, and he laughed. My day as a roadman interested him. He made me describe the two men in the car, and seemed to be thinking hard.
When I described the old man in the farmhouse, he stopped smiling.
'Old, bald, and hoods his eyes like a hawk. I don't like the sound of him. And you blew up his house. You're a brave man.'
Then I reached the end of my story.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2
793,"Sir Walter stood up, by the fire, and looked down at me.
'You don't need to worry about the police,' he said.
'They don't want you anymore.'
'Have they arrested the murderer?'
'No. But they know it's not you.'
'How?'
'Because I heard from Scudder. I knew him a bit. He was a strange man, but he was honest. I had a letter from him on the 31st of May.'
'But he'd been dead for a week by then.'
'The letter was written and posted on the 23rd. His letters usually went to Spain and then Newcastle, so they took a week to arrive.'
'What did he say?'
'That he was in danger. He said he was living in Langham Place, and that he was with a good friend. I think he wanted to help you in case he was murdered. When I got the letter, I went to Scotland Yard and talked to the police.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
794,"I came down to breakfast the next morning and found Sir Walter reading a coded message. He seemed less relaxed than yesterday.
'I was very busy for an hour after you went to bed,' he said. 'I've arranged for the Frenchman, Royer, to come a day early. He will be in London at five o'clock. I don't think the change of day will help very much. If our enemies already knew he was coming, they will probably find out that the plans have changed. I would love to know how the news of his visit escaped.'
While I ate, he continued to talk. I was surprised that he was telling me all these important secrets.
After breakfast, he asked me to be his driver for the day.
In London, we went first to Scotland Yard where we met an important-looking policeman.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
795,"I didn't know what to do. It was strange to be a free man. I went to a very good restaurant for lunch, but I was still feeling nervous. When anybody looked at me, I wondered if they were thinking about the murder. I walked around London, thinking. I knew that by now Royer would be in England, and I felt sure that something terrible was going to happen and that only I could stop it. But it was not my business now.
I didn't want to go back to my flat. I had to go back sometime, but I decided to stay at a hotel tonight.
I had supper in another restaurant, and thought that after that I would go to Sir Waiter's house. He might not want me there, but I would feel happier if I went. That's why I decided to go for a walk.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
796,"I picked up the telephone book and looked up the number of Lord Alloa's house. I spoke to one of his servants.
'Is Lord Alloa at home?' I asked.
'Yes, but he's ill and has been in bed all day. Do you want to leave a message, sir?'
I put down the telephone and sat down, shaking. My part in this business was not finished. I walked straight into the room where the others were meeting.
Sir Walter looked surprised and annoyed. 'I'm afraid that this is not a good time, Mr Hannay.'
I think it is,' I answered. 'Tell me, please, who left this room a minute ago.'
'Lord Alloa,' said Sir Waiter, looking angrier.
'It was not,' I cried. 'It looked like him but it was not him.'
'Who. . .' someone asked.
'The Black Stone,' I cried, sitting down, and looking at five frightened men.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
797,"Sir Walter got up and left the room. He came back after ten minutes. 'I've spoken to Alloa. I got him out of bed - he was very angry. He hasn't left his house all day.'
'It's impossible,' said Winstanley. 'I sat next to him for nearly half an hour.'
'That's what's so clever,' I said. 'You were too interested in other things to look at him closely. You knew that he might be well enough to come tonight and, as First Sea Lord, it was natural for him to be here. Why should you suspect that it wasn't him?'
Then the Frenchman spoke, very slowly, and in good English. 'This young man is right. He understands our enemies. People only see what they expect to see. This man came late, spoke little, and left early - but he behaved exactly as we would expect Lord Alloa to behave.'",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
798,"Our enemies don't want us to know what they have learnt about our war plans. But if one of us talked to Lord Alloa about tonight's meeting, we would discover immediately that he hadn't been here.'
Sir Walter laughed angrily. 'That shows their cleverness again, in choosing Alloa. They took a risk, but everybody knows that Alloa is a sick man and is often too ill to go to meetings. And even when he is well, he is impatient, difficult, and a man of very few words. Which of us was likely to speak to him about tonight?'
'But the spy hasn't taken the plans,' said Winstanley. 'He saw them, but could he carry away pages of information in his head?'
'It's not difficult,' said the Frenchman. 'A good spy can remember things photographically.'
'Well, I suppose we'll have to change our plans,' said Sir Walter.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
799,"Suddenly, I had an idea.
'Where is Scudder's book?' I asked Sir Waiter. 'Quick, I remember something in it.'
He gave it to me.
I found the place. 'Thirty-nine steps,' I read, and again, 'Thirty-nine steps -I counted them -high tide, 10.17 p.m.'
'Don't you see it's a clue?' I cried. 'Scudder knew where they were going to leave England. Tomorrow was the day, and it's somewhere where high tide is at 10.17.'
'Perhaps they've already gone tonight,' someone suggested. 'Not them. They have their own secret way, and why should they hurry? They don't know that we're after them.'
Whittaker looked happier. 'It's a chance,' he said. 'Let's go to the Navy Offices.'
Sir Walter went off to Scotland Yard to get MacGillivray. The rest of us drove to the Navy Offices where we went to a big room full of books and maps.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Intermediate,2
800,My first idea was to write a letter to the British Prime Minister. But nobody would believe my story. I had to find proof of the whole story. I drove to the east through a country at peace and I saw a policeman standing outside the Post Office.,the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
801,"I almost did stop. But then I realized that the policeman had been reading about me. I supposed the police at the hotel had worked quickly and contacted all the local villages. I drove faster, the policeman jumped out of my way.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
802,"A hand helped me out of the tree, and a frightened voice asked me if I was badly hurt. The speaker was a young man who was very alarmed and very sorry. I was more pleased than angry; it was a good way for the car to disappear.",the thirty-nine steps part 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

820,"Sherlock Holmes became a detective in 1877, four years before I met him. At first he enjoyed every case, but soon he began to find the work easy. Ten years later he was famous, but he was unhappy and bored.
'The modern criminal is so painfully slow and stupid,' he often said. 'I need an interesting case, Watson, one which will make me think. Are there no clever thieves or murderers in the world these days?'
It is dangerous for a very intelligent man like Holmes to become bored. Some days he grew violent and once he shot several bullets into the walls of his room.
One day in 1888 a note arrived from Scotland Yard. When Holmes opened it, he laughed and jumped to his feet.
'Inspector Lestrade wishes to see me,' he said. 'The police need my help, Watson.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2
821,"I was sitting alone at home one evening. My wife was away on a visit. Suddenly, the door opened, and Holmes came in. He then ran to the window, closed it and locked it.
'Holmes,' I cried. 'What has happened? You look terrible!'
He looked old and ill, and he was shaking with tiredness.
'What is it?' I asked. 'Are you afraid of something?'
'Of someone,' he said. 'Did you not get my letter?'
'Yes, but I didn't understand it. What is wrong?' Holmes looked at me sadly.
'You didn't understand it. Is your wife here?'
No, she is away. Do you want to sleep here? I shall make sure that you are in no danger.'
He shook his head.
'I cannot rest anywhere. If I sleep, the criminal will win! I cannot stay here. But you can help me, Watson. I must leave the country tomorrow. Will you come with me?'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
822,"Holmes ran out of the house. I followed him quickly and the next two hours passed in a wild chase all over London. We jumped into a cab, out of it again and onto a train, ran down narrow streets and in and out of a big hotel. Finally, we came to rest in the peace of a London park.
'You are a true friend, Watson,' Holmes said at last. 'You came with me without a question. Did you realize that someone was following us?'
'Holmes!'
For a moment I found it difficult to speak.
Then I asked, 'Did you see him through the window? Where was he?'
'In the empty house opposite ours. He was watching our rooms, Watson. He knows that I am looking for him. We must be very careful. He is one of the most dangerous criminals in Europe.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
823,"At the time of this story, I was still living at my friend Sherlock Holmes's flat in Baker Street in London. Very early one morning, a young woman, dressed in black, came to see us. She looked tired and unhappy, and her face was very white.
'I'm afraid! Afraid of death, Mr Holmes!' she cried. 'Please help me! I'm not thirty yet and look at my grey hair! I'm so afraid!'
'Just sit down and tell us your story,' said Holmes kindly.
'My name is Helen Stoner,' she began, 'and I live with my stepfather, Dr Grimesby Roylott, near a village in the country. His family was once very rich, but they had no money when my stepfather was born. So he studied to be a doctor, and went out to India.

'And now you live with him in the country,' said Holmes.
'Yes, but he stays at home and never sees anybody, Mr Holmes!' answered Helen Stoner. 'He's more and more violent now, and sometimes has fights with the people from the village.

825,"My sister Julia died two years ago, and that's why I'm here. We never met anybody in the country, but sometimes we visited some of my family who live near London. There Julia met a young man who asked to marry her. My stepfather agreed, but soon after this she died.' Miss Stoner put her hand over her eyes and cried for a minute.
Sherlock Holmes was listening with his eyes closed, but now he opened them and looked at Helen Stoner.
'Tell me everything about her death,' he said.
'I can remember it all very well. It was a terrible time!' she answered. 'I couldn't sleep that night. It was a very stormy night. Suddenly I heard a woman's scream. It was my sister's voice. I ran into the corridor, and just then to my sister's door. She opened it and fell to the ground.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
826,"Helen Stoner continued telling her story...
The police couldn't understand why my sister died. Her door was locked and nobody could get into her room. They didn't find any poison in her body. But I think she died because she was so afraid, but I don't know what she was afraid of. Perhaps it was the gipsies.
'That was two years ago,' Helen Stoner said. 'I have been very lonely without my sister, but a month ago a friend asked me to marry him. My stepfather has agreed, and so we're going to marry soon. But two days ago I had to move to my sister's old bedroom, because some men are mending my bedroom wall, and last night I heard that whistle! I ran out of the house immediately and came to London to ask for your help. Please help me, Mr Holmes! I don't want to die like Julia!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
827,"Holmes went out for the morning, but he came back at lunch-time. We then went by train into the country, and took a taxi to Dr Roylott's house. 'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'our dangerous friend Roylott needs the girls' money, because he only has £750 a year from his dead wife. I found that out this morning.
When we arrived, Helen Stoner showed us the three bedrooms. We saw her room first.
'Why are they mending your bedroom wall?' asked Holmes. 'There's nothing wrong with it.'
'You're right,' she said. 'I think it was a plan to move me into my sister's room.'
'Yes,' said Holmes. We went into Julia's room, and Holmes looked at the windows carefully.
'Nobody could come in from outside,' he said.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
828,"Holmes and Watson went into Dr Roylott's room. Holmes saw a large metal box near the wall.
'My stepfather keeps business papers in there,' said Helen.
'Does he keep a cat in there too?' asked Holmes. 'Look!' There was some milk on a plate on top of the box.
'Now, Miss Stoner,' he said, 'I think your life is in danger. Tonight my friend Watson and I must spend the night in your sister's room, where you are sleeping at the moment.'
Helen Stoner and I looked at him in surprise.
'Yes, we must,' he went on. 'We'll take a room in a hotel in the village. When your stepfather goes to bed, put a light in your sister's bedroom window and leave it open. Then go into your old room and we'll get into your sister's room through the window."" Helen Stoner agreed.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
829,"Holmes saw a snake and started shouting.
'The speckled band!'
The band moved and began to turn its head.
'Be careful, Watson! It's an Indian snake and its poison can kill very quickly,' Holmes cried. 'Roylott died immediately. We must put the snake back in its box.'
Very, very carefully, Holmes took the snake and threw it into the metal box.
'But how did you know about the snake, Holmes?' I asked.
'At first, Watson, I thought that it was the gipsies. But then I understood. I thought that perhaps something came through the air-vent, down the bell-rope and onto the bed. Then there was the milk and of course, snakes drink milk. And because he was a doctor, he knew that this snake's poison is difficult to find in a dead body. Perhaps the snake came through the air-vent many times before it killed Julia.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
830,"For Sherlock Holmes, there was only one woman in the world. He did not love her, because he never loved women. But after their meeting he never forgot her. Her name was Irene Adler.
One night in March I visited my old friend at his home in Baker Street. I was married by now, so I did not often see him.
'Come in, Watson,' he said. 'Sit down. I'm happy to see you, because I've got something to show you. What do you think of this? It arrived in the last post.'
It was a letter, with no date, name or address.
It said: 'Tonight someone will visit you, to talk about some very secret business. You have helped other important people, and you can, we hope, help us. Be in your room at 7.45 p.m.'
'Shall I leave, Holmes?' I asked.
'No, no, I need your help. This will be interesting,' my friend answered.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0
831,"There was a knock at the door.
'Come in!' called Holmes.
A tall, strong man came into the room. He was wearing expensive clothes, and a mask over his face. 'You can call me Count von Kramm. I come from Bohemia,' he said. 'My business is most important. Before I tell you about it, do you agree to keep it a secret?'
'I do,' we said together.
'A very important person, who belongs to a royal family, has sent me to ask for your help,' he went on. 'I wear a mask because nobody must know who that person is. I must explain how important this business is. If you cannot help, there will be difficulty and trouble for one of the most important families in Europe — and perhaps a very big scandal. I am talking about the famous House of Ormstein, Kings of Bohemia.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
832,"I am the King. I am Wilhelm von Ormstein, King of Bohemia. I came to see you myself because I could not ask another person to tell my story. It must be a secret. You understand?'
'Very well. Go on,' said Holmes. He closed his eyes and listened.
'Five years ago I met a woman called Irene Adler.
'Ah,' said Holmes, I hear ...' He looked at the King. 'You left her. But before you left her, you wrote her some letters perhaps. And now you want to get these letters back.'
'That's right.'
'Did you marry her?'
'No.'
""Then if she asks you for money and shows you the letters, you can say that you didn't write them.'
'But Mr Holmes, she also has my photograph.'
'You can say that you didn't give her a photograph.' 'We were both in the photograph.'
'Oh dear. That was a mistake, Your Majesty.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
833,"The King continued his story. 'I am going to marry Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You know, of course, that we are two of the most important royal families in Europe. Clotilde will never marry me if she learns that I have been a friend of Irene Adler. You do not know Irene Adler. She's a beautiful woman, but she can be as hard as a man. She was angry when I left her, and so she doesn't want me to marry another woman. We must find the photograph before she sends it!'
'I am sure that we will find it,' said Holmes. 'You are, of course, staying in London? I will write to you to tell you what happens. And, the money . . .?'
The King put a large heavy bag on the table. 'There is one thousand pounds here. If you need more, you must ask at once. The money is not important.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
834,"When I arrived the next day, Holmes was not there, so I waited in his room. At four o'clock the door opened, and a very strange servant came in. He wore old, dirty clothes, and I had to look very hard before I saw that it was my old friend.
'Holmes!' I cried. 'Where have you been?'
'I've had a very good day,' he replied with a smile. 'I've been outside Miss Irene Adler's house. Servants are always happy to talk, and so I have heard a lot about the young woman. For example, she has a good-looking man friend called Godfrey Norton, a lawyer, who often visits her. Now why? If he's her lawyer, perhaps she's already given him the photograph. But if he loves her, she won't show him the photograph.'
'Most interesting, Holmes!' I said.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
835,"While I was near Miss Irene Adler's house, Mr. Norton himself suddenly arrived. I watched them through the windows. When he left, he jumped into a taxi. ""To the church of St Monica, as fast as you can!"" he shouted. Two minutes later Miss Adler ran out of her house, jumped into another taxi and called, ""To the church of St Monica, quickly!"" I couldn't miss this, Watson, so I jumped into a third taxi. When I arrived, I went into the church. Godfrey Norton looked round and saw me.
""Thank God!"" he shouted. ""Come here quickly!"" ""Why?"" I asked. ""Come on, man, we need you!"" And so I helped Godfrey Norton to marry Irene Adler. They needed a witness, and a servant from the street was better than nobody. So she's married him!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
836,"That evening Holmes again wore different clothes, and a large, black hat. But it was not just the clothes that were different. He changed his face, his hair - everything. He was a different man.
We walked together to Serpentine Avenue. Outside the house there were a lot of people who were smoking, laughing and talking. Holmes and I walked up and down in front of the house.
'You see,' said Holmes to me, 'I think Irene Adler doesn't want her new husband to see the photograph. But where is it? At her bank? No. Women like to keep important things themselves. I'm sure it's in her house.'
'But the King's men tried to find it!' I said.
'Yes, but they didn't know where to look!' said Holmes.
'But how will you know?' I asked.
'I won't look. She'll show me. She'll have to.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Beginner,0
837,"My dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, You did it very well. I thought that it was a real fire, and that you were just a kind old man. But after I opened the cupboard, I began to think. I knew about the famous Sherlock Holmes. I knew your address, and I knew that the King asked you to find the photograph. So I quickly dressed as a young man and followed you home to Baker Street. I wanted to find out if you really were Sherlock Holmes. I said 'good night' to you outside your door!
My husband and I have decided to leave England. Please tell the King that I shall not show the photograph to anybody. I love my husband and he loves me. And he is a better man than the King. But here is a different photograph. And the King can keep this photograph, if he likes.
Very truly yours,Irene Norton, née Adler.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
838,"In September 1887 my wife was visiting some of her family, so I was staying with my old friend Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street. It was a windy, stormy evening, and the rain was falling heavily outside. Suddenly there was a knock at the door.
I looked at my friend in surprise. 'Who can this be?' I asked.
'If he comes on business in this weather, it's important,' said Sherlock Holmes. 'Come in!' he called.
A young man came in. He looked wet, tired and worried. 'I've come to ask for help,' he said. 'I've heard of you, Mr Holmes. People say you know everything. I don't know what to do.'
'Well, sit down,' said Holmes, 'and tell me about yourself.'
The young man sat down, put his wet feet near the fire and started telling his story.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
839,"My name is John Openshaw. My father, Joseph, had a brother, my uncle Elias, who went to live in America when he was young. He made a lot of money there. He fought against the men from the North during the Civil War. But when the South lost the war, Uncle Elias left America. So in 1869 he came back to England and went to live in a large house in the country. He was a strange, unhappy man.
'He did not want any friends,' John Openshaw went on, 'and he often drank a lot. But he liked me, and when I was twelve, I moved to Uncle Elias's house. He was very kind to me. I could go anywhere in the house. But there was one small room at the top of the house which was always locked. Nobody could go into this room. That was one of the most strange things.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
840,"One day Uncle Elias got a letter from Pondicherry in India. ""I don't know anyone in Pondicherry!"" he said, but when he opened the envelope, five little orange pips fell on to his plate. I began to laugh but stopped when I saw my uncle's white face.
""K.K.K.!"" he cried. ""Oh my God, they've found me!""
""What do you mean, uncle?"" I asked.
""Death!"" he cried, and ran upstairs.
'Uncle Elias went immediately to the secret room and took out a box which also had three Ks on it. He burnt all the papers in the box, and said to me, ""John, I know that I'm going to die soon. My brother, your father, will have all my money and my house after my death, and you will have it all when he dies. I hope you can enjoy it, but if not, give it to your worst enemy. I'm afraid that my money brings death with it.""",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
841,"Openshaw continued his story. 'I didn't understand what my uncle was talking about, and nothing happened for a few weeks, so I did not feel so worried. But my uncle was very afraid. He stayed in his room most of the time, and drank more than before. He always locked all the doors carefully. Then one night he drank very heavily and ran wildly out of the house, and in the morning we found him dead in a river. The police said he killed himself, but I knew he was afraid to die, so I didn't think that was true.'
'After my uncle's death, my father moved into the house. Of course I asked him to look carefully at the locked room, but we didn't find anything important.' 'Everything went well until a year later,' said John Openshaw. 'But one morning my father opened a letter to find five orange pips inside it...'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
842,"Openshaw kept telling his story. 'One day my poor father went to visit an old friend who lived some miles away. But he never came back. The police said that he was walking home in the dark when he fell down a hill. He was badly hurt, and he died soon after. They decided it was an accident, but I didn't agree. I thought it was murder, and I could not forget the five orange pips and the strange letters to my uncle and my father.
'But I've tried to forget, and I've lived alone in that house for nearly three years now. Then yesterday I got this.'
The young man showed us an envelope with K.K.K. on the back, and five small orange pips.
'You see?' he said. 'It comes from East London, and it says ""Put the papers in the garden"". Those are the words that were in the letter to my father.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
843,"Sherlock Holmes sat silently, and watched the fire. Then he said to me, 'John Openshaw is in real danger. Why did his Uncle Elias have to leave America? Because he had enemies. When he came back to England he was afraid. That's why he lived a lonely life and locked all his doors so carefully. Now where did those letters come from?
'The first from Pondicherry in India, the second from Dundee in Scotland and the third from East London.'
'Does that tell you anything?' asked Holmes.
'They're all sea ports. The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,' I replied. 'Somebody sent some pips from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill Uncle Elias, then it was John's father. Do you see why I'm worried now? He has sent pips to John from Londonl John's enemy is in London already!'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
844,"Holmes explained evething to me, 'Killers belong to the Ku Klux Klan. That why they used the ""K.K.K."". Haven't you ever heard of it? It's a very secret group of Americans from the South. They wanted to stop equality for black people and to kill anyone who didn't agree with them. The police couldn't stop them. But in 1869 Uncle Elias, who belonged to this secret group, suddenly left America with all their papers, and so the group could not go on. Of course the group wanted to get the papers back. You remember the half-burnt paper? That was Uncle Elias's American diary. While he was working for the K.K.K., he sent the pips to frighten those three men. Two left the country, but one didn't, so the K.K.K. ""finished business with him"", or killed him. The K.K.K. always worked like that.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
845,"The next morning we read in the newspaper that John Openshaw was dead. A policeman found him in the river near Waterloo station. The police said it was an accident, but Holmes was very angry about it.
'He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!' he said to me, and he hurried out of the house.
In the evening, when he came back to Baker Street, he was tired, but pleased. 'Watson!' he said, 'I know the names of Openshaw's enemies! And now I'm going to send them a surprise! This will frighten them!' He took five pips from an orange and put them in an envelope. On it he wrote 'S.H. for J.C.'
'I'm sending the pips, not from the K.K.K., but from me, Sherlock Holmes, to Captain James Calhoun.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Intermediate,2
846,"One day, in the autumn of 1890,I decided to visit Sherlock Holmes.
But when I arrived at his apartment, I found he already had a visitor.
This visitor was an old man. He was fat, with a red face. But the most unusual thing about him was his hair. The colour of the old man's hair was bright red.
'I'm sorry, Holmes,' I said. 'I didn't know you were busy. I'll wait in the next room.'
But Holmes didn't want me to leave. He pulled me into the room and closed the door.
'This is my friend, Dr Watson,' he said to the old man. 'Dr Watson has helped me with many cases. Perhaps he can also help me with yours.'
This is Mr Jabez Wilson,' went on Holmes.
'Mr Wilson, could you please tell your story again from the beginning. I'd like Dr Watson to hear it.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
847,"Mr Wilson started his story.
'I have a small shop in Saxe-Coburg Square, in the City of London. But business hasn't been good for some time and I don't make much money any more. I used to have two assistants, but now I only pay one, and he's willing to work for half-pay.'
'That's very unusual,' said Holmes. 'What's the name of your assistant?'
'Spaulding. He is very interested in photography and takes a lot of photographs. He develops these photographs himself, in the cellar of my shop. When he isn't working, he spends all his time down there.'
'One day, eight weeks ago, Spaulding came to me with a newspaper in his hand. It was the same newspaper that I showed you, Dr Watson and told me about the Red-headed League. He also said that I could become a member and make a lot of money.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
848,"At quarter past nine that evening, I set off for Baker Street, where Holmes lived. When I arrived, I noticed two carriages standing outside Holmes' door.
Inside his apartment, Holmes was talking with two men. One of them was Peter Jones, a police detective. The other man was tall and thin, with a sad-looking face.
'Hello, Watson,' said Holmes. 'I think you already know Mr Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce Mr Merryweather. Mr Merryweather is also coming with us tonight.'
'I hope it's important,' said Mr Merryweather sadly. 'I usually play cards with friends on Saturday evenings. I have played cards every Saturday night for the last twenty-seven years.'
'I think,' said Sherlock Holmes, 'that tonight you'll play a more exciting game than cards. We may catch a famous criminal.'",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
849,"It's time to go now,' said Holmes. 'Two carriages are waiting. You two take the first carriage and Watson and I will follow in the second.'
The carriages went quickly through the dark streets. I wondered where we were going.
'We're nearly there,' Holmes said to me, at last. 'This man, Merryweather, is a bank manager. I wanted Jones to come with us, too. He's a good man. He's not very clever, but he is very brave. Ah, here we are.'
We were in the same busy street which Holmes and I had visited earlier in the day. We got out of the carriages and Mr Merryweather took us down to a small side door of the bank.
Then he took us down some steps and through the gate. At last, we were in a large cellar with boxes full of gold.",the adventures of sherlock holmes,3,Advanced,4

He spoke to her and then turned quickly away and spoke to one of his friends, but he was not cold and he was not friendly to her. After a minute or two, he turned to her again.
'You are going home, I see, Miss Elliot, but it is raining and you have no coat. Can I help you to find a carriage? You cannot walk home in the rain.'

'Yes. You are right. We must leave Kellynch Hall and find a smaller house to live in. Perhaps we can look for a house in Bath. A lot of interesting, rich families live in Bath!'
Anne listened. She was not happy. She did not like Bath she remembered her three unhappy years at school there, after her mother died. But they didn't ask Anne. Sir Walter was not interested in Anne.

I put on some clothes and opened the door. There was a candle on the floor outside my room. The candle was burning. There was thick smoke in the corridor. I looked around.

Many hunters had tried to kill the beast, but none had succeeded. The Nemean Lion was also smart. Several hunters had tried to trick it with poisoned meat. The lion never ate the meat. The lion was strong. But Hercules was stronger. Hercules lured the beast into a trap and strangled it. He made a coat out of the lion's fur. He wore the lion's head as a helmet. With the cheers of the grateful people of Nemean ringing in his ears, Hercules headed for home, delighted with his new clothes. When King Eury saw the lion's head approaching, he went screaming into his castle. It took Hercules most of one day to convince King Eury that the lion was dead.",myths and legends,2,Advanced,4

950,"The king cobra is the world's largest venomous snake. It may grow to twice the length of a Ping-Pong table. Its venom is so powerful that elephants have died within three hours of a bite on the toe or trunk. King cobras are yellow-olive to brownish black, sometimes with lighter bands across the back. Like other cobras, the king cobra is known for its unique ""threat display."" When it is angered or disturbed, it raises its head and flares its narrow, unmarked hood. This shows its yellow or red throat, which often is striped. The king cobra can raise its head to a third of its entire length and may even move forward while upright. It is very curious by nature and often sits upright to see farther. It may be the most intelligent of all snakes.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
951,"When we think of cats, we usually think of small housecats or big cats like lions and tigers. But there are many kinds of cats of all sizes that still live in the wild. One such cat is the ocelot. The ocelot is about twice the size of a housecat. The ocelot is found in the Western Hemisphere, from Texas in the southwestern United States down to Argentina in South America. It lives in several different habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and brush. The ocelot's fur is short, smooth, and yellowish gray. There are small black spots on its head, two black stripes on each cheek, and four or five black stripes along its neck. This coat is good camouflage for the ocelot. It makes the animal hard to see in the leafy shade, for example.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3

But except for African animal parks, there are not many places left in the world where lions still run free. Today the only wild lions outside Africa are a few hundred protected in the Gir Forest National Park of northwestern India. Each pride is made up of lionesses of different ages, all of which are related, plus their cubs and one or two adult male lions. During the day lions lie in the shade or climb trees and rest on the branches. But lions become very active at night. Like other cats, they can see well in dim light and like to hunt in the dark. Lions hunt grazing animals, such as zebras, antelope, buffalo, and gazelles.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
953,"Wolves are very intelligent animals. They are also quite social, living and hunting in family packs. They have a strict ranking system, with a dominant female and male—the alpha pair—leading the pack. Only the alpha pair mate and have puppies, though the whole pack helps raise the young. Four to seven pups are born at a time. Packs have 7 to 30 members, depending on how much prey is available. Each pack patrols a home territory of 40 to more than 400 square miles. They define their territory with scent markings and with growls, barks, and their legendary howls. Even though they're not terribly fast, wolves are excellent hunters. They tackle much larger animals and can even bring down huge moose and bison.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
954,"Wolves hunt by using their keen senses and group cooperation. They work by tiring out their prey, sometimes chasing it all night. As soon as the animal has been brought down, the pack will feed. The highest-ranking members eat first and get all the tastiest bits. Wolves belong to the canine family. Their relatives include jackals, coyotes, dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs, wild dogs of Africa, and the domestic dogs people keep as pets. Scientists believe that wolves may be the original canine from which the others descended. However, only three species of wolves remain today. There are gray wolves in Europe, Asia, Canada, Alaska, and Yellowstone Park. A few hundred Ethiopian wolves live in a small part of Africa. Red wolves now survive mostly in captivity.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
955,"This roly-poly little animal has shiny black eyes that look like wet licorice candy. Its funny black nose is pressed against its face between bushy gray ears. If you found this animal in your bedroom, you might think it was a toy teddy bear. But this is a real animal (though it isn't a real bear) called the koala. It is found only in Australia. The koala drinks dew and eats nothing but leaves of the eucalyptus tree. It is famously slow-moving and gentle, and it sleeps up to 16 hours a day. Even when they're being aggressive, koalas rarely use their energy to fight. Instead, they'll make loud croaking sounds known as ""bellowing."" Koalas are related to kangaroos. Koalas carry and nurse their young in a pouch on their bellies. It's like a built-in baby basket.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
956,"When you think of pandas, you probably picture a big cuddly black-and-white bear. But there are actually two kinds of pandas: the giant panda and the lesser panda. The giant panda is the familiar black-and-white animal, which is found mostly in the forests of central China. The lesser panda looks rather like a raccoon. The giant panda grows to about 5 feet long and 220 pounds. Its favorite food is bamboo, and it eats almost nothing else. It needs to consume large quantities of bamboo to get the nourishment that its body needs, so it spends about 10 to 12 hours a day eating. Captive pandas, like those found in zoos, have a broader diet. In addition to bamboo, they may eat cereals, milk, and garden vegetables.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
957,"Apes are the most humanlike of all animals. Like people, apes do their work during the day and sleep at night. They also live in families and communities like we do. And like humans, apes sometimes fight each other. In the wild, some of the apes known as ""chimpanzees"" use twigs and leaves as tools. They cleverly poke a twig inside the nests of ants and termites. Then they pull up the twig and eat the insects that cling to it. They make leaf cups to scoop up water. They also use leaves and twigs to clean themselves. There are two types of apes: great apes and lesser apes. The great apes include orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. The lesser apes include gibbons and siamangs. Apes live mostly in the tropical forests of Africa and Asia.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
958,"The kiwi is a strange flightless bird found only in the forests of the island nation of New Zealand. During the day it sleeps in its burrow, and at night it looks for food. Kiwis eat worms, insects, larvae, spiders, and berries. Kiwis have a strong sense of smell, which they use to hunt. The kiwi's bill is long and narrow. Having their noses at the very end of their bills is a big help when they are hunting! Kiwis also have a good sense of hearing, though they have poor vision in daylight. To escape enemies they rely on their strong legs. Kiwis are fast runners and fierce fighters. They have four toes on each foot, each with a large claw. The claws are very useful when kiwis are facing enemies.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
959,"Did you know that a camel's hump is like a lunch box? After a good feed, a camel changes the extra food and water into fat and keeps it safe in its hump. That is why people use them for crossing deserts. Camels don't have to stop all the time for a drink or a bite to eat. When camels do get hungry, they're definitely not hard to feed. Camels eat all kinds of grass and plants, even those that are dry and thorny. In fact, a hungry camel will gobble up tents, straw baskets, and even leather belts and will drink 25 gallons of water in just a few minutes! Here's an oddity: camels have a double set of eyelashes. These help to keep the camel's eyes safe from sand during desert storms. During sandstorms the camel just closes its nose while long hair protects its eyes and its ears too.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
960,"Can you tell an African elephant from an Indian elephant? First check out the ears: African elephants have much larger ears than Indian elephants. African elephants are larger and stronger and have thicker skin than their Indian cousins. In fact, African elephants are the largest animals on land. They can grow to more than 11 feet tall and 12,000 pounds! Indian elephants, found in South and Southeast Asia, are smaller, gentler, and easier to train. Most elephants in zoos and circuses are Indian. Elephants and people have long worked together. Usually, one man trains one elephant. In India, the trainer is called a mahout. In Burma, he is the oozie. Both African and Indian elephants have been used in wartime.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
961,"A yak is a heavy, strong ox with shaggy black hair and humped shoulders. Yaks and other oxen are part of the animal family that includes cattle, buffalo, antelope, and goats. They live on the high Himalayan mountain plateaus of Tibet (part of China), Nepal, and Bhutan. Yaks graze on grass and need a lot of water, often eating snow in winter. Some yaks live in the wild. But their numbers have decreased so much that soon none may be left. Bulls (male yaks) in the wild can grow as tall as six feet and may weigh twice as much as a horse. Cows (female yaks) are usually smaller and weigh less. Wild yaks live in large herds of cows, young bulls, and calves. Older bulls stay together in smaller groups.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
962,"Lemurs have lived on Earth for a very long time, but they are found only in two places: Madagascar and the Comoro Islands, off the eastern coast of Africa. Millions of years ago, the island of Madagascar broke away from the continent of Africa. On the continent the monkeys were smarter than the lemurs, and the lemurs all died out. Lemurs are mild, shy animals, but they can be very curious if there's food around. They have a better sense of smell than monkeys do, and they use it to find fruits, leaves, insects, and small birds to eat. Most of this activity takes place at night, since lemurs like to sleep during the day. Lemurs usually have only one baby at a time. The baby clings to its mother's underside and travels with her through the treetops.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
963,"Jellyfish have been around for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth. These jelly-like creatures can be found in both cold and warm waters. Some jellyfish are clear, but others can be pink, yellow, blue or purple. Jellyfish have no brain, heart, bones or eyes. They are made up of a smooth, bag-like body and tentacles armed with tiny, stinging cells. Jellyfish stings can be painful to humans and, from certain species, they can even be deadly. Jellyfish eat fish, shrimp, crabs and tiny plants. The jellyfish itself provides a tasty meal for other ocean creatures, particularly sea turtles. In some cultures around the world, people eat jellyfish, too. In China, they are considered a delicacy, and are also used in Chinese medicine.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
964,"Asian elephants are huge gray animals inhabiting Asian tropical forests. Their gray coloration conceals them in their shady habitat. Elephants' trunks, unique among living mammals, are versatile, enabling them to reach the ground, manipulate tiny objects or tear down huge tree limbs, and squirt water over their backs or into their mouths. Wide, padded feet enable them to walk quietly. Large ears help these huge animals cool off, although elephants often must retreat to the shade or water during the hottest part of the day. Asian elephants live in large blocks of forest near water sources and grasslands, habitat that has been greatly reduced in the last half century. They inhabit India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand and other Asian countries.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
965,"Flamingos are usually 42 inches long from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail, and are as tall as five feet. They weigh five to six pounds, and have a wingspan of 55 inches.
The flamingo lives in Central and South America, the West Indies, and the Galapagos Islands, in coastal salt lagoons, saltpans, and other brackish or saltwater shallows. Flamingos eat algae, mollusks, and brine-shrimps, which give them their pink color.
Pairs of males and females make mud-mound nests, and incubate only one egg for about 30 days. Chicks leave the nest after ten days, and join a group of other chicks, called a crèche, watched by a few adults. Flamingo populations remain relatively stable, despite loss of habitat due to human development.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3

Native to central China, giant pandas have come to symbolize endangered species. As few as 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat, while another 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world. The Smithsonian National Zoo's pandas are part of Panda Watch behavior study. Each day, dedicated volunteers, called Panda Watchers, monitor the pandas' behavior via the Panda Cam.

The malarial mosquito kills 1.2 million people in Africa every year. The yellow fever mosquito, is currently infecting thousands in South America with the Zika virus. However, the league table is topped by the carriers of dengue fever, including the Asian tiger mosquito: 100 million people are infected with the virus every year. Despite their appalling reputation, mosquitoes aren't born killers and don't live exclusively on blood – they also feed on nectar. However, the females need the vital fluid to produce eggs. They don't just bite human beings, but also animals – and, in doing so, are infected with numerous dangerous viruses.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
969,"Do insects really sleep? Even insects need a bit of shut-eye. Like humans, creepy-crawlies also adopt different positions when they drift off, relaxing their bodies and antennae. Scientists have found that some insects have also become accustomed to a day and night routine, only hunting for prey or visiting flowers during daylight hours. But it's not just the way they nap that makes insects similar to us – they also feel the strain of getting too little sleep. Bugs suffer from memory problems when they don't hit the hay, leading to decreased concentration and communication problems. As a result, they can become confused. While humans need around eight hours' kip a night, the exact amount of time insects require is still not known.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2
970,"The duck-billed platypus is one of the oddest animals on earth. It's a small animal native to Australia and Tasmania. Unusually, it's neither a mammal, a bird nor a reptile. For a while, scientists couldn't decide what the strange little creature was because it had similarities with all three animal groups. For years, scientists had been studying the genome of the platypus to figure out which group it belonged to. Australia is home to some of the strangest animals in the world. As well as the duck-billed platypus, there are also kangaroos with pouches for carrying their offspring and the mild, tree-climbing koala bears. The isolation of the island has meant that many animals have evolved differently from other animals as they lived without fear of predators.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4
971,"The increasing number of icebergs that are breaking off from Antarctica have become interesting new habitats. A group of American scientists say these icebergs hold important nutrients which slowly drift into the sea and attract a large number of different species of fish and seabirds. The researchers found that many rare species of seabird were using the icebergs as ""mobile homes"" and that they were a good base from which to hunt the large number of fish. A further interesting part of the study says that the increased levels of phytoplankton, which also live around the icebergs, increase the absorption of CO2 gases, meaning that the icebergs could have a positive effect on the problems caused by global warming.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
972,"Whales are mammals, so in many ways, they are just like human beings. The most important difference is that humans and whales live in different environments and whales have a special respiratory system that enables them to stay underwater for several minutes without breathing oxygen. For this reason, they are said to be voluntary breathers. That is, because of whales underwater environment, they must be conscious breathers.
What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep, whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can sleep is by remaining partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere of the whale's brain sleeps at a time, so they rest but are never completely asleep.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
973,"Rainforests are the lungs of the planet – storing vast quantities of carbon dioxide and producing a significant amount of the world's oxygen. Rainforests have their own perfect system for ensuring their own survival; the tall trees make a canopy of branches and leaves which protect themselves, smaller plants, and the forest animals from heavy rain, intense dry heat from the sun and strong winds.
Amazingly, the trees grow in such a way that their leaves and branches, although close together, never actually touch those of another tree. Scientists think this is a deliberate tactic to prevent the spread of any tree diseases and make life more difficult for leaf-eating insects like caterpillars. To survive in the forest, animals must climb, jump, fly or glide across the gaps.",wildlife wonders,3,Intermediate,2

It's true that the color of a chameleon's skin can change, but not because the chameleon decides to. The color change may help the chameleon avoid its enemies. The skin also changes color when chameleons are excited, angry, or afraid. There are many types of chameleons. About half are found only in the African island of Madagascar. The others occur mostly south of Africa's Sahara desert, with another few in western Asia and southern Europe. Chameleons live in trees, where they usually eat insects. They catch their prey with the help of their long and slender tongue. Very large chameleons may even use their sticky tongues to catch birds.",wildlife wonders,3,Upper-Intermediate,3

Gibbons are found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. Because they are well suited for tree climbing, gibbons spend most of their time traveling along branches. And they don't have to leave the trees for dinner. They eat fruit, leaves, vegetables, and insects, all of which are found in the canopy. Gibbons live in small family groups of a male, a female, and their young. The male and female ""sing"" in the morning and evening, and the males sometimes give solo performances. Gibbons are territorial, and singing lets everyone know that they are at home.",wildlife wonders,3,Advanced,4

Bats sleep in caves, the hollows of trees, and empty buildings. There are many kinds of bats, in many sizes. The flying fox bat, when it stretches its wings, is wider than you are tall. But the tiny Philippine bamboo bat's wings are barely six inches from tip to tip. Most bats eat insects. The Mexican bats of Texas can eat up millions and millions of insects every year! Other bats eat fruits, honey, and pollen. But whatever they eat, all bats look for their food at night.",wildlife wonders,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Instead, they run to keep away from their enemies. But the first thing ostriches do when they see an enemy is hide. To avoid being seen, ostriches generally lie flat on the ground with their necks outstretched. This makes them look like just another bush.

It has the ""Gentleman's Department"" on the top floor, a famous tea shop and several restaurants. The business started out small, but in 1761, William Fortnum's grandson, Charles, was contracted to work for Queen Charlotte. As a result, the royals started shopping there. During the Victorian era, the company was often asked to provide food for special occasions. Fortnum's is really famous for its hampers, which are baskets of food.

Soon enough, you have to lower your arm. It's a force called ""gravity"" that causes you to lower your arm. Gravity acts something like a magnet, tugging away at your arm as if it were a piece of metal. We can't see gravity or touch it. We can only feel it. The Earth has gravity that pulls down on everything on or near it. It is this force that keeps us all on Earth. The Moon and the Sun also have gravity. All bodies in the universe have gravity.

The life of a star spans billions of years. A star is born from clouds of dust. This cloud mass forms a spinning ball that pulls all the material toward the center. It becomes more and more dense as the material comes together. It also becomes extremely hot. Eventually it becomes so hot that the hydrogen gas begins to glow. The glowing gas ball is called a ""protostar"". A protostar becomes a star when it starts a process called fusion. The fusion process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat and light.

These planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The other planets are larger and farther away from the Sun. These planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These four planets have no solid surfaces. They are made up of gases and liquids. Each planet rotates on its axis.

Some people thought that it was a new planet. Over the next few years many more objects were seen. All of these were much smaller than a planet. Astronomers now call these objects ""asteroids,"" or minor planets. There are thousands of asteroids in our solar system. They tend to vary in shape, ranging from large spheres to smaller slabs and potato-shaped objects. Some asteroids are big. Most are the size of a boulder. Smaller asteroids form when two big asteroids smash into each other and break up. Astronomers think that there are millions of tiny asteroids in the solar system.",exploring space,1,Advanced,4

The Sun provides energy for the rest of the solar system. It also provides the heat and light necessary for life on our planet. And its gravity keeps the planets, comets, and other bodies in orbit. The planets are the largest and most massive members of the solar system after the Sun. Scientists used to think that there were nine planets. They thought that Pluto was a planet because it revolves around the Sun. But in 2006 they decided that Pluto should be called a dwarf planet. Other bodies that also orbit the Sun but are even smaller are called asteroids.",exploring space,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

Mercury is visible to the naked eye from Earth, just before dawn and just after sundown. Some regions of Mercury are covered with heavy craters, probably created when the planet ran into other bodies as it was forming. Other regions show gently rolling plains. These may have been smoothed by volcanic lava flow. The planet also features long steep cliffs called ""scarps"" in some areas. Mercury takes 88 Earth days to go around the Sun once, which gives it a very short year. But it takes 1,416 hours to complete one rotation about its axis, so it has a very long day.",exploring space,1,Advanced,4

Humans, however, could not breathe the air there. Scientists have learned that the surface of Venus is marked with hundreds of large meteor craters. These craters suggest that since it formed, the surface of Venus has changed in a different way from Earth's surface. Earth has only a few large craters that are easy to recognize. Venus is different from Earth in another way, too. It hasn't got a moon.",exploring space,1,Intermediate,2

Then came a man named Nicolaus Copernicus, who said that it was the Sun that stayed still and the Earth that moved. Copernicus didn't believe that the Earth was the center of the universe and that all the other planets and stars circled around it. He studied the sky for years and finally decided that the Sun sat at the center of the universe. The Earth and the other planets spun around the Sun. Some of what Copernicus said wasn't correct. We know today that all the planets and the stars, including the Sun, move constantly. We also know that the Sun is the center not of the universe but rather of the solar system.

Two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, orbit Mars. The first spacecraft to fly close to Mars was Mariner 4, in 1965. In the 1970s two Viking spacecraft landed there, and in July 1997 Mars Pathfinder set down. These efforts sent back from Mars soil sample reports, pictures, and other data—but no proof of life.

Helium is the gas that makes balloons float in air, and hydrogen is one part of water. The center of the planet is probably made of a hot liquid. Jupiter isn't a very welcoming place. It is extremely hot. It is thousands of times hotter than the hottest place on Earth. Also, storms rage on Jupiter's surface almost all the time.

Saturn is a gas planet, like Jupiter, Neptune, and Uranus. Very little of it is solid. It is covered with bands of colored clouds. The thin rings that surround the planet are made of water ice and ice-covered particles. Saturn takes 29 years and 5 months in Earth time to go around the Sun just once. The Earth goes around the Sun once every 365 days. Saturn's year is so much longer because the planet is so much farther away from the Sun.",exploring space,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

When William Herschel discovered this planet in March 1781, he named it Georgium Sidus (George's Star) in honor of his king, George III of England. In about 1850 scientists began to use the name Uranus. It takes Uranus 84 of Earth's years to go around the Sun once, so its year is 84 times as long as ours. But the planet takes only about 17 hours to spin on its axis once, so its day is shorter. Unlike other planets, Uranus lies on its side at an odd angle. It points first one pole toward the Sun, then its equator, and then the other pole. So it is not yet clear which is the planet's ""north"" pole.",exploring space,1,Upper-Intermediate,3

The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846, but little was known about it until the spacecraft Voyager 2 visited it in August 1989. Neptune is made up mostly of gases. Like other gas planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune has rapid winds and big storms. The winds on Neptune are the fastest known in our solar system, reaching speeds of about 1,250 miles per hour. The planet rotates quickly, once every 16.1 hours. This means its day is about two-thirds as long as ours. But it has a much longer year. There are about 60,225 days in one Neptune year. That's how many days it takes the planet to orbit the Sun. Each season on Neptune lasts for 41 Earth years.",exploring space,1,Intermediate,2

Pluto is so mysterious that scientists have not been sure what kind of body it is. For many years they called it a planet, but it is different from the other planets. Tiny Pluto's diameter is only about 1,485 miles. It's not entirely clear what Pluto is made of, but scientists think it may be 50 to 75 percent rock and the rest frozen water and gases.

Calendar making was a difficult job because certain church holy days had to happen just as a particular star was in a particular spot in the sky. In 1597 Kepler published his first important work, The Cosmographic Mystery. Kepler's book explained the distance of the planets from the Sun.

From biggest to smallest, they are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Some continents, such as Australia and Antarctica, are completely surrounded by water. And some continents are joined together, as Asia and Europe are. Earth scientists believe that the continents began forming billions of years ago. Lighter parts of Earth's molten core separated from heavier parts and rose to the top. As they cooled off and became solid, the land that would become the continents formed.

At its thickest point, the ice is almost 3 miles deep—and that's on top of the ground. The continent contains most of the world's ice and much of the world's freshwater. Strange and wonderful Antarctica has only one day in the entire year. The Sun generally rises on September 21 and sets on March 22. This one long day is the summer!

They are difficult places to live in, and the few plants, animals, and people who live there have to be tough to survive. Every continent except Europe has a desert. Even Antarctica has one, a frigid desert. Most deserts, however, are arid, or dry, deserts with mile after mile of sand, baked earth, and barren rock. In the daytime these places look like lost worlds—hot, dry, and silent. Usually, the only plants growing there are low thorny ones. These plants store most of the water they are able to collect.

You can hear the animals squeaking and growling near water holes and springs. That's where the coyotes, badgers, bobcats, foxes, and birds gather, all hunting for food and water. When the rare spring does bubble up in the desert, plants and trees begin to grow. An island of green like this is called an ""oasis."" Many people choose to live in the desert.

The falls span the entire breadth of the Zambezi River at one of its broadest points. There is a constant roaring sound as the river falls. A dense blanket of mist covers the entire area. The Kalolo-Lozi people who live in the area call this mist Mosi-oa-Tunya, ""the Smoke That Thunders.""

1187,"Did you know that nearly three-fourths of the Earth's surface is underwater? And almost all of that water is in one of the four major oceans. From biggest to smallest the oceans are: the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Arctic. Seas, such as the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, are divisions of the oceans. The oceans are in constant motion. The gravity of the Moon and the Sun pulls on the oceans, causing tides—the regular rising and falling of the ocean along beaches and coastlines. The Earth's rotation makes the oceans circulate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. And winds cause waves to ripple across the ocean surface, as well as helping currents to flow underneath.",planet earth,3,Advanced,4

The largest islands contain whole countries. If you live in England, Iceland, Australia, or Japan, you live on an island. How do islands develop in the first place? Some islands begin as fiery volcanoes in the ocean. Hot lava pours out of the volcano, making the island bigger and bigger. These are the volcanic islands. Maybe most surprising are the islands that are built up from the bottom of the ocean from the skeletons of tiny sea animals called ""coral."" As some corals die, others live on top of them. After thousands of years a coral island rises to the ocean surface.",planet earth,3,Intermediate,2

Altogether there are 2,100 individual reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. This huge ridge of coral reefs is separated from land by a channel of water 30 miles wide. The Great Barrier Reef was formed over millions of years from mounds of coral. A coral is a soft animal that supports its body inside a hard hollow shell. When the coral died, its shell remained, and other corals grew on top of it. Over those millions of years, the corals remained hardened and became cemented together. Slowly they were covered with underwater plants, debris from the ocean, and other corals.",planet earth,3,Advanced,4

But over many, many years Gondwanaland slowly broke up into the continents of South America, Africa, Antarctica, and Australia, as well as most of India. The water that filled the growing space between these continents is now the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean is a huge body of salt water. It is the third largest ocean in the world— about five and a half times the size of the United States! People from India, Egypt, and ancient Phoenicia (now mostly in Lebanon) were the first to explore this ocean. Later, Arabian merchants set up trade routes to the east coast of Africa. And Indian traders and priests carried their civilization into the East Indies.",planet earth,3,Intermediate,2

The Pacific Ocean lies between the continents of Asia and Australia on the west and North and South America on the east. The Pacific's deepest parts are the ocean trenches. These trenches are long, narrow, steep, and very deep holes at the bottom of the ocean. Of the 20 major trenches in the world, 17 are in the Pacific Ocean. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench. Part of the trench is nearly 7 miles deep. There are also many islands in the Pacific Ocean. Some islands were once part of the continents.

1192,"The genesis of Earth took place at a chaotic time. While our planet has now carved out its own path, a gigantic cloud of gas and dust whirled around 4.5 billion years ago, condensing to form heavenly bodies. It was the age of Theia – a planet that eventually struck Earth, was badly damaged and then fell apart. According to textbooks, our moon was formed from the ruins of this small world. But the story must be rewritten, at least if you believe cosmochemist Edward Young. He and his team have completed a sensational study into the collision of the two planets – and have shown that the impact could have been the starting point for life on Earth. According to Young, Theia didn't just crash into Earth and form the moon – it collided with Earth with such force that the two planets became one.",planet earth,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1193,"Theia was sort of like Earth's little sister – both planets were formed at the same time and at the same distance from the sun. Even after their birth, they remained close and shared an orbit around the sun. Theia was a trojan (a minor planet that shares the orbit of a larger planet) and made itself comfortable on the Lagrange point of Earth's orbit. It's a kind of gravitational gap between Earth and the sun that not only offered Theia shelter, but also billions of tons of debris. Theia picked up more and more of this space muck – until it became so massive that it slowed down. It then lurched to the side and rammed into Earth at a speed of around 45,000 km/h. That was the end of Earth's sister. However, it was a fresh start for our planet – and the beginning of life as we know it.",planet earth,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1194,"The moon's influence is very large: today, the moon does nothing less than guarantee life on Earth. It moderates the climate, stabilises Earth's axis like an anchor and keeps its angular momentum in check. Without the moon, storms with speeds of up to 560 km/h would sweep over Earth and a day would last just eight hours – not exactly ideal conditions for life. Experts estimate that 80% of all mammal species and 70% of plant species would immediately become extinct without the moon. However, despite its central importance, the moon isn't the only bedrock of life that Theia left behind. Earth's sister became part of Earth itself – increasing its size. Without this merger, Earth wouldn't have had enough mass and gravitational pull to develop an atmosphere.",planet earth,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1195,"If a big asteroid hit the moon, what consequences would it have for Earth? What would happen to the oceans? A very large asteroid could possibly knock the moon out of its orbit and send debris flying towards Earth. Apart from the craters this would cause on our planet's surface, it could generate a dust cloud that blocks out the sun. Even a small change in the moon's orbit could result in tide levels altering dramatically – causing widespread flooding in cities such as London and New York – climate change and even shorter days. However, there's no need to panic yet – scientists have calculated that, for this to occur, the asteroid would have to be absolutely huge – around the size of the moon. Luckily, there are no such objects nearby.",planet earth,3,Advanced,4

If you look at the Earth as a geographer does, then you might see it as a colorful map. Much more than half of it is blue with oceans, lakes, rivers, and streams. In some places it is tan-colored with the sands of dry deserts. In other places it is green with forests. There are purple-gray mountains and white snowcapped peaks. Part of learning about the Earth is learning where people can and can't live. The different colors of your Earth map can help you discover this. You won't find many people in the tan, white, or larger blue parts—deserts, the snowfields, and oceans.",planet earth,3,Intermediate,2
1197,"Several different processes contribute to mountain building. And most mountains are formed by a combination of these, usually over millions of years. Deep inside, the Earth is so incredibly hot that everything is melted, or molten. This molten material, or lava, escapes to the Earth's surface when volcanoes erupt. The lava cools and becomes hard and solid. This happens again and again, collecting until there is a volcanic mountain. Mount Fuji in Japan is a volcanic mountain. Other mountains were pushed up from the bottom of an ocean when two enormous portions of the Earth crashed together—very slowly, over millions and millions of years. Some of the largest mountain chains formed this way. The Andes of South America are an example.",planet earth,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1198,"Caves are natural openings in the Earth large enough for a person to get in. Most have been made when rainwater or streams have worn away rock—usually a softer rock such as limestone. The wearing-away process is called ""erosion."" Slowly, over millions of years, the water works away at the soft rock, making a small tunnel-like opening. As more and more rock wears away, the opening grows wider and deeper. In time, many of these openings become huge caves, or caverns. Some caves have beautiful craggy formations called ""stalactites,"" like those pictured here, that hang from the cave's roof. These are made by water seeping into the cave. Each drop leaves a very tiny bit of dissolved rock on the ceiling of the cave. After thousands and thousands of years, an icicle-shaped stalactite forms.",planet earth,3,Intermediate,2

The state of Alaska qualifies as one and has several smaller peninsulas of its own. Another famous peninsula is the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. It is triangular in shape.

""Out to the hoghouse,"" replied Mrs. Arable. ""Some pigs were born last night.""
""I don't see why he needs an ax,"" continued Fern, who was only eight.
""Well,"" said her mother, ""one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it.""
""Do away with it?"" shrieked Fern. ""You mean kill it? Just because it's smaller than the others?""
Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. ""Don't yell, Fern!"" she said. ""Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway.""

Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.
""Fern,"" said Mr. Arable, ""I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!""
""But it's unfair,"" cried Fern. ""The pig couldn't help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?""

""Put it on her chair!"" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel.
Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4

He was heavily armed - an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other.
""What's that?"" he demanded. ""What's Fern got?""
""She's got a guest for breakfast,"" said Mrs. Arable. ""Wash your hands and face, Avery!""

""Let's have breakfast,"" said Fern's mother.
But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink of milk.
Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. ""Give him his breakfast!"" she said.
A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig had a good appetite and caught on quickly.

Every afternoon, when the school bus stopped in front of her house, she jumped out and ran to the kitchen to fix another bottle for him. She fed him again at suppertime, and again just before going to bed. Mrs. Arable gave him a feeding around noontime each day, when Fern was away in school. Wilbur loved his milk, and he was never happier than when Fern was warming up a bottle for him. He would stand and gaze up at her with adoring eyes.
For the first few days of his life, Wilbur was allowed to live in a box near the stove in the kitchen.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1306,"It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for a small pig - Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased.
""Won't he be cold at night?"" asked Fern.
""No,"" said her father. ""You watch and see what he does.""
Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1307,"Every morning after breakfast, Wilbur, the pig, walked out to the road with Fern and waited with her till the bus came. She would wave good-bye to him, and he would stand and watch the bus until it vanished around a turn. While Fern was in school, Wilbur was shut up inside his yard. But as soon as she got home in the afternoon, she would take him out and he would follow her around the place. If she went into the house, Wilbur went, too. If she went upstairs, Wilbur would wait at the bottom step until she came down again. If she took her doll for a walk in the doll carriage, Wilbur followed along. Sometimes, on these journeys, Wilbur would get tired, and Fern would pick him up and put him in the carriage alongside the doll. He liked this.",charlotte's web,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1308,"The pig's new home was in the lower part of the barn, directly underneath the cows. Mr. Zuckerman knew that a manure pile is a good place to keep a young pig. Pigs need warmth, and it was warm and comfortable down there in the barn cellar on the south side.
Fern came almost every day to visit her pig - Wilbur. She found an old milking stool that had been discarded, and she placed the stool in the sheepfold next to Wilbur's pen. Here she sat quietly during the long afternoons, thinking and listening and watching Wilbur. The sheep soon got to know her and trust her.
So did the geese, who lived with the sheep. All the animals trusted her, she was so quiet and friendly. It made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made Wilbur happy to know that she was sitting there, right outside his pen.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1309,"One afternoon in June, when the pig - Wilbur was almost two months old, he wandered out into his small yard outside the barn. Fern had not arrived for her usual visit. Wilbur stood in the sun feeling lonely and bored.
""There's never anything to do around here,"" he thought. He walked slowly to his food trough and sniffed to see if anything had been overlooked at lunch. He found a small strip of potato skin and ate it. His back itched, so he leaned against the fence and rubbed against the boards.
When he tired of this, he walked indoors, climbed to the top of the manure pile, and sat down. He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of lying down. ""I'm less than two months old and I'm tired of living,"" he said. He walked out to the yard again.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1310,"The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.
Rain upset Wilbur's plans. Wilbur had planned to go out, this day, and dig a new hole in his yard. He had other plans, too. His plans for the day went something like this: Breakfast at six-thirty. Skim milk, crusts, middlings, wheat cakes with drops of maple syrup sticking to them, potato skins, leftover custard pudding with raisins, and bits of Shredded Wheat.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1311,"Wilbur had gone to sleep thinking about these plans. He awoke at six, and saw the rain, and it seemed as though he couldn't bear it.
""I get everything all beautifully planned out and it has to go and rain,"" he said.
For a while he stood gloomily indoors. Then he walked to the door and looked out. Drops of rain struck his face. His yard was cold and wet. His trough had an inch of rainwater in it. Templeton was nowhere to be seen.
""Are you out there, Templeton?"" called Wilbur. There was no answer. Suddenly Wilbur felt lonely and friendless.
""One day just like another,"" he groaned. ""I'm very young, I have no real friend here in the barn, it's going to rain all morning and all afternoon, and Fern won't come in such bad weather. Oh, honestly!"" And Wilbur was crying again.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1312,"At six-thirty Wilbur heard the banging of a pail. Lurvy was standing outside in the rain, stirring up breakfast.
""C'mon, pig!"" said Lurvy.
Wilbur did not budge. Lurvy dumped the slops, scraped the pail, and walked away. He noticed that something was wrong with the pig. Wilbur didn't want food, he wanted love. He wanted a friend - someone who would play with him.
Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think there's something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn't touched his food.""
""Give him two spoonfuls of sulphur and a little molasses,"" said Mr. Zuckerman.
Wilbur couldn't believe what was happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1313,"The night seemed long. The pig's stomach was empty and his mind was full. And when your stomach is empty and your mind is full, it's always hard to sleep.
A dozen times during the night Wilbur woke and stared into the blackness, listening to the sounds and trying to figure out what time it was. A barn is never perfectly quiet. Even at midnight there is usually something stirring.
The first time he woke, he heard Templeton gnawing a hole in the grain bin. Templeton's teeth scraped loudly against the wood and made quite a racket. ""That crazy rat!"" thought Wilbur. ""Why does he have to stay up all night, destroying people's property?""
Wilbur yawned and went back to sleep. In his dreams he heard again the voice saying, ""I'll be a friend to you. Go to sleep - you'll see me in the morning.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1314,"The barn was still dark. The sheep lay motionless. Even the goose was quiet. Overhead, on the main floor, nothing stirred: the cows were resting, the horses dozed. Templeton had quit work and gone off somewhere on an errand. The only sound was a slight scraping noise from the rooftop, where the weather-vane swung back and forth. The pig loved the barn when it was like this calm and quiet, waiting for light.
""Day is almost here,"" he thought. Through a small window, a faint gleam appeared. One by one the stars went out. Wilbur could see the goose a few feet away. She sat with head tucked under a wing. Then he could see the sheep and the lambs. The sky lightened.
""Oh, beautiful day, it is here at last! Today I shall find my friend.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1315,"Wilbur - the pig tried to find his new friend. He searched his pen thoroughly. He examined the window ledge, stared up at the ceiling. But he saw nothing new. Finally, he decided he would have to speak up. He hated to break the lovely stillness of day by using his voice, but he couldn't think of any other way to locate the mysterious new friend who was nowhere to be seen. So Wilbur cleared his throat.
""Attention, please!"" he said in a loud, firm voice. ""Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night kindly make himself or herself known by giving an appropriate sign or signal!""
Wilbur paused and listened. All the other animals lifted their heads and stared at him. Wilbur blushed. But he was determined to get in touch with his unknown friend.
He did not know it, but his friend was very near, but he was asleep.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1316,"""Salutations!"" said the voice.
Wilbur - the pig jumped to his feet. ""Salu-what?"" he cried.
""Salutations!"" repeated the voice.
""What are they, and where are you?"" screamed Wilbur. ""Please, please, tell me where you are. And what are salutations?""
""Salutations are greetings,"" said the voice. ""When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the doorway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!""
At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
1317,"Good morning! Salutations! Very pleased to meet you. What is your name, please? May I have your name?""
""My name,"" said the spider, ""is Charlotte."" ""Charlotte what?"" asked Wilbur, eagerly.
""Charlotte A. Cavatica. But just call me Charlotte."" ""I think you're very beautiful,"" said Wilbur - the pig.
""Well, I am pretty,"" replied Charlotte. ""There's no denying that. Almost all spiders are rather nice-looking. I'm not as flashy as some, but I'll do. I wish I could see you, Wilbur, as clearly as you can see me.""
""Yes, but I'm near-sighted,"" replied Charlotte. ""I've always been dreadfully near-sighted. It's good in some ways, not so good in others."" Charlotte stood quietly over the fly, preparing to eat it.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1318,"Wilbur-the pig lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired from his wakeful night and from the excitement of meeting someone for the first time. A breeze brought him the smell of clover - the sweet-smelling world beyond his fence. ""Well,"" he thought, ""I've got a new friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is!
Charlotte is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty - everything I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even though she is pretty and, of course, clever?""
Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears that often go with finding a new friend. In good time he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte. Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior, she had a kind heart, and she was to prove loyal and true to the very end.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1319,"Wilbur liked the spider better and better each day. Her campaign against insects seemed sensible and useful. Hardly anybody around the farm had a good word to say for a fly. Flies spent their time pestering others. The cows hated them. The horses detested them. The sheep loathed them.
Mr. and Mrs. Zuckerman were always complaining about them, and putting up screens. Wilbur admired the way Charlotte managed. He was particularly glad that she always put her victim to sleep before eating it.
As the days went by, Wilbur grew and grew. He ate three big meals a day. He spent long hours lying on his side, half asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams. He enjoyed good health and he gained a lot of weight.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1320,"One afternoon, when Fern was sitting on her stool, the oldest sheep walked into the barn, and stopped to pay a call on Wilbur-the pig.
""Hello!"" she said. ""Seems to me you're putting on weight.""
""Yes, I guess I am,"" replied Wilbur. ""At my age it's a good idea to keep gaining.""
""Just the same, I don't envy you,"" said the old sheep. ""You know why they're fattening you up, don't you?""
""No,"" said Wilbur.
""Well, I don't like to spread bad news,"" said the sheep, ""but they're fattening you up because they're going to kill you, that's why.""
""They're going to what?"" screamed Wilbur. Fern grew rigid on her stool.
""Kill you. Turn you into smoked bacon and ham,"" continued the old sheep. ""Almost all young pigs get murdered by the farmer as soon as the real cold weather sets in.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1321,"Day after day the spider waited, head-down, for an idea to come to her. Hour by hour she sat motionless, deep in thought. Having promised Wilbur that she would save his life, she was determined to keep her promise. Charlotte was naturally patient.
She knew from experience that if she waited long enough, a fly would come to her web; and she felt sure that if she thought long enough about Wilbur's problem, an idea would come to her mind.
Finally, one morning toward the middle of July, the idea came.
""Why, how perfectly simple!"" she said to herself.
""The way to save Wilbur's life is to play a trick on Zuckerman. If I can fool a bug,"" thought Charlotte, ""I can surely fool a man. People are not as smart as bugs.""",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1322,"Wilbur walked into his yard just at that moment.
""What are you thinking about, Charlotte? "" he asked.
""I was just thinking,"" said the spider, ""that people are very gullible."" ""What does 'gullible' mean?""
""Easy to fool,"" said Charlotte.
""That's a mercy,"" replied Wilbur, and he lay down in the shade of his fence and went fast asleep. The spider, however, stayed wide awake, gazing affectionately at him and making plans for his future. Summer was half gone. She knew she didn't have much time.
That morning, just as Wilbur fell asleep, Avery Arable wandered into the Zuckerman's front yard, followed by Fern. Avery carried a live frog in his hand. Fern had a crown of daisies in her hair. The children ran for the kitchen to eat some pie.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1323,"Later on that morning, the animals came up from the pasture - the sheep, the lambs, the gander, the goose, and the seven goslings. There were many complaints about the awful smell, and Wilbur had to tell the story over and over again, of how the Arable boy had tried to capture Charlotte, and how the smell of the broken egg drove him away just in time.
""It was that rotten goose egg that saved Charlotte's life,"" said Wilbur. The goose was proud of her share in the adventure.
""I'm delighted that the egg never hatched,"" she gabbled.
Templeton, of course, was miserable over the loss of his beloved egg. But he couldn't resist boasting.
""It pays to save things,"" he said inhis surly voice. ""A rat never knows when something is going to, come in handy. I never throw anything away.""",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1324,"Lurvy felt weak. He brushed his hand across his eyes and stared harder at Charlotte's web.
""I'm seeing things,"" he whispered. He dropped to his knees and uttered a short prayer. Then, forgetting all about Wilbur's breakfast, he walked back to the house and called Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think you'd better come down to the pigpen,"" he said.
""What's the trouble?"" asked Mr. Zuckerman.
""Come and see for yourself,"" said Lurvy.
The two men walked silently down to Wilbur's yard. Lurvy pointed to the spider's web. ""Do you see what I see?"" he asked.
Zuckerman stared at the writing on the web. Then he murmured the words ""Some Pig."" Then he looked at Lurvy. Then they both began to tremble. Charlotte, sleepy after her night's exertions, smiled as she watched. Wilbur came and stood directly under the web.",charlotte's web,1,Intermediate,2
1325,"Wilbur was pleased to receive so much attention. Lurvy was still standing there, and Mr. and Mrs. Zuckerman all three, stood for about an hour, reading the words on the web over and over, and watching Wilbur.
Charlotte sat without moving a muscle, and listened to the conversation of the people. When a small fly blundered into the web, just beyond the word pig,"" Charlotte dropped quickly down, rolled the fly up, and carried it out of the way.
After a while the fog lifted. The web dried off and the words didn't show up so plainly. The Zuckermans and Lurvy walked back to the house. Just before they left the pigpen, Mr. Zuckerman took one last look at Wilbur.
""He's long, and he's smooth,"" said Zuckerman.
""That's right,"" agreed Lurvy. ""He's as smooth as they come. He's some pig.""",charlotte's web,1,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1326,"Secrets are hard to keep. Long before Sunday came, the news spread all over the county. Everybody knew that a sign had appeared in a spider's web on the Zuckerman place. Everybody knew that the Zuckermans had a wondrous pig. People came from miles around to look at Wilbur and to read the words on Charlotte's web. The news of the wonderful pig spread clear up into the hills, and farmers came rattling down in buggies and buckboards, to stand hour after hour at Wilbur's pen admiring the miraculous animal. All said they had never seen such a pig before in their lives.
When Fern told her mother that Avery had tried to hit the Zuckermans' spider with a stick, Mrs. Arable was so shocked that she sent Avery to bed without any supper, as punishment.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4

When Lurvy arrived with breakfast, there was the handsome pig, and over him, woven neatly in block letters, was the word TERRIFIC. Another miracle.
Lurvy rushed and called Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Zuckerman rushed and called Mrs. Zuckerman. Mrs. Zuckerman ran to the phone and called the Arables. The Arables climbed into their truck and hurried over. Everybody stood at the pigpen and stared at the web and read the word, over and over, while Wilbur, who really felt terrific, stood quietly swelling out his chest and swinging his snout from side to side.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4
1328,"The news spread. People who had journeyed to see Wilbur when he was ""some pig"" came back again to see him now that he was ""terrific.""
That afternoon, when Mr. Zuckerman went to milk the cows and clean out the tie-ups, he was still thinking about what a wondrous pig he owned.
""Lurvy! "" he called. ""There is to be no more cow manure thrown down into that pigpen. I have a terrific pig. I want that pig to have clean, bright straw every day for his bedding. Understand?""
""Yes, sir,"" said Lurvy.
""Furthermore,"" said Mr. Zuckerman, ""I want you to start building a crate for Wilbur. I have decided to take the pig to the County Fair on September sixth. Make the crate large and paint it green with gold letters!""",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3
1329,"Tired from his romp, Wilbur lay down in the clean straw. He closed his eyes. The straw seemed scratchy - not as comfortable as the cow manure, which was always delightfully soft to lie in. So he pushed the straw to one side and stretched out in the manure. Wilbur sighed. It had been a busy day - his first day of being terrific. Dozens of people had visited his yard during the afternoon, and he had had to stand and pose, looking as terrific as he could. Now he was tired. Fern had arrived and seated herself quietly on her stool in the corner.

1350,"Before I begin my story, I would like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York in the north of England. My father was German, but he came to live and work in England. Soon after that, he married my mother, who was English. Her family name was Robinson, so, when I was born, they called me Robinson, after her. My father wanted me to get a good job and live a quiet, comfortable life. But I didn't want that. I wanted adventure and an exciting life.
'I want to be a sailor and go to sea,' I told my mother and father.
They were very unhappy about this. About a year later, I saw a friend in town. His father had a ship and so, on September 1st, 1651, I went to Hull, and the next day we sailed for London.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1351,"For two long years I was a slave. I worked in the house and the garden, and every day I planned to escape, but it was impossible. I thought about it day and night. My master liked to go fishing in a little boat, and he always took me with him. A man, called Moely, and a young boy also went with us.
One day my master said to us, 'Some of my friends want to go fishing tomorrow. Get the boat ready.'
So we put a lot of food and drink on the boat, and the next morning, we waited for my master and his friends. But when my master arrived, he was alone.
'My friends don't want to go fishing today,' he said to me. 'But you'll go and catch some fish for our supper tonight.'
'Yes, master,' I answered quietly, but inside I was excited. 'Perhaps now I can escape,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1352,"That day I was lucky, and the sea carried me to the shore. I could not see the land, only mountains of water all around me.
Then, suddenly, I felt the ground under my feet. Another mountain of water came, pushed me up the beach, and I fell on the wet sand. At first I was very thankful to be alive. Slowly, I got to my feet and went higher up the shore. From there, I looked out to sea. I could see our ship, but it was wrecked and there was nobody near it.
There was nobody in the water. All my friends were dead. I was alive, but in a strange wild country, with no food, no water, and no gun. It was dark now and I was tired. I was afraid to sleep on the shore. Perhaps there were wild animals there. So I went up into a tree and I stayed there all night.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1353,"I looked around the ship, and after a few minutes, I found some long pieces of wood. I wanted to bring them to the shore. So I tied them together with rope. Then I got the things that I wanted from the ship. There was a big box of food - rice, and salted meat, and hard ship's bread. I also took many strong knives and other tools - the ship's sails and ropes, paper, pens, books, and seven guns. Now I needed a little sail from the ship, and then I was ready. Slowly and carefully, I went back to the shore. It was difficult to stop my things from falling into the sea, but in the end I got everything on to the shore.
Now I needed somewhere to keep my things. There were some hills around me, so I decided to build myself a little house on one of them.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1354,"The next day I thought about the possible dangers on the island. Were there wild animals, and perhaps wild people too, on my island? I didn't know, but I was very afraid. So I decided to build a very strong fence. I cut down young trees and put them in the ground, in a half-circle around the front of my tent. I used many of the ship's ropes too, and in the end my fence was as strong as stone wall. Nobody could get over it, through it, or round it.
Making tents and building fences is hard work. I needed many tools for it. So I decided to go back to the ship again, and get some more things.
I went back twelve times, but soon after my twelfth visit there was another terrible storm. The next morning, when I looked out to sea, there was no ship.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1355,"I still needed a lot of things.
'Well,' I said, 'I'm going to have to make them.'
So, every day, I worked. First of all, I wanted to make my cave bigger. I carried out stone from the cave, and after many days' hard work I had a large cave in the side of the hill. Then I needed a table and a chair, and that was my next job. I had to work on them for a long time. I also wanted to make laces to put all my food, and all my tools and guns. But every time I wanted a piece of wood, I had to cut down a tree. It was long, slow, difficult work, and during the next months I learnt to be very clever with my tools. There was no hurry. I had all the time in the world. I also went out every day, and I always had my gun with me. Sometimes I killed a wild animal, and then I had meat to eat.",robinson crusoe,2,Intermediate,2
1356,"I was on the island for ten months before I visited other parts of it. During those months I worked hard on my cave and my house and my fence. Now I was ready to find out more about the rest of the island.
First, I walked along the side of a little river. There, I found open ground without trees. Later, I came to more trees with many different fruits. That night I went to sleep in a tree for the second time, and the next day I went on with my journey. Soon I came to an opening in the hills. In front of me, everything was green, and there were flowers everywhere.
There were also a lot of different birds and animals. I saw that my house was on the worst side of the island. But I didn't want to move from there. I stayed away for three days, and then I came home.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1357,"And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. The roof of my cave fell in, and nearly killed me! I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.
I had a lot of food now. I cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun. So I always had meat during the rainy months when I could not go out with a gun.
I learnt to make pots to keep my food in. I wanted very much to make a harder, stronger pot - a pot that would not break in a fire. I tried many times, but I could not do it.
Then one day I was lucky. I made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire.
They changed colour, but did not break.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1358,"By then, I also had my own bread. That was luck, too. One day I found a little bag. We used it on the ship, to keep the chickens' food in. There was still some of the food in the bag, and I dropped some of it onto the ground.
A month later, I saw something bright green. And after six months I had a very small field of corn. I was very happy and excited. Perhaps now I could make my own bread!
It was easy to say, but not so easy to do. It is a lot of work to make bread from corn. Many people eat and enjoy bread, but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help? I had to learn and to make many new things, and it was a year before I cooked and ate my first bread.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0
1359,"During all this time I never stopped thinking about escape. When I travelled across to the other side of the island, I could see the other islands, and I said to myself, 'Perhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day.'
So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree, and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work, but about six months later, I had a very fine canoe.
Next, I had to get it down to the sea. How stupid I was! Why didn't I think before I began work? Of course, the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it! I pulled and pushed and tried everything, but it didn't move. I was very unhappy for a long time after that. That happened in my fourth year on the island.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1360,"In my sixth year I made myself a smaller canoe, but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey, and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now, not my prison, and I was just happy to be alive. A year or two later, I made myself a second canoe on the other side of the island. I also built myself a second house there, and so I had two homes.
My life was still busy from morning to night. There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. I kept food and tools at both my houses, and also wild goats. There were many goats on the island, and I made fields with high fences to keep them in. They learnt to take food from me, and soon I had goat's milk to drink every day.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1361,"Then, one year, something strange and terrible happened.
I often walked along the shore, and one day I saw something in the sand. I went over to look at it more carefully, and stopped in a sudden surprise.
It was a footprint - the footprint of a man! Afraid, I looked around me. I listened. I waited. Nothing. I was more and more afraid. Perhaps this man was one of those wild people who killed and ate the men! I looked everywhere, but there was nobody, and no other footprint. I turned and hurried home.
'There's someone on my island,' I said to myself.
That night I couldn't sleep. The next day I got all my guns ready and I put more wood and young trees around my house. Nobody could see me now. But, after fifteen years on the island, I was afraid, and I did not leave my cave for three days.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1362,"In the end, I had to go out to milk my goats. But for two years I was afraid. I stayed near my home and I never used my guns because I didn't want to make a noise. I could not forget the footprint, but I saw and heard nothing more, and slowly I began to feel happier.
One day, a year later, I was over on the west side of the island. From there I could see the other islands, and I could also see a boat, far out to sea. 'If you have a boat,' I thought, 'it's easy to sail across to this island. Perhaps that explains the footprint - it was a visitor from one of the other islands.'
I began to move more freely around the island again, and built myself a third house. It was a very secret place in a cave.
'No wild man will ever find that,' I said to myself.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1363,"For two years I never went anywhere without my gun. I felt lonely and afraid, and had many sleepless nights.
One night there was a very bad storm, and I thought I heard the sound of guns out at sea.
The next morning I looked out, and saw a ship. It was lying on its side not far from the shore. Quickly, I put my little boat in the water and sailed out to it.
There were two dead men on the ship, but no one alive. The bodies of the other sailors were lost in the sea.
In the morning I woke up and made a plan. 'I'll try to catch one of the prisoners of the wild men,' I said to myself.
He'll be happy to be alive and perhaps he'll help me to escape.'
I watched day and night, but for a year and a half there were no boats.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1364,"Then one day five boats came. There were about thirty men and they had two prisoners. They made their fire on sand and danced round it. Then they killed one of the prisoners and began to cook their terrible meal. The second prisoner waited under the trees. Suddenly, the prisoner turned and ran. The two men ran after him, but the other wild men were busy around the fire and did not see what was happening.
The prisoner ran like a wild goat, and soon I saw that he was coming near the bottom of my hill. As fast as I could, I ran down the hill and jumped out of the trees between the prisoner and the two wild men. I hit the first man with the wooden end of my gun and he fell down, but I had to shoot the second man. The poor prisoner did not move. He was afraid of the noise of my gun.",robinson crusoe,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1365,"I called to him and tried to show him that I was friendly. Slowly, he moved nearer to me, but just then the first wild man began to get up from the ground. Then the prisoner spoke and I understood that he wanted my sword. How happy I was to hear words again! I gave him my sword, and at once he cut off the head of his enemy. Hurriedly, we hid the dead bodies under some leaves, and then left quickly. I took my prisoner to my secret cave on the other side of the island and gave him food and drink. After that, he went to sleep.
He was a fine young man, about twenty-five years old, well-built, with a kind face and a nice smile. He had brown skin, black hair, bright eyes and strong white teeth. I decided to give him the name of 'Man Friday', because I first saw him on a Friday.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1366,"When we got to my house, 1 gave Man Friday some trousers, and I made him a coat and a hat. He liked his new clothes very much. Then I made him a little tent to sleep in, but for a few weeks I always took my gun to bed with me. Perhaps Friday was still a wild man and would try to kill me in the night. At first, Friday was very afraid of my gun. Sometimes he talked to it, and asked it not to kill him.
Friday was a quick learner and his English got better day by day. He helped me with the goats and with the work in the cornfields, and soon we were good friends. I enjoyed teaching him and, most of all, having a friend to talk to. This was the happiest of all my years on the island. Friday and I lived together happily for three years.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1367,"I told Friday the story of my adventures and about life in England, and he told me about his country and his people. One day we were at the top of the highest hill on the island, and we were looking out to sea. It was a very clear day and we could see a long way. Suddenly, Friday began to jump up and down, very excited.
'What's the matter?' I said.
'Look, Master, look!' Friday cried. 'I can see my country. Look over there!'
I looked, and there to the north-west, between the sea and the sky, was a long thin piece of land. I learnt later that it was the island of Trinidad, and that my island was in the mouth of the River Orinoco on the north coast of South America.
I began to think again about escape. Perhaps Friday wanted to go home too. Perhaps together we could get to his country.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1368,"I took Friday to the other side of the island and showed him my big canoe. It still lay under the trees. It was very old now, and there were holes in the wood.
'Could a boat like this sail to your country, Friday?' I asked him.
'Oh yes,' he answered. 'A boat like this can carry a lot of food and drink.'
'Then we'll make another canoe like it, and you can go home in it,' I said.
But Friday looked very unhappy.
'Why are you angry with me?' he asked. 'What have I done? Why do you want to send me home?'
'But I thought you wanted to go home,' I said.
'Yes. But you must come with me.'
Then I saw that Friday was a true friend, and so I agreed to go with him. We began work on the canoe at once. We worked hard and in a month the boat was finished.",robinson crusoe,2,Beginner,0
1369,"I was now in my twenty-seventh year on the island, and I did not want to be there for another year. We worked hard to get the corn in, and to make a lot of bread. We had dried fruit and salted meat, and big pots to keep water in. One evening Friday went out to look for a turtle for meat and eggs. But in less than an hour he was back, and he looked very afraid.
'Master! Master!' he cried. 'There's a great ship near the island, and men are coming to the shore in a boat!'
I jumped up and ran with him down to the shore. To my great surprise, I saw that it was an English ship! But why was it here? English ships never came this way. Perhaps they were pirates!
'Don't let them see you, Friday!' I called. 'We'll hide in the trees and watch.'",robinson crusoe,2,Intermediate,2
1370,"When I came back to England, I felt like a stranger in the country. Many things were different, and not many people remembered me. I went home to Yark, but my father and mother were dead, and also my two brothers. I did find the two sons of one of my brothers. They were happy to learn that I was alive, and I was pleased to find some family.
After some months I decided to go down to Lisbon in Portugal. I had friends there who could help me to sell my land in Brazil, and I needed the money. Friday came with me. He was always a good and true friend to me.
In Lisbon I found the Portuguese captain, who took me in his ship to Brazil, all those years ago. It was good to see him again, and he helped me with my business. Soon I was ready to go home again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1371,"It was a long hard fight, but by now it was dark and this helped us very much. We ran here and there in the trees, calling and shouting. The seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting.
In the end the first officer shouted to them: 'Put down your guns and stop fighting! The captain has fifty island people to help him. We can kill you all!'
So the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns. Three of the men agreed to come back to the captain, and we put the others in my cave. Friday and I stayed to watch the prisoners, while the captain and his men went back to fight for the ship. All night we listened to the sound of guns and shouting, but in the morning, when the sun came up, the captain was master of his ship again.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1372,"Friday and I went down to the shore to meet the captain.
'My dear friend,' he cried. 'There's your ship! I'll take you to the end of the world in it!'
I put my arms round him, and we laughed and cried together. How happy I was to leave the island!
My good friend Friday came with me, of course, but we left the mutineers on the island. We decided not to kill them; they could begin a new life on the island. I showed them my three houses, my cornfields and my goats, and all my tools. Their life would be easy because of all my hard work for so many years.
And so, on the nineteenth of December 1686 - after twenty-seven years, two months and nineteen days - I said goodbye to my island and sailed home to England.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1373,"Our journey back to England was long and hard. We had to cross the mountains between Spain and France in winter, and the snow was deep. Poor Friday was very afraid of the snow.
In his country it was always hot, and he did not like cold weather.
Back in England I found a house and began to live a quiet life. My two nephews came to live with me. The younger one wanted to be a sailor, and so I found him a place on a ship. After a while I married, and had three children, two sons and a daughter. Then my wife died, and my nephew, who was now the captain of a ship, came home to see me. He knew that I did not really like a quiet life.
'I have a fine ship, uncle,' he said. 'I'm going out to the East Indies. Why don't you come with me?'
So, in 1694, I went to sea, and had many more adventures.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1374,"There were eleven men in the boat, but three of them were prisoners. Their arms were tied with rope, but their legs were free and they could walk. The other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach, laughing and shouting and hitting them. Then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink. Others walked away to look at the island, and two men stayed to watch the boat. The three prisoners walked slowly along the beach and sat down under a tree, not far from us. They looked very unhappy.
Very quietly, I came up behind them through the trees, and called out to them in English.
'Don't be afraid,' I said. 'I'm an Englishman. Perhaps I can help you.'
The three men turned and looked at me. They did not answer at once; they were too surprised.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1375,"Perhaps the men thought I was a wild man myself, in my strange homemade clothes, and with my long hair and beard. Then the oldest man spoke.
'I am the captain of that ship,' he said, 'and these two men are my first and second officers. Last night there was a mutiny, and the seamen took the ship from me. Now they're going to leave the three of us here, to die on this island.'
'Do these mutineers have guns?'
'Only two,' he answered, 'and they've left those on the boat.'
'All right,' I said. 'We'll fight them, but if we get your ship back for you, you must take me back to England.'
The captain agreed immediately and thanked me very warmly for my help. Friday ran back to my house to get all the guns, and the captain and I made a plan.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1376,"The first part was easy because the seamen were not ready for a fight. We shot the two men at the boat, and the captain shot another man. This man, Tom Smith, was the worst of them all and he began the mutiny on the ship. Then the captain talked to the other five men, and they agreed to help him. They did not really want to be mutineers, but they were afraid of Tom Smith.
'Now,' I said to the captain, 'we must get back your ship. How many men are on it?'
'Twenty-six,' the captain replied, 'and they will fight hard because they won't want to go home. It is death for all mutineers in England. But I'm sure that some of them will help me.'
Just then we saw another boat, which was coming from the ship. There were ten men in it, and they all had guns. We ran into the trees and waited.",robinson crusoe,2,Intermediate,2

He fought against one king (James II), and later joined the army of another king (William III). He went to prison twice because he wrote clever booklets against the church and the government. He travelled a lot, worked as a spy, started his own newspaper, and has more than 500 pieces of writing to his name - more than any other writer in the English language.

There were different parts of men's bodies everywhere. For a minute, I couldn't think, and then I understood. Sometimes there were fights between the wild men on the other islands.
Slowly, I went home, but I was very angry. How could men do this? For many months I watched carefully for the smoke from fires, but I didn't see anything. Somehow the wild men came and went, and I never saw them. I was angry and afraid. I wanted to shoot them all, but there were many of them and only one of me.

1384,"It was dark now and I was tired. I was afraid to sleep on the shore. Perhaps there were wild animals there. So I went up into a tree and I stayed there all night.

1385,"I got the things that I wanted from the ship. There was a big box of food - rice, and salted meat, and hard ship's bread. I also took many strong knives and other tools - the ship's sails and ropes, paper, pens, books, and seven guns.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

1389,"Every day I worked. First of all, I wanted to make my cave bigger. I carried out stone from the cave, and after many days' hard work I had a large cave in the side of the hill. Then I needed a table and a chair, and that was my next job.",robinson crusoe,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

1400,"Nobody seemed to care about Mary. She was born in India, where her father was a British official. He was busy with his work, and her mother, who was very beautiful, spent all her time going to parties. So an Indian woman, Kamala, was paid to take care of the little girl. Mary was not a pretty child. She had a thin angry face and thin yellow hair. She was always giving orders to Kamala, who had to obey. Mary never thought of other people, but only of herself. In fact, she was a very selfish, disagreeable, bad tempered little girl. One very hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she woke up and saw that instead of Kamala there was a different Indian servant by her bed. 'What are you doing here?' she asked crossly. She was furious.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1401,"Mary had never known her parents well, so she did not miss them at all. She only thought of herself, as she had always done.
'Where will I live?' she wondered. 'I hope I'll stay with people who'll let me do what I want.'
At first she was taken to an English family who had known her parents. She hated their untidy house and noisy children, and preferred playing by herself in the garden.
One day she was playing her favourite game, pretending to make a garden, when one of the children, Basil, offered to help.
'Go away!' cried Mary. 'I don't want your help!'
For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to laugh. He danced round and round Mary, and sang a funny little song about Miss Mary and her stupid flowers. This made Mary very cross indeed. No one had ever laughed at her so unkindly.",the secret garden,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1402,"After the long sea journey, Mary was met in London by Mr Craven's housekeeper, Mrs Medlock. Together they travelled north by train. Mrs Medlock was a large woman, with a very red face and bright black eyes. Mary did not like her, but that was not surprising, because she did not usually like people. Mrs Medlock did not like Mary either.
'What a disagreeable child!' thought the housekeeper. 'But perhaps I should talk to her.'
'I can tell you a bit about your uncle if you like,' she said aloud. 'He lives in a big old house, a long way from anywhere. There are nearly a hundred rooms, but most of them are shut and locked. There's a big park round the house, and all kinds of gardens. Well, what do you think of that?'
'Nothing,' replied Mary. 'It doesn't matter to me.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1403,"Mary stared out of the train window at the grey sky and the rain. She was not looking forward to life at her uncle's house. The train journey lasted all day, and it was dark when they arrived at the station. Then there was a long drive to get to the house. It was a cold, windy night, and it was raining heavily. After a while, Mary began to hear a strange, wild noise. She looked out of the window, but could see nothing except the darkness.
'What's that noise?' she asked Mrs Medlock. 'It's not the sea, is it?'
'No, that's the moor. It's the sound the wind makes, blowing across the moor.'
'What is a moor?'
'It's just miles and miles of wild land, with no trees or houses. Your uncle's house is right on the edge of the moor.'
Mary listened to the strange sound. 'I don't like it,' she thought.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1404,"Mrs Medlock and Mary arrived at a very large old house. It looked dark and unfriendly from the outside. Inside, Mary looked around the big shadowy hall, and felt very small and lost. They went straight upstairs. Mary was shown to a room where there was a warm fire and food on the table.
'This is your room,' said Mrs Medlock. 'Go to bed when you've had some supper. And remember, you must stay in your room! Mr Craven doesn't want you to wander all over the house!'
When Mary woke up the next morning, she saw a young servant girl cleaning the fireplace. The room seemed dark and rather strange, with pictures of dogs and horses and ladies on the walls. It was not a child's room at all. From the window she could not see any trees or houses, only wild land, which looked like a kind of purple sea.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1405,"Martha woke up and stared a young servant.
'You'll have to learn to play by yourself. Dickon plays by himself on the moors for hours, with the wild birds, and the sheep, and the other animals.' She looked away for a moment. 'Perhaps I shouldn't tell you this, but - but one of the walled gardens is locked up. Nobody's been in it for ten years. It was Mrs Craven's garden, and when she died so suddenly, Mr Craven locked it and buried the key - Oh, I must go, I can hear Mrs Medlock's bell ringing for me.'
Mary went downstairs and wandered through the great empty gardens.
'How ugly it all looks in winter!' she thought. 'But what a mystery the locked garden is! Why did my uncle bury the key? If he loved his wife, why did he hate her garden? Perhaps I'll never know.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1406,"In the next few days Mary spent almost all her time in the gardens. The fresh air from the moor made her hungry, and she was becoming stronger and healthier. One day she noticed the robin again. He was on top of a wall, singing to her.
'Good morning! Isn't this fun! Come this way!' he seemed to say, as he hopped along the wall Mary began to laugh as she danced along beside him.
'I know the secret garden's on the other side of this wall!' she thought excitedly. 'And the robin lives there! But where's the door?'
That evening she asked Martha to stay and talk to her beside the fire after supper. They could hear the wind blowing round the old house, but the room was warm and comfortable. Mary only had one idea in her head.
'Tell me about the secret garden,' she said.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1407,"The next day it was very rainy, so Mary did not go out. Instead she decided to wander round the house, looking into some of the hundred rooms that Mrs Medlock had told her about. She spent all morning going in and out of dark, silent rooms, which were full of heavy furniture and old pictures. She saw no servants at all, and was on her way back to her room for lunch, when she heard a cry.
'It's a bit like the cry that I heard last night!' she thought. Just then the housekeeper, Mrs Medlock, appeared, with her keys in her hand.
'You didn't hear anything! Go back to your room now. And if you don't stay there, I'll lock you in!'
Mary hated Mrs Medlock for this.
There was someone crying, I know there was!' she said to herself. 'But I'll discover who it is soon!'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1408,"Mary felt lonelier than ever when Martha had gone, so she went outside. The sunshine made the gardens look different. And the change in the weather had even made Ben Weatherstaff, the gardener, easier to talk to.
'Can you smell spring in the air?' he asked her. 'Things are growing, deep down in the ground. Soon you'll see little green shoots coming up - young plants, they are. You watch them.'
'I will,' replied Mary. 'Oh, there's the robin!' The little bird hopped on to Ben's spade, 'Are things growing in the garden where he lives?'
'What garden?' said Ben, in his bad-tempered voice.
'You know, the secret garden. Are the flowers dead there?' She really wanted to know the answer.
'Ask the robin,' said Ben crossly. 'He's the only one who's been in there for the last ten years.'",the secret garden,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1409,"Mary was walking beside the long wall of the secret garden, when the most wonderful thing happened. She suddenly realized the robin was following her. She felt very pleased and excited by this, and cried out, 'You like me, don't you? And I like you too!'
As he hopped along beside her, she hopped and sang too, to show him that she was his friend. Just then he stopped at a place where a dog had dug a hole in the ground. As Mary looked at the hole, she noticed something almost buried there. She put her hand in and pulled it out. It was an old key.
'Perhaps it's been buried for ten years,' she whispered to herself. 'Perhaps it's the key to the secret garden!'
She looked at it for a long time. How lovely it would be to find the garden, and see what had happened to it in the last ten years!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1410,"Mary skipped all the way to the secret garden wall. And there was the robin! He had followed her!
'You showed me where the key was yesterday,' she laughed. 'I've got it in my pocket. So you ought to show me the door today!'
The robin hopped on to an old climbing plant on the wall, and sang his most beautiful song. Suddenly the wind made the plant move, and Mary saw something under the dark green leaves. The thick, heavy plant was covering a door. Mary's heart was beating fast and her hands were shaking as she pushed the leaves away and found the keyhole. She took the key out of her pocket, and it fitted the hole. Using both hands, she managed to unlock the door. She pushed the door, which opened, slowly, for the first time in ten years. At last she was inside the secret garden!",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1411,"Mary almost forgot about lunch, and when she arrived back in her room, she was very hungry and ate twice as much as usual.
'Martha,' she said as she was eating, 'I've been thinking. This is a big, lonely house, and there isn't much for me to do. Do you think, if I buy a little spade, I can make my own garden?'
'That's just what Mother said,' replied Martha. 'You'd enjoy digging and watching plants growing. Dickon can get you a spade, and some seeds to plant if you like.'
'Oh, thank you, Martha! I've got some money that Mrs Medlock gave me. Will you write and ask Dickon to buy a spade and some seeds for me?'
'I will. And he'll bring them to you himself.'
'Oh! Then I'll see him.' Mary looked very excited.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1412,"In the middle of the night Mary woke up. Suddenly she heard crying again. This time she decided to discover who it was. She left her room, and in the darkness followed the crying sound, round corners and through doors, up and down stairs, to the other side of the big house. At last she found the right room. She pushed the door open and went in. It was a big room with beautiful old furniture and pictures. In the large bed was a boy, who looked tired and cross, with a thin, white, tearful face. He stared at Mary.
'Who are you?' he whispered. 'Are you a dream?'
'No, I'm not. I'm Mary Lennox. Mr Craven's my uncle.'
'He's my father,' said the boy. 'I'm Colin Craven.'
'No one ever told me he had a son!' said Mary, very surprised.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1413,"The next afternoon Mary visited Colin again, and he seemed very pleased to see her. He had sent his nurse away and had told nobody about Mary's visit. Mary had not told anybody either. They read some of his books together, and told each other stories. They were enjoying themselves and laughing loudly when suddenly the door opened. Dr Craven and Mrs Medlock came in. They almost fell over in surprise.
'What's happening here?' asked Dr Craven.
Colin sat up straight. To Mary he looked just like an Indian prince.
'This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,' he said calmly. 'I like her. She must visit me often.'
'Oh, I'm sorry, sir,' said poor Mrs Medlock to the doctor. 'I don't know how she discovered him. I told the servants to keep it a secret.'",the secret garden,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1414,"Mary and Dickon had a lot of gardening and planning to do and Mary did not have time to visit Colin that day. When she came back to the house in the evening, Martha told her that the servants had had trouble with Colin.
'He's been very bad-tempered all afternoon with all of us, because you didn't come, miss,'
'Well, I was busy. He'll have to learn not to be so selfish,' replied Mary coldly. She forgot how selfish she had been when she was ill in India. 'I'll go and see him now.'
When she went into his room, he was lying in bed, looking tired. He did not turn to look at her.
'What's the matter with you?' she asked crossly.
'My back aches and my head hurts. Why didn't you come this afternoon?'
'I was working in the garden with Dickon.'
Colin was angry.",the secret garden,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1415,"It was very important that no one should see Colin, Mary, or Dickon entering the secret garden. So Colin gave orders to the gardeners that they must all keep away from that part of the garden in future. The next afternoon Colin was carried downstairs by a man servant, and put in his wheelchair outside the front door. Dickon arrived, with his crow, two squirrels and the fox, and started pushing the wheelchair gently away from the house, and into the gardens. Spring had really arrived now and it seemed very exciting to Colin, who had lived indoors for so long. He smelt the warm air from the moor, and watched the little white clouds in the blue sky. In a very short time he heard Mary say, 'This is where I found the key. And this is the door and this, this is the secret garden!'",the secret garden,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1416,"Colin covered his eyes with his hands until he was inside the four high walls, and the door was shut again. Then he looked round at the roses climbing the old red walls, the pink and white flowers on the fruit trees, and the birds and the butterflies everywhere. The sun warmed his face, and he suddenly knew he felt different.
'Mary! Dickon!' he cried. 'I'm going to get better! I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!'
As Dickon pushed the wheelchair all round the garden, he told Colin the names of all the plants. The sun shone, the birds sang, and in every corner of the garden there was something interesting to look at. The three children talked and laughed, and by the end of the afternoon all three were speaking Yorkshire together.",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1417,"That morning Mr Craven received a letter from Susan Sowerby. In it she asked him to come home, but she did not give a reason. Mr Craven thought of his dream, and decided to return to England immediately. On the long journey back to Yorkshire, he was thinking about Colin.
'I wonder how he is! I wanted to forget him, because he makes me think of his mother. He lived, and she died! But perhaps I've been wrong.'
When he arrived home, he found the housekeeper very confused about Colin's health.
'He's very strange, sir,' said Mrs Medlock. 'He used to scream even at the idea of fresh air, but now he spends all his time outside in his wheelchair, with Miss Mary and Dickon Sowerby. He's in the garden at the moment.'",the secret garden,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1418,"In the secret garden, where the roses were at their best, and the butterflies were flying from flower to flower, they told Colin's father their story.
Sometimes Mr Craven laughed and sometimes he cried, but most of the time he just looked, unbelieving, into the handsome face of the son that he had almost forgotten.
'Now,' said Colin at the end, 'it isn't a secret anymore. I'll never use the wheelchair again. I'm going to walk back with you, Father - to the house.'
And so, that afternoon, Mrs Medlock, Martha, and the other servants had the greatest shock of their lives. Through the gardens towards the house came Mr Craven, looking happier than they had ever seen him. And by his side, with his shoulders straight, his head held high and a smile on his lips, walked young Colin!",the secret garden,3,Advanced,4

'Spring will be here soon,' said Martha happily. 'You'll love the moor then, when it's full of flowers and birds.'
'Could I get to the moor?' asked Mary.
'You've never done much walking, have you? I don't think you could walk the five miles to our cottage!'
'But I'd like to meet your family,' Mary said.
Martha looked at the little girl for a moment. She remembered how disagreeable Mary had been when she first arrived. But now, Mary looked interested and friendly.

He wanted three months in a nice, warm prison, with food and good friends. This was how he usually spent his winters. And now it was time, because, at night on his seat in the square, three newspapers did not keep out the cold. So the man decided to go to prison, and at once began to try his first plan. It was usually easy. He ate dinner in an expensive restaurant. Then he told them he had no money and they called a policeman. Nice and easy, with no trouble. So he walked slowly along the street.

'I'll soon be in prison now,' he thought. The policeman came up to Tom.
'Who did that?' he asked.
'Perhaps I did,' Soapy replied. But the policeman knew that people who break windows do not stop to talk to policemen. They run away. And just then the policeman saw another man, who was running to catch a bus. So the policeman ran after him.",short stories,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'That's my umbrella,' he said.
'Oh, is it?' Tom replied. 'Then why don't you call a policeman? I took it, and you say it's your umbrella. Go on, then. Call a policeman! Look! There's one on the corner.'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1481,"Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, orshe fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. She tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1482,"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1483,"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1484,"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked ""poison"" or not'.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1485,"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast) she very soon finished it off.
'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1486,"She decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself. Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key.'",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1487,"Now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).
'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; — but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
'They must go by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1488,"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'
And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all. Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and — oh dear, how puzzling it all is!",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1489,"Alice looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
'How can I have done that?' she thought. ' I must be growing small again.'
She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
That was a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but the little door was shut again, and the golden key was lying on the glass table.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1490,"In another moment, Alice was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case, I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.
(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. ' I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!'",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4
1491,"Alice heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?'
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying. So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'.
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1492,"Perhaps the mouse doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.'
So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. ' I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'
'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'
'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing.'",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1493,"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!', Alice cried to the mouse.
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
1494,"I wish I hadn't mentioned my cat!' Alice said to herself in a melancholy tone. 'Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!",alice in wonderland,2,Advanced,4
1495,"Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!'
And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan and gloves — that is, if I can find them.'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

There was no label this time with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.
'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
1497,"I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.
'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.'",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'Who are YOU' said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I — I hardly know, sir, just at present — at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'
'What do you mean by that' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!'
'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.'
'And I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2

'What size do you want to be?' it asked.
'Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied; 'only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'
'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
'Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.
'Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,' said Alice: 'three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
'It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). 'But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

'One side of WHAT The other side of WHAT' thought Alice to herself.
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
'And now which is which' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit.'",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
'Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2

At last she decided to pick up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2
1504,"What a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if — if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let me see — how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and she decided to bite it.",alice in wonderland,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here'
'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.
'I don't much care where — ' said Alice.
'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.
' — so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.
'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long enough.'
'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like they're both mad.'",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2

'I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. 'Let me alone!'
'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
'I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said Alice.
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; 'but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

'I — I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.
'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.
'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'
'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'
'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'
'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",alice in wonderland,2,Intermediate,2

She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said 'That's very curious.'
'It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. 'I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.",alice in wonderland,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them — 'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!'

1570,"The Pareto principle (also known as the ""80-20 rule"") says that for many things, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. The original observation was in connection with income and wealth. Vilfred Pareto, a French-Italian philosopher (1848-1923) noticed that 80% of Italy's wealth was owned by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found that a similar distribution applied. These days, the Pareto principle can be applied to a number of different scenarios. In business, directors often use the Pareto principle to analyse the company. For example, they may find that 80% of the sales come from 20% of their clients; or that 20% of the workforce creates 80% of the company's wealth.",different stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

The alpine nation really is highly efficient. And meticulously punctual. Clean, too. For chronically tardy, resolutely inefficient (not to mention slovenly) people like myself, a visit to Switzerland yields a cocktail of emotions: awe, relief and a dash of irritation.
For the Swiss, punctuality is not merely a nicety, a bonbon in the buffet of life. It is a source of deep contentment.

If someone says they will meet me at 2 pm, they arrive at 2 pm not 2:05 (or 1:55, for that matter). I like this. For a while.
Then it annoys me. The extreme punctuality strikes me as a kind of stinginess.
That is unfair though, and finally, invariably, I come to appreciate Swiss punctuality for what it is: a deep expression of respect for other people. A punctual person is a considerate one. By showing up on time – for everything – a Swiss person is saying, in effect, ""I value your time and, by extension, I value you.""",traveling part 1,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

Susan Jane Gilman, an American author who has lived in Geneva for the past 11 years, recounted with awe how she's ""never had a taxi that arrived late, that wasn't there exactly when it said it would be"". She marvelled at how, for instance, when she's ordered a new refrigerator, the company gives her a precise two-hour window for delivery – and sticks to it.

For one thing, it creates a kind of bunching effect. Coffee shops in Swiss cities tend to be crowded at 4 p.m. every day because everybody takes their coffee break at exactly 4 p.m. In apartment buildings, residents must abide by a strict weekday schedule for use of the laundry room.

A California cowboy to his core, Loverin has had a horse and mule packing business in Kings Canyon National Park for more than 30 years. His team of livestock carries visitors – and their hundreds of pounds of camping and fishing gear – through the southern Sierra Nevada backcountry. The former commercial wood cutter, now 66, is part of a Wild West legacy of packers and pioneers: his great grandfather was the first civilian ranger in the adjacent Sequoia National Park, and his grandfather – who took him on his first packing trip in 1958 – was a commercial packer in the early 1900s.",traveling part 1,4,Advanced,4

Kings Canyon's landscape is filled with jagged glacier-cut peaks that jut higher than 4,200 m into the sky – not to mention waterfalls, alpine lakes and a canyon that carves deeper than any other in the US, including the Grand Canyon.

Together, they founded the Cave Research Foundation, a team of volunteers dedicated to scientific exploration. Their hope was to connect the local caves into a single giant system.
Up until then, mapping had been a disjointed and secretive process. In the 1840s, a slave and cave guide named Stephen Bishop published a sketch of Mammoth's known tunnels. But modern explorers were less forthcoming. The available maps ranged from detailed illustrations to vague line diagrams. The Cave Research Foundation needed a sense of the whole.
Brucker decided to combine the tunnel surveys with a topographic map of the land above to find out the length of the cave.",traveling part 1,4,Advanced,4

Not least of all because macho men can't squeeze through narrow passageways. Size is often a deciding factor in caving: even the park's Wild Cave Tour is limited to people measuring 42 inches or less at the shoulders and hips.
Outsized enthusiasts can still read their way through the cave. Brucker has co-authored four books on the exploration of Mammoth and published a historical novel about Stephen Bishop, the slave whose map was among the first published.

There are rumours that Prague officials are going to close the legendary sausage stands that dot the long Parisian-like boulevard they call a ""square"".

The kielbasa, which originated in Poland, is the most common – it's long and thick, and is usually grilled like the kind I'd eaten at Wenceslas Square.
The following day, I met up with two acquaintances. When I mentioned that I had planned to explore the sausage side of the city, they had a warning for me.

But the ocean is quickly eroding the coast: up to a metre of coastline disappears every year. According to geologists, without intervention the 15-metre-high tower would have tumbled over the cliff later this year. It was an emergency that prompted an unusual rescue mission: the building had to be dragged from danger.
To move it to a new location, hydraulic hoists were used, as well as more old-fashioned rollers and splints.

I was more excited about delving into this bizarre community I'd heard so much about.
As the tiny settlement came closer, we hailed the island over the VHF radio to announce our arrival. Within minutes, a scuffed aluminium boat was speeding toward us from inside the protected lagoon.

But what makes this tiny Cook Islands outlier more than just a pretty place are the quirks that footnote its culture: the island has the highest number of freezers per capita in the Southern Hemisphere; locals play volleyball every afternoon except Sunday.

From Australia's bubblegum-pink lake and a blood-red waterfall in Antarctica to a secret beach-in-a-hole in Mexico and a US valley where stones eerily move, these seven spots are Mother Nature's eyeball-popping sideshow.

It's a stunning, but potentially dangerous sight. This potent greenhouse gas not only warms the planet, but also is highly flammable.

For example, the Tabernas Desert is the driest region in Europe. In fact, it's so convincing that many of the spaghetti western films were shot there.

""Kids tend to report that seeing the wildlife is the highlight of their trip,"" Williams said.

As the heat of the lights melted the mixture, the audience thought Syd's face was melting. Eventually Syd was replaced by David Gilmour and faded into obscurity. He died in 2006. As the 1970s progressed, so did the music. ""Dark side of the Moon"" and ""The Wall"" are two of the biggest-selling albums in history.

So, Elvis's management agency thought it would be a good idea to send him away to the army. They wanted him to appear like an ordinary person, but the stunt had the opposite effect and actually helped promote Elvis even more. As a result, Elvis's career really took off.

In fact, Bowie had to wait for his first hit record, Space Oddity, which he released in 1969. But even then, his next two albums weren't very popular, although Hunky Dory (1971) is now thought of as a classic. But everything changed in 1972.

Before technology and the internet, even the most popular musicians earnings depended on the number of people who could hear them perform live. These days, the celebrities can reach a much wider audience, and therefore earn much more money from doing the same amount of work. Vanessa Mae is a typical example. She is the world's most popular violinist, and she has a global fan base. ""The exposure that you get around the world is only thanks to technology,"" she says.

However, more and more cities are cracking down on them. Camden (an area in northern London) is one such example. Street musicians now need to pay an annual licence fee, and there are fines of up to £1,000 for not complying with the law.

Radio and the recording industry introduced non-Western cultures to these new forms of popular music.

Soon it adopted music from funeral processions and popular dance music. Chicago and New York City emerged as major jazz centers.

Classical music is a very formal kind of music. This makes classical different from forms such as jazz or folk music. Classical music has set fairly complex patterns that all classical composers (writers of music) and musicians understand and follow. A sonata is made up of three parts that focus, in different ways, on a main musical theme, or special tune. The first part presents the theme. In the second part the theme is developed and played in different ways. The third part repeats the theme. A symphony is a longer composition created to be played by an orchestra.

So to test him, they asked young Mozart to stay in a room alone for a week. At the end of the week, Mozart had written a new piece of choir music. Mozart often blended popular and classical music to create new styles of music. Mozart could hear a piece once and then play it from memory, sometimes rewriting and improving it as he played.

They could do anything, and I believe they would have done everything if they hadn't been cut short by John Bonham's death. Zeppelin served as a great escape from a lot of things.

1894,"Folk music is the shared music of a group or community of people. It's everyday music that was often created as part of children's games or as a way to make work easier. Some songs were sung at parties or weddings. Some were used to celebrate births. And some were used as part of religious services. Folk music is learned and passed on by everyone, not just musicians. Many folk performers haven't studied music in school, but they learned songs by listening to others play and sing. Because it usually isn't written down, folk music changes as it travels between people and countries. Songs are created or lost, and some change because of people's poor memory. Other songs are rewritten to match new times, situations, and ideas",art,3,Intermediate,2
1895,"Thousands of years ago, early human beings lived in caves or other natural formations. As time passed, people learned new skills, developed new tools, and were able to build simple shelters. As societies developed, they needed more kinds of buildings. Soon forts, barns, schools, bridges, tombs, and temples were being built, using a variety of materials. Gradually, creating buildings became an activity for experts—an art and occupation that came to be known as ""architecture."" Today architecture is a refined art requiring a lot of training, years of practice, and plenty of talent. An architect's work is to imagine and plan a building and then to supervise its construction. Architects also try to create buildings that people like to look at as well as to live, work, and play in.",art,3,Advanced,4
1896,"Sculpture is a three-dimensional visual art. Paintings, drawings, and photographs are all two-dimensional, or flat. Sculpture, like other arts, is often made to express thoughts or feelings. People who look at it might respond with thoughts or feelings of their own. Some sculptures are realistic. Until the middle of the 20th century, most sculpture was meant to look like some person or thing. Some modern sculptures may be abstract. This means they only hint at an object or an idea. Sculptures come in all sizes, shapes, textures, and materials. Sculptors may use soft materials such as clay, wax, or wood or harder materials such as stone or metal. Sometimes the materials aren't even meant to last. One artist makes sculptures out of milk!",art,3,Intermediate,2

Today when people gather at social events, they still dance. Dancing is one of the oldest and most popular of forms of human expression. Originally, there were two kinds of dances. Social dances were performed on special occasions, such as births or marriages. Religious dances were performed to ask the gods for help, such as to provide rain or cure the sick. Over the years, many early forms became folk dances. These continue to be enjoyed to traditional music. Some dances, however, became the specialty of professional artists. This kind of dance tends to be more theatrical and creative.",art,3,Intermediate,2

It's valuable work that people make sure is heard, read, and passed down from generation to generation. People usually think of literature as novels such as Tom Sawyer, the poetry of Emily Dickinson, or the plays of William Shakespeare. But even books for young readers, such as The Cat in the Hat or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, can be literature. Literature also includes philosophy and history, letters and essays, even journals like The Diary of Anne Frank.

Altogether, the making and overall experience of a dramatic performance is called ""theater."" At first, theater was part of religious celebrations. Until several hundred years ago, most people couldn't read. Seeing the religious stories acted out helped them better understand their religion. Theater gradually developed into an art, and plays were written and performed for entertainment and to communicate ideas. As the art of theater grew, a whole group of professional artists grew around it. Today the theater employs a great many creative people doing different jobs to make and run a play.",art,3,Intermediate,2
1900,"The playwright is the person who writes the play's words and basic actions. That written product is called a ""script."" The play's director reads the script and thinks of a way to turn the script's words and actions into a live performance. The actors and actresses learn the lines of the script and pretend to be the characters in the story. The designers make up another important group of theater artists. These behind-the-scenes people invent and build the environment of the play: the actors' costumes and makeup, the special lighting, any sound or music that's needed, props or properties used in the play, and the set or scenery the play is performed on. All these people and elements build a fascinating dramatic world.",art,3,Intermediate,2

But soon movies were being projected onto a large screen for large audiences. The earliest movies were silent. Words appeared on the screen between scenes to give dialogue or to help explain the action. The first feature film was The Great Train Robbery, a 10-minute action movie made in 1903. Audiences were thrilled with this story of the holdup of a moving train. Some people even fainted during the final scene when an actor turned and fired his gun at the camera. In 1927 The Jazz Singer marked the beginning of sound in cinema. The first ""talkies"" were hard to understand.

Directors of this sort include Alfred Hitchcock, Satyajit Ray, Ingmar Bergman, and Federico Fellini. Today India and Hong Kong have large film industries. And countries such as Iran, Mexico, France, Spain, and Japan produce especially beautiful, interesting films. In the late 20th century both Australia and Ireland became known for their sensitive and witty films.

1903,"Like a play, an opera is a story acted out onstage. In an opera the actors sing their lines instead of speaking them. But an opera is different from a musical. Unlike in a musical, opera performers usually don't speak at all. The music an orchestra plays for an opera is as important to the overall effect as the singing. Traditional opera tells a big story in a grand way. The story is usually serious, though there are comic operas too. Many operas tell tragic tales of lovers who are kept apart. Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde is one of these. Some operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Magic Flute, tell a story of mystery and enchantment. Comic operas, such as Giaocchino Rossetti's The Barber of Seville, often feature silly situations and people.",art,3,Intermediate,2

Called ""Art Eggsident,"" (like ""art accident"") many of the eggs were over 30 metres wide. The egg art was popular with kids, who enjoyed climbing up the 2.3 metre tall sculptures. The enormous eggs had bloggers talking too. One person said, ""I love it, but it does need bacon. And toast. And coffee."" Another blogger said she hoped Google Earth would pick up the eggs on satellite. Hofstra hoped so too. The super-sized eggs were his second attempt at a sculpture big enough to show up from space on Google Earth satellites.",art,3,Intermediate,2
1905,"The ancient Romans were keen graffitists. And we've learned much about them from their carvings on walls and monuments. But graffiti is even older than the Romans. It actually dates back to 30,000 BC – making it one of the oldest forms of artistic expression. The earliest examples are cave paintings and pictographs and were probably made using animal bones and pigment. But things have changed since then. Bones and pigment have been replaced by the spray-can. Many people consider the US (and New York in particular) to be the spiritual home of modern graffiti. There was an explosion of street art in the city in the 1970s, especially in subway stations and on the sides of underground trains. And it wasn't simply people scrawling their names – some were complex and powerful works of art.",art,3,Advanced,4

He's from England and operates mainly in Bristol and London, but his fame is global, and his works can be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to Palestine. Indeed, Banksy is now so popular that Cristina Aguilera and Angelina Jolie are both rumoured to have bought his works. Banksy's works are often satirical and deal with politics, culture and ethics. One Nation Under CCTV was a comment on Britain's ""Big Brother"" society. It appeared on the exterior wall of a building in London, and consists of a small boy painting the words ""One Nation Under CCTV"" in giant letters. The work became a landmark in London, attracting visitors from around the world. Ironically, Banksy managed to put it up whilst being watched by real CCTV cameras!",art,3,Advanced,4
1907,"A painting is a two-dimensional, or flat, work of visual art. It is created by applying some form of color or paint to a surface. Some artists paint what they see around them. Others paint pictures that they see in their imagination. The idea on which a painting is based is called its ""theme."" Painters use many materials in their works. These include oil paints, acrylics, watercolors, pastels, inks, dyes, and enamel paints. Painters use different tools to apply these colors, like brushes of various sizes and flexible tools called ""palette knives."" You probably know that many paintings are made on canvas or paper. But paintings can also be applied to different surfaces. Murals are paintings on walls, both indoors and outdoors. Frescoes are wall paintings made on wet plaster.",art,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1908,"Most of us have been to museums that display art by famous painters and sculptors. But another sort of artwork is common to almost every culture—the arts and crafts of nonfamous but skilled people who carry on the traditions of their ancestors.
Folk art has its name because it's made by the ""folk,"" or common people, rather than by professional artists. Farmers, shepherds, fisherfolk, and tradespeople who live away from cities are often the creators of folk art. Some are very skilled. European sailors used to carve beautiful scrimshaw, or delicately engraved pieces of whalebone or ivory. Today people in India, Ghana, Indonesia, and other places make beautiful fabrics in patterns unique to their regions.",art,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
1909,"Until recently, all music had to be sung or played in person. In the 18th century, people began to find ways to play music automatically. They created musical clocks, player pianos, and music boxes. With the help of water power, clockwork, and steam, these instruments made music without needing people to play them.
In the late 1800s, the earliest recording devices were invented. These allowed people to make copies of musical performances.
After the mid-20th century, inventors began to create electronic versions of some older instruments. They also built electronic instruments that made music in whole new ways. These instruments were called ""synthesizers"" because they artificially made, or synthesized, music.",art,3,Advanced,4

Speeches like Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream can also be literature. But just writing something down doesn't make it literature. We don't usually think of useful but such disposable things as phone books, menus, or game instructions as literature. Even books come and go—many that you see in stores today won't be around decades from now. On the other hand, most newspaper articles are read once and tossed aside. But if their topic is important or their writing is very good, those articles might be collected into a book to be preserved and reread.

Carroll never married, but he loved entertaining children. He was especially fond of the daughters of the dean of his college. Carroll often took the girls, Alice, Lorina, and Edith Liddell, on picnic trips and amused them by making up stories. One story told of a young girl named Alice who fell down a rabbit hole into Wonderland, a magical place where nothing was what it seemed. Young Alice Liddell asked Carroll to write the story down..

Rodin started out working for building decorators. Later, Rodin became a sculptor's assistant. In 1864, at age 24, Rodin publically showed his first major sculpture, ""The Man with the Broken Nose."" The official art critics of the time did not like it. They believed art should be about beauty. To them, Rodin's sculpture was about something ""ugly"" and ordinary. When he was 37 years old, Rodin sculpted ""The Age of Bronze."" It was so unusual and realistic that people said he must have molded it on a real person! After years of struggle, Rodin finally had become known as a great sculptor.",art,3,Advanced,4

Many of these countries support their craftspeople, usually by helping them to sell their work. Folk artists typically produce useful things such as furniture, toys, jewelry, clothing, musical instruments, weapons, religious symbols, and household tools. They craft these objects from easy-to-find or recycled materials such as wire, wood, and natural fibers. Every region of the world has produced folk art in unique styles.

2022,"A 15-year old girl, Ann Makosinski from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada has invented a flashlight that uses the heat from your hand for power. Instead of using batteries the flashlight uses Peltier tiles. Peltier tiles produce electricity when one side of the tile is heated and the other is cooled. In her first attempts, she was able to produce enough power, but not enough voltage. But eventually, she was able to find a solution and produce a working flashlight. Makosinki was able to build the flashlight for under 30 dollars. And considering you will never need to buy batteries, it's a great deal. She is currently one of 15 finalists in the Google Science Fair. The final round will be held in Mountain View, California this September.",technology part 2,4,Intermediate,2

The world record for the long jump, which was set in 1968, remained unbroken for 23 years after African-American athlete Bob Beaman jumped 8.9 metres. The high jump was revolutionised during the 1968 Olympics with the invention of the Fosbury Flop.

There is also some evidence that being scared can help a person manage stressful situations. Things like giving a presentation in front of your class or performing in a school play can make us fearful and anxious.

Drinking herbal tea, you're exposed to a wide range of protective compounds. They may be present to protect the plant but – because we evolved alongside the plant – they help us maintain health and strength, too.

So, if you suffer from seasonal depression or anxiety, turmeric can be a real boost.

The problem is that when you lie in bed looking at your phone, you're often only looking at it with one eye while the other is blocked by the pillow, explain the researchers. This causes ""photopigment bleaching"" in the eye that adapts to the bright screen light, while the other eye is busy adapting to the dark of your pillow.

Anxiety and parenting seem to go hand-in-hand, and my own need for control is certainly borne out of fear – a fear that if I don't, everything will fall apart. But the danger is that by not allowing children the freedom to learn from their mistakes, they won't become resilient, confident human beings.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2332,"If you really didn't get on with your siblings, there's only one way to change the pattern in adulthood, which is determination and the will to work it out. 'I remember one brother and sister who came to couple therapy because they felt it was so important to restore their relationship,' says psychologist and therapist Martin Lloyd-Elliott. Watching my own children, I can see their bond is complex and intense, full of extreme displays of frustration, resentment but also intimacy and love. I hope they can sustain that closeness in adulthood without the rivalry that seems so second nature to them now. You may compete with your siblings all your life, but you are also deeply bonded to them. We need to accept that this is the most layered of our relationships and fight to keep it alive.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2333,"Why do sibling rivalries last so long after childhood? The process involved in creating sibling rivalry is familiar to us: siblings compete for the attention and exclusive love of their parents, and they feel that this is stolen by their brothers and sisters. This dynamic often continues into adulthood and can become a bitter conflict. This is because, according to Freud, 'the unconscious isn't aware of passing time'. 'Children who didn't get enough recognition from their parents can remain stuck in needy relationships all their lives,' says child psychiatrist Sarah Stern. The recognition we longed to see in our parents' eyes, we start to look for elsewhere – friends, bosses, lovers. But these are nothing compared to the expectations we have of our brothers and sisters.",family,4,Advanced,4
2334,"Gaining knowledge and skills brings freshness to life, satisfies basic psychological needs and creates healthy challenges. We take the fact that our kids are learning for granted, because they spend most of their time in school. Yet, unless they're interested and invested in what they're learning, the psychological benefits are unlikely to follow. What have they enjoyed learning recently? It could be a skill, such as playing an instrument, a new book, something interesting from a TV programme or insights gained from a discussion. Try learning something new or introduce them to one of your interests. Set a challenge you would enjoy achieving together. Learning new things together will bring you closer, while communicating that it can be done any time, at any age, and not always in school.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2335,"A study launched in the 1970s by Örebro University in Sweden in which couples agreed to equally share the burden at work and home by both working part-time and spending equal time at home, taking on half of the household tasks and childcare each, found surprising results. Thirty years on, the couples reported that their decision to share responsibilities equally was not only good for their relationship, but also their family as a whole. Most interestingly, the male participants did not report that their career had suffered a negative impact by them dedicating less time to work and more to home. In fact, the men noted that their choice actually served their careers well because the extra responsibility they took on at home was valued highly as experience in management.",family,4,Advanced,4
2336,"Could eating meals together as a family protect our children from becoming overweight? A new study seems to think so. According to the research, which was published in The Journal of Pediatrics in 2014, 60 per cent of children who said they never ate family meals were overweight. Interestingly, 10 years later, 29 per cent of these children who had participated had become obese. Even eating meals as a family as infrequently as once or twice a week was found to significantly reduce the chance of children becoming overweight 10 years on, compared to those children who never ate meals as a family during their childhood. The researchers suggest their findings are a result of family meals being more likely to be healthy, children being exposed to a healthy model of eating into adulthood.",family,4,Advanced,4
2337,"According to new research published in the journal PLOS One this year, half of new mothers are still excessively sleepy during the daytime four months after giving birth, raising the question of whether a four-month maternity break is sufficient for working mums. The research also found that it was sleep quality rather than quantity that is important. Sleep disruption strongly influences daytime functioning including the capacity to deal with the unexpected, changing situations and distractions, as well as the ability to evaluate risks, the research says. And while the implications of sleep loss on shift-workers and commercial drivers has long been examined, postpartum women are largely overlooked.",family,4,Advanced,4
2338,"The role of the father is often overlooked. We tend to assume that a father doesn't need to be as communicative, or as involved, as a mother. Often we believe that fathers aren't as insightful or as emotionally skilled as mothers. 'The overall message is that fathers are less necessary except when it comes to money,' says Linda Nielsen, author of Embracing Your Father. 'Yet all the research shows that a father's relationship with his daughter is at least as important in so many areas of her life – showing her how to express herself, how to relate to other men, how to be self-reliant.' Those lessons are being delivered not by what he tells you, but by how he interacts with you and your mother.",family,4,Advanced,4
2339,"Do you see your child as a miniature version of you, or as a one-of-a-kind individual? No matter how many of your qualities they've inherited, they are not destined to repeat your mistakes. One of the best gifts you can give your child is the independence to make their own decisions. 'Many of us were managers before we were parents, so it can help to think of it as delegation,' says Gardner. 'When you delegate something, you don't expect the other person to do it precisely as you would.' A child's picture of success is different from yours, so be careful not to impose your values on them. 'If they make an Airfix model and all the parts are attached in the wrong order, you may see mistakes but they see something they're proud of,' says Gardner.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2340,"Hartley Brewer believes there is a whole host of ways in which we can do more to affirm our sons and make life easier for them. She advises praising boys at every opportunity, especially when they're little; avoiding criticism and unfavourable comparisons; accepting the ways in which they are different from girls, and rewarding them for the many things they are naturally good at. 'Boys are wonderful problem-solvers. They are very good at coming up with innovative solutions. Boys are very responsive to praise, but it works the other way too: if we make them feel unaccepted and unacceptable, they will quickly start to misbehave and play up.' For many mothers, this means being aware of their own inbuilt bias towards girls and femaleness.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2341,"Boys are not just different from girls, but also in many ways more vulnerable. Boys are born six weeks behind girls developmentally, a gap that widens throughout childhood right up to puberty, by which time they are two years behind. In infancy, boys cry more, take longer to settle, are slower to learn to walk, talk and potty train. They have more difficulty adapting to school. Reading, writing, sitting still all come harder to small boys. Socially, too, they lag behind girls. Behavioural problems and mental illnesses are more common at all ages in boys than girls. In adolescence, boys do less well at school, leave school earlier, and are more likely than girls to die, in road accidents, from substance abuse, in fights and by suicide. The vast majority of young offenders are boys.",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2342,"'A mother teaches a boy a great deal about life and love,' says Biddulph. 'She is his ""first love"", and needs to be tender, respectful and playful, without dominating his world.' Mothers invariably take the lead in this social learning. 'It never occurs to my husband to ask our sons how they're feeling,' says Helena, 41. 'I always encouraged my boys to talk. But you can't just sit them down and say ""talk to me"" like you might with a girl. You have to come at it sideways.' Perhaps the hardest task of all for mothers is knowing how and when to let their sons go. As boys mature, mothers have to let them push us away at times. As they get older, boys need to feel they're in charge of their lives. That means letting them make mistakes and letting them set their own boundaries.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2343,"Play to a child is what work is to an adult. It is how children learn, grow, have fun and overcome challenges. It is the way by which they make sense of the world and learn how to be within it. Thankfully, we have moved away from the era of regarding children's play as a mere way to pass the time. It is now known that play is essential to a child's development and wellbeing. Offering your child a mix of play opportunities is the ideal. Children need to imagine and they need to act out (as language is still not their main mode of expression) and play gives them a safe structure within which to do this and in a way which they can control (in contrast to the rest of a child's life which is heavily controlled by adults around them).",family,4,Intermediate,2
2344,"Sadly, children spend half as much time outside as they did only 20 years ago. While in nature, allow your children to touch anything they want (within reason), including dirt, mud, trees, plants, insects, etc.
Bring a bucket, some water, and a shovel the next time you're at a park or on a hike—it takes only minutes before most of them start making mud pies or decide to give themselves (and you!) a mud facial. If the dirt gets in their mouths, don't freak out; they'll soon realize that dirt doesn't taste all that good and likely won't develop a habit for it. Most kids have this innate desire to get dirty, but in their modern lives this needs to be nurtured. Do your child a favor and encourage her to play with dirt!",family,4,Intermediate,2
2345,"The authors propose a couple of reasons why a happy person might improve the health of their lover. First, a happy spouse is a better caretaker; he or she is more likely to have the emotional energy to look after a significant other. Secondly, happy spouses make life easier for their partners because their partners aren't stressed by the fact that their closest companion is always in a bad mood, and they're not exhausted by efforts to jolly them along or under constant pressure not to upset them. One of the ways the researchers think this works is that the happy soul becomes a proxy for their partner, so the gloomy individual behaves as a non-gloomy person would. ""It's compensatory,"" says Chopik. ""Another person's happiness is filling you up, so you do these healthy things.""",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2346,"Summertime is prime time for family visits. But much as we love our families, those visits can seem like the last thing a kid would want to do with their summer—and they can cause plenty of friction. Making the most of a family visit isn't just about trying to make everything goes smoothly, says Marshall Duke, professor of psychology at Emory. His team's studies of kids' connections with extended family uncovered an important principle: ""the more kids know about their families, the stronger they are."" From the elementary age on, Duke says, the most important thing to do is simply make space for kids to hear family stories,"" says Duke. So instead of packing family vacations with back to back activities, make sure there's some space to sit around and let the stories flow.""",family,4,Intermediate,2
2347,"Respecting our children's reality means letting them feel, think, and experience things in a different way than we do. It sounds easy—until you discover that it's different from your own. That's when many parents turn to threats, force, and ordering kids around. One of the best ways to build a bridge between your reality and the child's is through empathy. When we practice empathy with our kids, we show respect for their feelings and their unique experience of the world. Practicing empathy shows that we are really listening, and that we understand their point of view. Not respecting our children's reality is something we are generally unaware of doing. We really have to pay attention to notice the ways in which we unintentionally disregard or question their feelings and perspective.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2348,"The new school year offers kids a chance to start something new. And the benefits of trying something new—at any time of year—are high, says Robyn Silverman, a child and teen development specialist. And when all those things converge, says Silverman, we discover something even more important: ""what our passions are."" Elementary age kids need concrete examples. To help them understand the value of trying something, she'll often ask kids to think about their favorite thing or person–and then remind them that ""if you had never tried that, you would have no idea it was one of your favorites."" Parents can help kids step out by encouraging them to name their worries, but also to name what might help them overcome their fears.",family,4,Advanced,4
2349,"As early as possible, says Stephen Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University, elementary age kids ""should learn what to do in the water, how to swim and how to float."" And as kids are getting comfortable in the water, parents can encourage them to think about safety at the beach. One place to start: what do kids themselves feel cautious about? Parents may be surprised to learn kids are feeling leery of sea creatures, or bothered by the sun, and take the opportunity to talk more about sharing the water with wildlife, or the importance of sunscreen—as well as getting across the absolute basics of beach safety: young kids shouldn't go into deep water, and should always stay near their parents or a lifeguard.",family,4,Intermediate,2

Parents can start conversations with them about the fact that ""the laws of science are the same everywhere,"" and then help kids get curious about making comparisons between earth and space. The surface of the earth is very new, and because of our tectonics and weather, it gets worked over all the time. But the moon preserves the history of the solar system, how the solar system was formed, and how the earth was formed.

As well as allowing parents to continue their commitments after the end of the school year – perhaps working, looking for work, studying, training, additional caring responsibilities – holiday clubs provide a safe, child-centered environment where children can form friendships, take part in a range of activities, gain new skills and experiences, and be better prepared for the following year.""",family,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

2353,"Play is most enjoyable and most informative for children if they lead it, which is why child-led play is popular. Parents can encourage play by following their child's lead, stepping in and out when needed, and going with their child's flow of play. Children structure their play very differently to how adults would, so it's important not to put your own agenda onto the play. I would argue there is no such thing as unhealthy play. If during active physical play children hit each other and become upset, then that kind of play can be discouraged, but otherwise the rest of the play time can be seen as healthy. Even moments of disagreement can be healthy as they are valuable opportunities for children to learn about themselves and others through developing skills of negotiation.",family,4,Intermediate,2
2354,"Children play differently with others their age versus others of a different age. Research with siblings has shown that a child's play is more sophisticated and complex if they are playing with older siblings. So, it's about getting the right balance between children playing with older children so that they can learn new skills and be pushed out of their comfort zone a bit, and children not feeling so anxious about being left behind/unable to do something compared to their playmate, ending up with the child closing up and stopping the play. It's also important to provide toys which allow for individual play, as this provides children with the opportunity to build their confidence before involving new friends.",family,4,Intermediate,2

But by the time a baby is about 10 months old, he begins to narrow down the range of sounds to those that he hears around him. So if you want your child to learn a second language, it's best to introduce it in the first year of life. If you are a bilingual family (or have a bilingual caregiver), have one parent (and/or caregiver) speak the second language to the baby all the time so he has a chance to become fully ""immersed"" in it. If you haven't begun the second language in the first year, it's best to wait until your child is about 2-1/2 - or until after he has undergone a ""vocabulary explosion"" in his first language, which generally begins at 18 to 20 months.",family,4,Intermediate,2

I tell parents and teachers we can encourage this by giving them simple choices from a very early age. 'This drink or that?' 'These shorts or those?' It's a limited freedom that lets them explore their free will. Later, you will attach consequences to these choices – if you make the wrong choice, then there is a price to be paid. If you choose to throw your food on the floor you don't get your pudding. The choice is still theirs, but the consequence informs their behaviour.

Some parents prefer to give a regular weekly amount which their children are expected to cover their day to day spending with, like bowling trips or buying a weekly magazine.

'Typical first-borns are approval-seeking missiles,' says Grose. A study of Norwegians born between 1912 and 1975 found that educational achievement was highest in first-borns and diminished the further down the birth order you got, despite little difference in IQ.

In this atmosphere of hostility, a group of Modenese soldiers slipped into the centre of Bologna and stole a wooden bucket filled with money and jewels. The Bolognese demanded the return of the bucket. The Modenese refused, so the Bolognse declared war on Modena. Bologna put together an army of 32,000 men and marched against Modena in November 1325. Over 7,000 Modenese met them in Bolognese territory. Despite being seriously outnumbered, the Modenese won the Battle of Zappolino (the only battle of the war) and the Bolognese fled to their city. About 2,000 men were killed on both sides. The bucket remains in Modena to this day.",history,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

Traditionally, post boxes have the Latin initials of the king or queen who is reigning at the time of installation. So, you can find some with VR (for Victoria Regina – Queen Victoria) or ER VII (for Edvard Rex the seventh – King Edward VII).

This does not mean sitting in class looking out the window, nor listening to other students who do not speak well, nor getting explanations in your own language about how the language works. This means spending time enjoyably connected to the language you are learning. Start to notice words and how they come together as phrases.

Enjoy studying all the time and stop worrying about what you cannot remember, or cannot yet understand, or cannot yet say.

They also found that the top 1,000 words account for 75% of our vocabulary. And with only 7,000 words, you've covered 90% of all of the words you will ever use in your lifetime. The other 10% are words related to extremely specialist subjects.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2
2444,"You have decided to learn another language. Now what? On our recent live chat our panellists first piece of advice was to ask yourself: what do you want to achieve and by when? Donavan Whyte, vice president of enterprise and education at Rosetta Stone, says: ""Language learning is best when broken down into manageable goals that are achievable over a few months. This is far more motivating and realistic."" You might be feeling wildly optimistic when you start but aiming to be fluent is not necessarily the best idea. Phil McGowan, director at Verbmaps, recommends making these goals tangible and specific: ""Why not set yourself a target of being able to read a newspaper article in the target language without having to look up any words in the dictionary?""",learning languages,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2445,"Often the discussion around how to learn a language slides into a debate about so-called traditional vs tech approaches. For Aaron Ralby, director of Linguisticator, this debate misses the point: ""The question is not so much about online vs offline or app vs book. Rather it should be how can we assemble the necessary elements of language for a particular objective, present them in a user-friendly way, and provide a means for students to understand those elements."" When signing up to a particular method or approach, think about the substance behind the style or technology. ""Ultimately,"" he says, ""the learning takes place inside you rather that outside, regardless of whether it's a computer or book or a teacher in front of you.""",learning languages,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
2446,"The internet has good enough resources to let you achieve a decent level in most languages from the comfort of your home, but for many of us, learning in isolation is difficult and boring. Even if it's scary to walk into a new room of language lovers, leave the house and connect with other learners right from the start. You can find local conversation groups and language cafes in libraries and community centres. If you live near a university, the international student community is another hot spot for language exchanges and events. Many foreigners in your city will be happy to meet you and hold a language exchange, where you offer mutual support to each other by helping your partner learn your language.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2
2447,"If you do decide to take your language learning further, consider investing in small group or one-to-one tuition. The accountability that comes with lessons creates a boost of ongoing motivation that is almost impossible to find for free. Most private tutors will offer you a free or cheap trial lesson. These don't mean there is a hidden obligation to buy. Instead, a good tutor will want to learn as much as possible about you before charging you money. Once you get started, it's easy to get past the idea that studying a foreign language comes with a big financial burden. Remember to take your time and think of your new language as something you will be learning for life, not just for the next six months. There is only one way to fail at language learning, and that is to stop completely.",learning languages,4,Intermediate,2

You can visit local charity shops and pick up phrasebooks, dictionaries and courses for next to nothing. Don't forget that pen and paper are also cheap and invaluable language learning tools. Use them to keep track of new words, write down new sentences in full and create your own flash cards. The theory of deliberate practice shows that it's not your language learning talent that makes the difference, but the amount of time you spend in concentrated and deliberate practice. It's also a good idea to visit your local library and let them surprise you. Libraries have access to a large inter-library loan network.

But don't cheat and only read it in translation! You won't learn much that way. Tip number two: write down the word you don't know in your vocabulary notebook – it sounds tedious but it's so useful to have one – and look up the word in the dictionary.

Instead of growing them from seed, save time and trouble by purchasing plants from your local garden center. Herbs need lots of sun.
Unless you have a very bright window, you'll find them easier to grow outdoors than indoors. They also require excellent drainage. If you're growing them in pots, use a brand-name potting soil and make sure the containers have drainage holes. Outdoors, avoid planting in heavy clay soil and wet spots. Keep the soil moist for the first few weeks after planting, and then let the soil go a little dry before subsequent watering.",home,4,Intermediate,2

Just recently, a survey of 4,000 British houseworkers found that the average homemaker works nine hours every day. So, as the average salary in the UK is €30,000, a British houseworker would earn about €40,000 if they were employed. Also in the survey, 71% of houseworkers said that running the family-home was a full-time job. A nanny in the UK would earn about €48 a day for the same job. Cleaning and tidying for one hour would earn a cleaner almost €8. And for more than an hour of cooking, a chef would earn €20.

To make cleaning easier it is a good idea to give it a quick wipe with a dry, soft cloth after you have used it to get rid of surface dust. Every once in a while condition the surface with neatsfoot oil (made from cattle bones, I am afraid to say).

Clear plastic containers are best—they lock fibers in and dust out and let you see what's inside. When you dust, they're easy to pull off the shelves and wipe clean. Finally, keep closet floors clear. If the floor is cluttered, chances are you'll just bypass it while vacuuming, and dust bunnies will start to collect.

Strength-training should be performed at least twice a week.
If you're new to it, first meet with a certified trainer who can help you learn to avoid injury.

Floodwaters could create too much power, whereas long rainless periods left the factories without any power at all. Today streamlined metal waterwheels called ""turbines"" help produce electricity.

One excellent aspect of water power is that the water can be reused. Unlike such fuels as coal and oil, water does not get used up when harnessed for power. And it doesn't pollute the air either. The power of water lies in the flow of water. The power produced by water depends upon the water's weight and its height of fall, called ""head.""

""We found that among American adults who drink one serving of sugar-sweetened beverages per day, replacing that drink with water lowered the percent of calories coming from drinks from 17 to 11,"" she said.

There is one main difference between organic and non-organic food. Organic farms do not use agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides. In many countries organic foods have special labels. These guarantee that the products are natural.
Some people think organic means locally grown. Originally this was true. Over time organic farming became more difficult. The demand for organic food grew larger than the supply.
Small companies had to sell out to large companies. There wasn't enough organic ingredients, such as grain and cattle. This made it difficult for many organic companies to stay in business.

These can come into contact with organic and non-organic food. Doctors recommend washing produce very carefully. Handling meat carefully is important too.

However, the more we eat, the greedier the dictator in our skull becomes. Several studies have proven that, as a consequence of this process, food begins to take on a drug-like quality. During meals, overweight people exhibit lower levels of activity in the corpus striatum than people of a healthy weight. This is the area of the brain where the reward substance dopamine is released.

If this stress then becomes a long-term problem, it can have a direct impact on our weight. The brain will always look after itself under all circumstances. Renowned brain researcher Dr Achim Peters has been studying the underlying mechanisms of the brain for decades. He has developed the ""Selfish Brain"" theory for a better understanding of obesity: if the organ realises it's lacking even a small amount of glucose, it sounds an alarm – the ""brain pull"".

Good saturated fat has now been linked to the prevention of certain chronic diseases, as well as being found to be an effective tool for weight management. Most notably, cheese is an excellent and easily absorbed source of calcium, that helps to support bone health (for this reason, it's also a truly fabulous snack for growing children).
Of course, separating your good-quality cheese from your processed stuff is the main thing. So do be discerning when you are buying – you want cheese with no additives or preservatives on the label. Even better, buy from producers directly – farmers' markets are great for this.",nutrition,4,Advanced,4

""Comfort eating isn't the best solution but it's the most convenient: it makes you feel better in the blink of an eye, hence the name,"" explains Dr Peters. The problem is that comfort, or ""binge"", eating – when a person wolfs down large quantities of sweet or salty snacks in a short space of time – calms our body's systems, but it doesn't remedy the actual, crucial, cause of our emotions.
Comfort eating is a quick fix and, in the long term, masks the real problem –which continues to eat away at us.

However, when we're stressed we need a lot of cortisol – and demand can outstrip supply. In people with the more relaxed Type B personalities, it demands more energy: feelings of hunger intensify – and the person gains weight. This balances their mood. People with the more competitive Type A personalities, on the other hand, don't experience these pangs of hunger. They tend to be slimmer, but they're also more stressed. Furthermore, studies have proven that overweight patients actually have a greater chance of surviving heart attacks, kidney failure and stroke than their more slender counterparts.",nutrition,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

There was also some interesting information on the properties of tea. The research dispels the myth that tea is dehydrating. ""Even if you had a really, really strong cup of tea, you would still have a net gain of fluid. In terms of fluid intake, we recommend 1.5 to 2 litres per day, and that can include tea.

It's also worth bearing in mind that the most expensive skin creams will not fulfill their promises if you are not keeping yourself hydrated enough, too.

In one European study, rats that were fed GM corn developed tumours and suffered from organ damage. Some scientists fear that GM products are contributing to an increase in food allergies. During genetic modification, proteins are added to the plant. According to Brown University, this could cause allergic reactions as some of the genes used in GM technology might be taken from a food that causes allergies. On top of that new allergens could be produced when genes are mixed across different species.",food,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

The rules stated that competitors should eat as much as they can in the time allocated.
George Shea, the head of the International Federation of Competitive Eating and the master of ceremonies for the event, described the challenge as a modern interpretation of the centuries-old Thanksgiving tradition.

In the 17th century, the Spanish expanded into other colonies in Central America and used African slave labour to manage the harvests. Before long, European nations were planting cacao in colonies around the world. The British took it to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and India, the Dutch introduced it into Indonesia, while the Spanish spread it further across South America. The Portuguese introduced cacao to Africa in the early 19th century. Largely due to this colonial movement, cacao can now be found growing almost anywhere that conditions allow.",food,4,Advanced,4

Swiss chocolate maker Daniel Peter was working with the Swiss confectioner Henri Nestlé and discovered a method of dehydrating milk to remove water. This was key, as moisture is a natural enemy of chocolate, causing it to seize and become unworkable. The chocolate-making process was also improved by a method called ""conching"". Developed by the Swiss inventor Rodolphe Lindt in 1879, the process involves prolonged stirring to improve the flavour of chocolate. Lindt was also one of the first to mix additional cocoa butter through chocolate for a smooth texture – a defining characteristic of Swiss chocolate.",food,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

Despite the simple name, these treats aren't easy to pull off. Levinrad had to perfect the chocolate coating to keep the whole thing from leaking.

They gave me pocket money, but I think this money was designed to be part of my moral education. It wasn't for buying things with - it was for saving. So, when it began, my pocket money was 5p. I had to learn to save and wait until next week for ice-cream. In my childhood world of 1970s Britain, ice-cream was cheap.

This is why I think the problem of things being raw in the middle and burnt on the outside tends to happen. For me, the spirit of a barbecue is about taking your time and celebrating the wonderful smoky flavours that you just can't replicate any other way. I like to balance every dish with a salad that can be prepped in advance. Another thing to remember is that different ingredients need to be cooked at different temperatures – when the barbecue is extra hot it's great for cooking steak or shellfish; when it cools slightly you can get on with cooking heftier pieces of meat.",food,4,Intermediate,2

Usually, travellers go to the main square or the fish market, then find the nearest way out. Lost in the crowd, they need a hand to grab them and lead them around. I was doing similar walks with my foreign friends coming to visit me in Sicily and in the end I just made a business out of it.

When we think about how we can waste less, we naturally consider how we can value food more – how it can provide more flavour and nutrition, and have a positive effect on the place it came from. The root-to-fruit philosophy comes into every decision we make, from where our produce is procured (from clean, ethical producers) to how we cook with thrift in the kitchen, quite literally using the whole ingredient. At Poco, we make beetroot-leaf crisps and caramelise the stems; we deep-fry spring onion roots and serve them alongside the green; and we never peel a thing.",food,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

Yet when the day came, the ingredient measurements I'd taken down during her eyeballed baking process were not enough, and my bread was tough and dense.

Of course, I enjoyed my food but it wasn't something I often talked about. Now, I'm not blaming my culture for my lack of interest in food at an early age. Perhaps my silence was due to the fact that I didn't know anything about food. How many children know that prawns only turn pink when they are cooked and that tuna does not come from a can?

First a boat enters the lock, and the gate is closed behind it. If the boat needs to rise to a higher level, water is added to the lock. As the water rises, the boat floats higher. When the lock is full of water, the gate in front of the boat is opened. The boat can then travel out onto the higher part of the canal.

In summer my family is going to California. I have a mother and a father and a little sister. My mother says she is sick and tired of staying in the house, so we're hitting up Cali. We'll go to Los Angeles. I'm just sort of going along with whatever my mom says.

That's one of my part-time jobs. I finish at 11:00 and get home around 11:30 or so. Usually I go home and eat lunch and get my relaxation for the day.
After lunch I usually go back to the pool either to lifeguard or to hang out with friends. I love to catch a minute, if I can, to read. After that I usually do dinner with the family; that's from 5:00 to 6:00.
At 6:00 I head back to the pool. I coach a night practice. After practice, like 9-ish, I spend time with the family. We play Wii or watch a movie.

Later, we took a bus back to where we were staying. I roomed with three people, and our room was connected to a room with three more boys and one of my friends' dad. That night people were sick. It was from riding Everest.
On the fourth day we went to MGM, and they closed a section of the roller coaster just for the eighth graders. They closed down that part of the park for us and that was the most fun.

On the first day we went to Epcot Center, and they do a lot of scientific research and stuff, so we learned about chemistry there, and we rode on the GM test track and saw some cars like water-powered cars and solar-powered cars.

We were in Wisconsin, and there aren't a lot of Spanish speakers in Wisconsin. The teachers would take me out of class to learn English.
This summer we'll probably go to Myrtle Beach. It's a whole family trip. We go to the beach or hang out at the pool at the hotel. We go out to eat and to the fun park.

I get paid to smile and talk to people. I like this job. It's fun. The bosses train us to do second mile service. They teach us the best ways to talk to the customers. I work in a fast-food restaurant.

Do you know what you'd like to do after high school?
Not really. I have a faint idea. I'd like to go into science or engineering. We did a career finder thing on the computer at school, and it suggested science or engineering for me.

There are a lot of other teams in that league. And my birthday is in four days and I'll be fourteen.
How will you celebrate?
I don't know. I'll probably go play laser tag or something.
I think your parents are divorced. Is that right?
Yeah. I live with my mom normally, and every Thursday I go to my dad's for the evening, from 6:00 to 9:00. Every other weekend I go to my dad's house and stay from Friday to Sunday, and then I go back to my mom's.",teens talk,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

Here was a page with ugly, black spots and scratches upon it; while the very next page showed a lovely little picture.

It was New Year's Eve, and the church clock was striking twelve. ""Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra!"" sounded the horn, and the mail-coach came lumbering up. The clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the town; all the places had been taken, for there were twelve passengers in the coach.

Some of the trees are bending beneath their burdens, while the ground is covered with mellow apples, more than you could eat, my son, in all your lifetime.""
George looked in silence on the orchard, he marked the busy, humming bees, and heard the gay notes of the birds fluttering from tree to tree. His eyes filled with tears and he answered softly:— ""Truly, father, I never will be selfish anymore.""",stories for great holidays,3,Intermediate,2

2842,"You don't know about me unless you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That book was written by Mark Twain, and he holds the truths mainly. Not all parts of the story are true, but most of it is. I don't know anyone who tells the truth all the time, except perhaps Aunt Polly or the Widow Douglas or Tom Sawyer's sister, Mary. These people are written about in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. That book ends like this: Tom and I find money that was stolen and we are allowed to keep it. We become rich. We each have 6,000 dollars in gold. Judge Thatcher put the money in a bank for us, and we can have a dollar a day. That is more money than a person can know how to spend.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

I put on my old clothes and ran away and was free and happy, but Tom Sawyer found me and said that if I want­ed to join his club and be friends, I would have to return to live with the widow. For this reason, I returned to live with her.
The widow cried over me and gave me new clothes to wear, but I hated those new clothes. I felt too warm in them and I could not move my arms and legs freely. When supper was being served, the widow always rang a bell, and I had to come quickly. I was happier when I could eat whenever I chose to, though this meant I had to make meals of the bits of food other people had thrown away.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2844,"The house was very quiet. Everyone was asleep. Far away I heard a clock go boom—boom—boom— 12 times—midnight. Then all was quiet again. Soon I heard a quiet ""Me­yow! Me­yow!"" outside my window. I answered, ""Me­yow! Me­yow!"" as quietly as I could. Then I climbed out of my window onto the porch roof. From the roof I jumped to the ground and walked slowly among the trees. There was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
Tom and I walked quietly along a path among the trees. When we passed near the widow's kitchen, I fell and made a noise. We lay very still. Miss Watson's black slave, Jim, was sitting in the kitchen door. We could see him clearly because there was a light behind him. He stood up and asked, ""Who's there?""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2845,"Jim stood listening, then walked toward us. We didn't make a sound. Then he stood where Tom and I were hiding and asked again, ""Who are you? I know that I heard something. I'll just sit here until I hear the noise again."" Jim sat on the ground between Tom and me. He leaned against the tree we were hiding behind. He almost touched my leg. My nose began to feel uncomfortable and I wanted to rub it, but I dared not. We sat quietly for a long time. Then Jim began to breathe heavily and we knew that he was asleep. Very quietly, Tom and I stood up and walked away.
Then Tom decided that we would need some candles. He also wanted to play a trick on Jim. I didn't like it but Tom loved jokes.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2
2846,"Tom and I walked quickly into town where we could see only three or four lights. Almost everyone was asleep. Near the town was a big river, a mile wide, and very quiet at this time of night. Near the river we found Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and two or three other boys hiding. We climbed into a small boat and traveled two and a half miles down the river before we stopped the boat and went ashore.
Tom led us to some bushes where he made everyone promise to keep his secret. He pushed aside the bushes and showed us a hole in the hill. We lit our candles and used them to light our way through the hole and into a large cave. Soon we came to a kind of underground room where we stopped. Tom said, ""Now we'll start our club and call it Tom Sawyer's Club.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2847,"Tom wrote the program of his club on a sheet of paper and read it to us. All the boys had to promise that they would never tell any of the club's secrets. If they did, other members of the club would kill them and would burn their dead bodies. Some boys thought that it would be a good idea to also kill the families of the boys who told club secrets. Tom added this to the promise.
Then Ben Rogers said, ""Huck Finn doesn't have a family. How can we let him join the club?"" ""Well, he has a father,"" said Tom Sawyer.
""Yes, he has a father, but you can never find him. The boys talked about this problem. They decided that I could not join their club. I became very sad and felt like crying. Then I thought of a solution to my problem. ""Miss Watson can be part of my family.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2848,"Three or four mounths passed, and winter arrived. I went to school almost every day and was learning to read and write and spell. The teacher was also trying to teach me mathematics, but I knew even if I studied forever, I would never learn mathematics.
At the beginning, I hated school very much, but after a while, I hated it less. Whenever I began to hate school, I simply stayed away a few days. The teacher would beat me when I returned, but the beat­ings didn't trouble me. I had become accustomed to living in a proper house with the widow and sleeping in a proper bed. The widow said that I would become a good boy if I continued to study and to improve my character and that she was no longer unhappy with me. My life seemed to be improving.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2849,"One morning, while I was eating breakfast, I poured some salt on the table. It was an accident. I knew that it was bad luck to acci­dentally pour salt and that the only way to get rid of the bad luck was to throw some salt over my left shoulder. But Miss Watson stopped my hand and shouted, ""Take your hands away from that salt, Huckleberry. You've already made the table dirty. Don't make it dirtier."" I knew that I couldn't stop the bad luck; it would follow me always. I quickly left the table and ran out of the house. I was worried and frightened. I knew that something bad was going to happen to me, but I didn't know where or when it would happen.
I walked through the front garden and climbed over a high fence. Snow was on the ground, and I could see tracks made by a man's shoes in the snow.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2850,"I stood up quickly and was soon running down the hill. I looked over my shoulder, but didn't see anyone following me. I ran to Judge Thatcher's house as quickly as I could.
""Hello, Huckleberry, why have you been running? Did you come to ask me about your money? Do you need a few dollars?"" ""No, sir,"" I answered. ""Did the bank send you some money for me?""
""Yes, more than 150 dollars. That's a large amount of money. I would like to keep it for you, together with your 6,000 dollars. If I give you all the money now, you'll only spend it on foolish things."" ""I don't want to spend my money. I don't even want it ever. Not even the 6,000 dollars. I want you to have it. I want to give all my money to you.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2851,"I went to Jim and told him about the tracks that I had seen in the snow. I told him that I knew that Pap was in town again because I knew that he had made a cross with two nails in the heel of his left shoe. I wanted to know what Pap was planning to do. Would he stay in St. Petersburg a long time?
Jim took his hair ball and said some words over it. Then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. The hair ball rolled a short distance. Jim did this several times, but the hair ball acted the same each time. Jim put his ear against it and listened, but he heard nothing. He said that the hair ball would not talk unless I gave him some money. I gave Jim twenty-­five cents, and he put the money under the hair ball. This time the hair ball talked to Jim, and he told me what it said.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2
2852,"I closed the door. I turned around, and there he was. I expected to be frightened of him now, but I wasn't.
Pap was nearly fifty years old. His black hair was long and un­combed and dirty. He had allowed hair to grow on his face, and where his skin showed, the skin was sickly white. Just looking at the white skin made me feel sick. His clothes?—dirty and torn. His feet showed through large holes in his shoes. His hat was on the floor—an old black hat with a large hole in it.
I stood looking at him. He sat looking back at me. I put my light­ed candle down. I noticed that the window was open; that's how he had come into the room.
""Clean clothes. New shoes. You think highly of yourself, don't you?"" he sneered.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2853,"""Be careful what you say to me. I've been in this town for two days and all the people tell me how rich you are. I heard about your money when I was far away down the river. That's why I am here. I want your money. I want you to get it for me tomorrow."" ""I don't have any money."" ""You're telling a lie. Judge Thatcher has your money. Get the money from him! I want it!"" ""I don't have any money. Please believe me. Ask Judge Thatcher. He'll tell you that I have no money."" ""I'll ask him tomorrow. I'll force him to give me your money. How much money do you have in your pocket?"" ""I have only a dollar, and I want it to—"" ""I don't care why you want it. Give it to me now."" Pap took the dollar and said that he was going into town to buy something.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2854,"Pap again went to court to try to force judge Thatcher give him my money. He also tried to stop me from attending school. When he saw me going to school, he would catch me and beat me. But I continued to go to school, and tried to prevent Pap from seeing me. I wasn't happy going to school before, but now I went because I knew that it made Pap unhappy. Some days I would ask Judge Thatcher for two or three dollars, which I gave to Pap. He would buy whiskey with the money and get very drunk and start fights with men in town.
Pap began coming to the widow's house to see me. She told him to stay away or she would cause trouble for him. This made him very angry. He told her that he had authority over his son and she couldn't tell him how he must act around his son, what he could and could not do to me.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2855,"The next day, Pap caught me alone near the river. He pushed me into a small boat, and we traveled three miles up the Mississippi. We crossed to the Illinois shore to a place where there were many trees and no houses. Pap took me to a small cabin made of logs. This cabin was so hidden in the trees that no one could see it from the river.
Pap stayed with me all the time, and I never had the opportuni­ty to run away. Whenever Pap left the cabin, he would lock me inside and take the key with him. At night, he slept with the key under his pillow. He had a gun, which he had stolen, and we used it to hunt ani­mals for our food. We also fished in the river. I never had to do any work or any studying. We spent most of the time fishing or just sitting and watch­ing the river.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Advanced,4
2856,"Pap stayed away from the cabin often. Once he stayed away for three days, and I was locked inside alone. I didn't enjoy that. When he was away for long periods of time, I began to worry that he would never return. What would happen to me? I could die locked inside the cabin. I began to think of a way to escape. I found an old dirty saw that Pap didn't know was in the cabin. With this tool, I began to saw a hole through one of the logs in the wall behind my bed. I wanted to make a hole large enough to climb through and escape. Making such a hole was going to take a long time, and I worked at it whenever Pap was out of the cabin. I kept the saw hidden while Pap was home. When Pap would leave, I pushed the bed away from the wall and sawed at the log.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Intermediate,2
2857,"One day, Pap returned from a trip to the store feeling very angry. He began to shout and knock furniture to the floor. His lawyer had told him that he would never be able to force Judge Thatcher to give him the money. He also said that he heard that the widow Douglas was again asking the court to take me away from him, and this time the lawyer thought that the widow would succeed.
I knew that I did not want to return to living with the widow. I could never return to living in a proper house and going to school. I had become accustomed to the type of life that Pap and I lived and I didn't want to change again.
Pap said that he would never allow the courts to take me away from him. He would hide me in another cabin six or seven miles away, and no one would ever find me. I began to worry.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2858,"Pap told me to go to his boat and bring the food that he had bought at the store. I carried one heavy load into the cabin and returned for a second. I sat by the boat and thought about my problem. Where would I go once I escaped from the cabin? I began to make a plan; I would take Pap's gun and walk through the forest as far as I could go. I would walk mostly at night and would hunt animals for food. I would travel far away, and neither Pap nor the widow would find me again. That was my plan.
I finished unloading the boat and carried the last of Pap's things to the cabin. It was beginning to get dark and Pap was very angry because I had taken a very long time to unload the boat. He shouted at me to cook his supper. Then he began to shout about the government.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2859,"Pap continued to shout about the government and the wrongs that it had done to him.
""I hate this government and I hate its laws. The law wants to take my son away from me—my very own son. I had all the trouble and all the worry and all the expense of raising him, and now the government wants to take him away from me. Now that my son is old enough to work and give me money, the government wants to take that son away from me. The law and the courts help Judge Thatcher to keep my son's money. I could be a rich man if the law would force Judge Thatcher to give me the 6,000 dollars. I have to live in this dirty cabin and wear old, torn clothes and eat food that pigs will not eat, all because the government won't force Judge Thatcher to give me my son's money.""",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Advanced,4
2860,"It was late at night, and I became very tired. I could no longer keep myself awake. I don't know how long I slept, but suddenly I heard a loud scream and was awake. Pap looked wild and was running around the cabin shouting about poisonous snakes that were attempting to kill him. He was having a dream, but I had never seen him act this wild before.
""Take the snakes off me! Take them off! They're biting my neck!"" Pap screamed and threw chairs against the wall and knocked down the table. He ran around the room, waving his knife in the air. Finally, he was too tired to move. He took a blanket and wrapped it around himself and lay on the floor. He would cry quietly, then shout, then would cry again. I had had many bad experiences with him in the past, but nothing had ever been as bad as this.",the adventures of huckleberry finn,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
2861,"""Stand up! Why are you asleep?"" I opened my eyes and looked around. I could see Pap standing over me looking very angry—and sick, too.
""Why are you holding that gun?"" he asked.
I knew that Pap had forgotten all that had occurred the night before.
I answered, ""Someone tried to get into the cabin last night. I took the gun to protect us."" ""You should have awakened me."" ""I tried. I really tried. I shook you, but you continued to sleep."" ""Don't stand there talking all day. Go to the river to catch some fish for breakfast. I'm hungry."" Pap unlocked the door, and I walked along the river until I found a good place to fish. I noticed many branches floating on the river. The river was much deeper than it was normally and was flowing much faster. Several large logs floated down the river.

I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, ""Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!"" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.

She drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.
Wendy came first, then John, then Michael. There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.

2885,"As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2886,"On John's footer days Nana never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair. No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2887,"Mr. Darling had sometimes a feeling that Nana did not admire him. ""I know she admires you tremendously, George,"" Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never be ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2888,"Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.
If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.",peter pan part 1,2,Intermediate,2
2889,"I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.",peter pan part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2890,"Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2891,"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.
Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was in children's minds. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2892,"At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
""Besides,"" she said to Wendy, ""he would be grown up by this time.""
""Oh no, he isn't grown up,"" Wendy assured her confidently, ""and he is just my size.""
Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.
""Mark my words,"" he said, ""it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it will blow over.""",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2893,"Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: ""I do believe it is that Peter again!""
""Whatever do you mean, Wendy?""
""It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,"" Wendy said, sighing. She was a tidy child and didn't like when Peter did such things.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2894,"Wendy explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.
""What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking.""
""I think he comes in by the window,"" she said.
""My love, it is three floors up.""
""Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?""
It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.
""My child,"" the mother cried, ""why did you not tell me of this before?""
""I forgot,"" said Wendy lightly.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2895,"On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2896,"While Mrs. Darling slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.
But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4
2897,"Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.
She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2898,"Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung it out at the window, meaning ""He is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.""
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: ""It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.""
She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!",peter pan part 1,2,Intermediate,2
2899,"They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.
""I won't go to bed,"" he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, ""I won't, I won't. Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won't be bathed, I won't, I won't!""
Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2900,"Mrs. Darling had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying: ""I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,"" in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion. Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done. Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
Michael had nearly cried.
""Nobody wants me,"" he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
""I do,"" she said, ""I so want a third child.""
Then he had leapt into her arms.",peter pan part 1,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2901,"Mr. Darling came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
""Why, what is the matter, father dear?""
""Matter!"" he yelled; he really yelled. ""This tie, it will not tie.""
He became dangerously sarcastic.
""Not round my neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no; begs to be excused!""
He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, ""I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner tonight, and if I don't go out to dinner tonight, I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.""",peter pan part 1,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

""I wonder,"" Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, ""I wonder.""
It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.
""It is nobody I know,"" he said, examining it carefully, ""but it does look a scoundrel.""
""We were still discussing it, you remember,"" says Mr. Darling, ""when Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.""
Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine.",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2923,"Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, ""It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,"" but Wendy was wiser.
""That is not Nana's unhappy bark,"" she said, little guessing what was about to happen; ""that is her bark when she smells danger.""
""Danger!""
""Are you sure, Wendy?""
""Oh, yes.""
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, ""Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party tonight!""",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2924,"Mr. and Mrs. Darling were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side tonight, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling, the smallest of all the stars screamed out: ""Now, Peter!""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2925,"For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.
There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light. It was a girl called Tinker Bell.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2926,"""Tinker Bell,"" Peter called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, ""Tink, where are you?"" She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?""
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss happence to the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2927,"Wendy sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.
""Boy,"" she said courteously, ""why are you crying?""
Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.
""What's your name?"" he asked.
""Wendy Moira Angela Darling,"" she replied with some satisfaction. ""What is your name?""
""Peter Pan.""
She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively short name.
""Is that all?""
""Yes,"" he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name.
""I'm so sorry,"" said Wendy Moira Angela.
""It doesn't matter,"" Peter gulped.",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2928,"Wendy asked where Peter lived.
""Second to the right,"" said Peter, ""and then straight on till morning.""
""What a funny address!""
Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address.
""No, it isn't,"" he said.
""I mean,"" Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, ""is that what they put on the letters?""
He wished she had not mentioned letters.
""Don't get any letters,"" he said contemptuously.
""But your mother gets letters?""
""Don't have a mother,"" he said. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a tragedy.
""O Peter, no wonder you were crying,"" she said, and got out of bed and ran to him.
""I wasn't crying about mothers,"" he said rather indignantly. ""I was crying because I can't get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn't crying.""",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2929,"Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. ""How awful!"" she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!
Fortunately she knew at once what to do. ""It must be sewn on,"" she said, just a little patronisingly.
""What's sewn?"" he asked.
""You're dreadfully ignorant.""
""No, I'm not.""
But she was exulting in his ignorance. ""I shall sew it on for you, my little man,"" she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife sewing bag, and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.
""I daresay it will hurt a little,"" she warned him.
""Oh, I shan't cry,"" said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2930,"Peter clenched his teeth and did not cry while Wendy was sewing it on, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.
""Perhaps I should have ironed it,"" Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself.
""How clever I am!"" he crowed rapturously, ""oh, the cleverness of me!""
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities.
But for the moment Wendy was shocked.
""You conceit braggart,"" she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; ""of course I did nothing!""
""You did a little,"" Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2931,"To induce her to look up Peter pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.
""Wendy,"" he said, ""don't withdraw. I can't help crowing, Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself."" Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly. ""Wendy,"" he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, ""Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.""
Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.
""Do you really think so, Peter?""
""Yes, I do.""
""I think it's perfectly sweet of you,"" she declared, ""and I'll get up again,"" and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she meant.",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2932,"They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with more questions.
""But where do you live mostly now?""
""With the lost boys.""
""Who are they?""
""They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.""
""What fun it must be!""
""Yes,"" said cunning Peter, ""but we are rather lonely. You see we have no female companionship.""
""Are none of the others girls?""
""Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their prams.""
This flattered Wendy immensely. ""I think,"" she said, ""it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.""",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2933,"Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there.
""And I know you meant to be kind,"" she said, relenting, ""so you may give me a kiss.""
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses.
""I thought you would want it back,"" he said a little bitterly, and offered to return her the thimble.
""Oh dear,"" said the nice Wendy, ""I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.""
""What's that?""
""It's like this."" She kissed him.
Peter thimbled her, and immediately she screeched. ""What is it, Wendy?""
""It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.""
""That must have been Tink.""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2934,"Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.
""She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a thimble.""
""But why?""
""Why, Tink?""
Peter could not understand why, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories.
""You see, I don't know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any stories.""
""How perfectly awful,"" Wendy said.
""Do you know,"" Peter asked ""why swallows build in the eaves of houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you such a lovely story.""
""Which story was it?""
""About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper.""
""Peter,"" said Wendy excitedly, ""that was Cinderella.""",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2
2935,"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and hurried to the window.
""Where are you going?"" Wendy cried with misgiving.
""To tell the other boys.""
""Don't go Peter,"" she entreated, ""I know such lots of stories.""
Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who first tempted him.
He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have alarmed her, but did not.
""Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!"" she cried, and then Peter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.
""Let me go!"" she ordered him.
""Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.""
Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, ""Oh dear, I can't. Think of mummy! Besides, I can't fly.""",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2936,"""Oh, how lovely to fly.""
""I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go.""
""Oo!"" she exclaimed rapturously.
""Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.""
""Oo!""
""And, Wendy, there are mermaids.""
""Mermaids! With tails?""
""Such long tails.""
""Oh,"" cried Wendy, ""to see a mermaid!""
He had become frightfully cunning. ""Wendy,"" he said, ""how we should all respect you.""
She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor.
But he had no pity for her.
""Wendy,"" he said, the sly one, ""you could tuck us in at night.""
""None of us has ever been tucked in at night. And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has any pockets.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2937,"""Of course it's awfully fascinating!"" she cried. ""Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?""
""If you like,"" he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael and shook them.
""Wake up,"" she cried, ""Peter Pan has come and he is to teach us to fly.""
John rubbed his eyes. ""Then I shall get up,"" he said. Of course he was on the floor already.
""Hello,"" he said, ""I am up!""
Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2938,"""Out with the light! Hide! Quick!"" cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.
Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.
""There, you suspicious brute,"" she said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace. ""Everyone of the little angels sound asleep in bed.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2939,"Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.
But Liza was dense.
""No more of it, Nana,"" she said, pulling her out of the room. ""I warn you if bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just.""
She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring master and missus home from the party! That was just what she wanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it.",peter pan part 2,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2940,"We now return to the nursery.
""It's all right,"" John announced, emerging from his hiding- place. ""I say, Peter, can you really fly?""
Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way.
""How topping!"" said John and Michael.
""How sweet!"" cried Wendy.
""Yes, I'm sweet, oh, I am sweet!"" said Peter, forgetting his manners again.
It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
""I say, how do you do it?"" asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a practical boy.
""You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,"" Peter explained. He showed them again.
""You're so nippy at it,"" John said, ""couldn't you do it very slowly once?""
Peter did it both slowly and quickly.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2941,"""I've got it now, Wendy!"" cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.
Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.
""Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,"" he said, ""and let go.""
They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.
""I flewed!"" he screamed while still in mid-air.
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4
2942,"Mr. and Mrs. Darling were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever.",peter pan part 2,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

2953,"She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively short name.
""Is that all?""
""Yes,"" he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a shortish name.
""I'm so sorry,"" said Wendy.
""It doesn't matter,"" Peter gulped.",peter pan part 2,2,Intermediate,2

2961,They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.,peter pan part 2,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2962,"Children were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.
""I say,"" cried John, ""why shouldn't we all go out?""
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.
""Mermaids!"" said Peter again.
""And there are pirates.""
""Pirates,"" cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, ""let us go at once.""
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2963,"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make her heart go softly.
Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end.
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out: ""Cave, Peter!""
Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose.
""Come,"" he cried, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy.
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were flown.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2964,"""Second to the right, and straight on till morning.""
That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.
At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy. John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.
Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2965,"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.
Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2966,"Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.
He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.
""Be more polite to him,"" Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing ""Follow my Leader.""
""Then tell him to stop showing off,"" said John.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2967,"When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.
""You must be nice to him,"" Wendy impressed on her brothers. ""What could we do if he were to leave us!""
""We could go back,"" Michael said.
""How could we ever find our way back without him?""
""Well, we could go on,"" said John.
""That is the awful thing, John. We don't know how to stop.""
John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2968,"Indeed children were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.
Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.
He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2969,"Sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.
""I'm Wendy,"" she said agitatedly.
He was very sorry.
""I say, Wendy,"" he whispered to her, ""always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying 'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.""
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice, ""We get off here.""",peter pan part 3,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
2970,"""There it is,"" said Peter calmly.
""Where, where?""
""Where all the arrows are pointing.""
Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.
Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays.
Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2971,"Peter's careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.
""They don't want us to land,"" he explained.
""Who are they?"" Wendy whispered, shuddering.
But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2972,"Peter's courage was almost appalling. ""Would you like an adventure now,"" he said casually to John, ""or would you like to have your tea first?""
Wendy said ""tea first"" quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.
""What kind of adventure?"" he asked cautiously.
""There's a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,"" Peter told him.
""I don't see him,"" John said after a long pause.
""I do.""
""Suppose,"" John said, a little huskily, ""he were to wake up.""
""Who is captain now?""
""Hook,"" answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that hated word.
Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for they knew Hook's reputation.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2973,"For the moment children were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.
""She tells me,"" he said, ""that the pirates sighted us before the darkness came, and got Long Tom out.""
""The big gun?""
""Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are near it they are sure to let fly.""
""Tell her to go away at once, Peter,"" the three cried simultaneously, but he refused.
""She thinks we have lost the way,"" he replied stiffly, ""and she is rather frightened. You don't think I would send her away all by herself when she is frightened!""",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2974,"For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a loving little pinch.
""Then tell her,"" Wendy begged, ""to put out her light.""
""She can't put it out.
That is about the only thing fairies can't do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.""
""Then tell her to sleep at once,"" John almost ordered.
""She can't sleep except when she's sleepy. It is the only other thing fairies can't do.""
""Seems to me,"" growled John, ""these are the only two things worth doing.""
Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.
""If only one of us had a pocket,"" Peter said, ""we could carry her in it.""
However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a pocket between the four of them. He had a happy idea. John's hat!",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2975,"Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.
In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.
Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. ""If only something would make a sound!"" he cried.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2976,"The air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them. The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely, ""Where are they, where are they, where are they?""
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.
When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
""Are you shot?"" John whispered tremulously.
""I haven't tried myself out yet,"" Michael whispered back.
We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2977,"I don't know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had planned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure Wendy to her destruction.
Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning ""Follow me, and all will be well.""",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2978,"Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by Peter.
In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.
In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2979,"""I do wish Peter would come back,"" boys said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain.
""I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,"" Slightly said, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, ""but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella.""
They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her. It was only in Peter's absence that they could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by him as silly.
While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was a song.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2980,"The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I do not know why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo'sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.
Later he caught the word Peter.
""Most of all,"" Hook was saying passionately, ""I want their captain, Peter Pan because he cut off my arm."" He brandished the hook threateningly. ""I've waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I'll tear him!""
""And yet,"" said Smee, ""I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.""",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
2981,"""John, John,"" Michael would cry, ""wake up! Where is Nana, John, and mother?""
And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, ""It is true, we did fly.""
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.
""Hullo, Peter,"" they said.
""Hullo,"" replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.
""Is Wendy asleep?"" they asked.
""Yes.""
""John,"" Michael proposed, ""let us wake her and get her to make supper for us,"" but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house. ""Look at them!"" he cried.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

2997,"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.",peter pan part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
2998,"Peter's careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
2999,"But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he woke her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4
3000,"Peter's courage was almost appalling. ""Would you like an adventure now,"" he said to John, ""or would you like to have your tea first?"" Wendy said ""tea first"", and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.",peter pan part 3,2,Intermediate,2
3001,"Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy.",peter pan part 3,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3002,"Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes.
Just when it seemed absolutely finished: ""There's no chimney,"" Peter said; ""we must have a chimney.""
""It certainly does need a chimney,"" said John importantly.
This gave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked out the bottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.",peter pan part 4,2,Intermediate,2
3003,"Peter knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.
What the boys were wondering was, would anyone answer the knock? If a lady, what would she be like?
The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their hats. She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would look.
""Where am I?"" she said.
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in.
""Wendy lady,"" he said, ""for you we built this house.""
""Oh, say you're pleased,"" cried Nibs.
""Lovely, darling house,"" Wendy said, and they were the very words they had hoped she would say.
Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, ""O Wendy lady, be our mother.""",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3004,"""Oh dear!"" Wendy said, ""I will be your mother.""
""Great,"" they all cried and became happy.
""Very well,"" she said, ""I will do my best. Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.""
In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watching outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl.",peter pan part 4,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3005,"One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you let out your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful. Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3006,"After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play.",peter pan part 4,2,Intermediate,2
3007,"There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have desired a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket. But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.",peter pan part 4,2,Intermediate,2
3008,"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could just feel stodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.",peter pan part 4,2,Intermediate,2
3009,"Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.
When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, ""Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!""
Her face beamed when she exclaimed this. You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3010,"Did Wendy think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What disturbed her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother. These things scared her a little.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3011,"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3012,"Peter often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found something; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could find nothing. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3013,"The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was – but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally. Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3014,"That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.",peter pan part 4,2,Intermediate,2
3015,"If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.
The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them.",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3016,"The most haunting time at which to see mermaids is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about everyone being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3017,"It was a day when they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always still been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3018,"The other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting ""Peter, Wendy"" as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.
""They must be swimming back or flying,"" the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault!",peter pan part 4,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3019,"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, ""To bed, to bed,"" in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to everyone, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3020,"One important result of the brush with the pirates on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter Pan had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted something to eat.
""Peter Pan save me, me his velly nice friend.""
She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, ""It is good. Peter Pan has spoken.""",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4
3021,"We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4

3042,"While Wendy sewed, boys played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.
There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it.
""Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the door.""
Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.
""Watch well, braves. I have spoken.""
And then, as so often before, the children dragged him from his tree. As so often before, but never again.
He had brought nuts for the boys.
""Peter, you spoil them, you know,"" Wendy said.
""Ah, old lady,"" said Peter, hanging up his gun.
""It was me told him mothers are called old lady,"" Michael whispered to Curly.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3043,"It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did it.
""Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,"" Wendy said, relenting.
""People of our figure, Wendy!""
""But it is only among our own children.""
""True, true.""
So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.
""Ah, old lady,"" Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, ""there is nothing more pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day's toil is over than to rest by the fire with the little ones nearby.""",peter pan part 5,2,Intermediate,2
3044,"""It is sweet, Peter, isn't it?"" Wendy said, frightfully gratified. ""Peter, I think Curly has your nose.""
""Michael takes after you.""
She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.
""Dear Peter,"" she said, ""with such a large family, of course, I have now passed my best, but you don't want to change me, do you?""
""No, Wendy.""
Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably, blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.
""Peter, what is it?""
""I was just thinking,"" he said, a little scared.
""It is only make-believe, isn't it, that I am their father?""
""Oh yes,"" Wendy said formally and properly.
""You see,"" he continued apologetically, ""it would make me seem so old to be their real father.""",peter pan part 5,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3045,"They sang and danced in their nightgowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never meet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy's good-night story!
And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy's story, the story they loved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he left the room. But tonight he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened.",peter pan part 5,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3046,"""Listen, then,"" said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed. ""There is the stody about a gentleman and a lady. Their names were Mr. Darling, and Mrs. Darling.""
""I knew them,"" John said, to annoy the others.
""I think I knew them,"" said Michael rather doubtfully.
""They were married, you know,"" explained Wendy, ""and what do you think they had?""
""White rats,"" cried Nibs, inspired.
""No.""
""It's awfully puzzling,"" said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.
""Oh dear, oh dear,"" sighed Wendy. ""Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.""
""It's an awfully good story,"" said Nibs.",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3047,"That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that we will be rewarded instead of smacked.
So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.
But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered a hollow groan.
""What is it, Peter?"" she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. ""Where is it, Peter?""",peter pan part 5,2,Intermediate,2
3048,"They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and with a fine candour he told them his own story.
""Long ago,"" he said, ""I thought like you that my mother would always keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.""
I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared them.
""Wendy, let's go home,"" cried John and Michael together.
""Yes,"" she said, clutching them.
""Wendy,"" he said, striding up and down, ""I have asked the redskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.""
""Thank you, Peter.""",peter pan part 5,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3049,"""Tinker Bell will take you, Wendy, across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.""
Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"" she cried.
""You are to get up, Tink,"" Nibs called, ""and take Wendy on a journey.""
Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
""She says she won't!"" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.
""Tink,"" he rapped out, ""if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains"".",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3050,"""Dear ones,"" Wendy said, ""if you will all come with me I feel almost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.""
The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.
""But won't they think us rather a handful?"" Nibs asked in the middle of his jump.
""Oh no,"" said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, ""it will only mean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on first Thursdays.""
""Peter, can we go?"" they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest ones.
""All right,"" Peter replied with a bitter smile.",peter pan part 5,2,Intermediate,2
3051,"""And now, Peter,"" Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, ""I am going to give you your medicine before you go."" She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.
""Get your things, Peter,"" she cried, shaking.
""No,"" he answered, pretending indifference, ""I am not going with you, Wendy.""
""Now then,"" cried Peter, ""no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy""; and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for he had something important to do.",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3052,"Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.
Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.
""Who is that?""
For long there was no answer: then again the knock.
""Who are you?""
No answer.
He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled.
""I won't open unless you speak,"" Peter cried.
Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.
""Let me in, Peter.""
It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her face flushed and her dress stained with mud.",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3053,"What is it?""
""Oh, you could never guess!"" Tink cried, and offered him three guesses. ""Out with it!"" he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.
Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!
""I'll rescue her!"" he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his medicine.
His hand closed on the fatal draught.
""No!"" shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest.
""Why not?""
""It is poisoned.""
""Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?""
""Hook.""",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3054,"He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it to the dregs.
""Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?""
But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.
""What is the matter with you?"" cried Peter, suddenly afraid.
""It was poisoned, Peter,"" she told him softly; ""and now I am going to be dead.""
""O Tink, did you drink it to save me?""
""Yes.""
""But why, Tink?""
Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite.
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies.",peter pan part 5,2,Intermediate,2
3055,"Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.
""Do you believe in fairies?"" he cried.
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.
She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she wasn't sure.
""What do you think?"" she asked Peter.
""If you believe,"" he shouted to them, ""clap your hands; don't let Tink die.""
Many clapped.
The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved.",peter pan part 5,2,Upper-Intermediate,3
3056,"""And now to rescue Wendy!""
The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, belted with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
Peter regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he was an expert.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3057,"Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?""
He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, ""I don't think so,"" as if he wished things had been otherwise. ""Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?""
""I don't think so,"" said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""Nibs, would -- ""
""Stow this gab,"" roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"" he said, addressing John, ""didn't you never want to be a pirate?""
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at math; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.
""I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,"" he said diffidently.
""And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.""
""What do you think, Michael?"" asked John.
""What would you call me if I join?"" Michael demanded.
""Blackbeard Joe.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3058,"Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: ""Hook or me this time."" He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.
On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3059,"Peter's first words tell all.
""Quick Tink,"" he whispered, ""close the window; bar it! That's right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.""
Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, ""It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4
3060,"""She's awfully fond of Wendy,"" he said to himself. He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.
The reason was so simple: ""I'm fond of her too. We can't both have her, lady.""
But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him, knocking.
""Oh, all right,"" he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the window. ""Come on, Tink,"" he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature; ""we don't want any silly mothers""; and he flew away.
Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which of course was more than they deserved.",peter pan part 5,2,Intermediate,2
3061,"When Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.
""Mother!"" Wendy cried.
""That's Wendy,"" she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.
""Mother!""
""That's John,"" she said.
""Mother!"" cried Michael. He knew her now.
""That's Michael,"" she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.

Someone from Liverpool will sound completely different from someone who has lived in London their whole life, but in some ways the language barriers are an exciting challenge, almost as if you're relearning a language you already know. You will also become accustomed to a different way of communicating. When it comes to humor, the British sense of humor is extremely distinct and leans heavily on sarcasm and a deadpan delivery.

Students entering the UK as non-visa nationals, such as those from the USA and other select nations, do not need any sort of prior entry clearance and can simply request entry a Student Visitor Visa upon arrival in a UK airport.

Also, avoid stressing about money. Yes, it can get very expensive in England, or in any country where you aren't familiar with secret ways to save money, but if you spend your entire study abroad converting currencies in your head you may have a minor breakdown.

Nicknamed ""London-by-the-Sea,"" Brighton has been popular with Londoners since the railroads connected the two cities in the 1840s. Being only an hour's train ride away from London makes Brighton a commuter city. It is no wonder that many of London's trends catch on quickly in Brighton.

One of the iconic castles is Tintagel Castle. It is connected with Arthurian Legend. This medieval ruin lies on a rocky outcrop island against the dramatic backdrop of the Cornish coastline in the South West of England. Dating back up to 1,000 years Alnwick Castle in the North of England remains the home of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland to this day.

Located in the South East of England, close to London, Windsor Castle is the oldest and largest inhabited fortress in the world and remains an official residence of British Monarchs.

The car park is often not free, and neither is the bus. Also, the place the buses drop you off might not necessarily be the place you have to get picked up. You can easily get frustrated trying to figure out how to get back to your car.

It's completely silent other than the occasional sound of a townsperson walking or a car driving by. Out in the countryside when you're on a walk, there's no sound but the wind and the sheep. We even see more stars in the night sky than we do back home. We love it, and that's one of the main reasons we keep going back.

We picked it for two reasons. The main reason was that it was a central location for us to stay and visit all the places we wanted to go in the Midlands. Lichfield was no more than an hour by car from everything we had planned to do.

Some might even have a piece of mistletoe hanging under a doorway forcing unsuspecting persons to kiss. All of these greenery traditions come from the UK, where the decorating of a home with these plants was originally a pagan tradition for the winter solstice. Evergreens were thought to keep evil spirits at bay and the presence of the masculine holly with the feminine ivy symbolised fertility. With the nation's conversion to Christianity, the evergreens came to symbolise the eternal life provided by faith in Jesus Christ. The origins for mistletoe also come from pagan culture and references fertility as well, though the exact reasons why have been seemingly lost to time.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4

There are green trees around it, and soft winds. It has all the pleasures of mountain living, and none of the pains. You will eat better fish than you could catch for yourself in streams in the hills. You will have better meat than a hunter brings home from the forest.
A few have discovered this cool spot in the hot summer of New York. You will see these few guests, eating dinner in the hotel restaurant.

And so these few live during the hot season. They enjoy the delights of mountain and seashore. All is brought to them in their Broadway hotel.
This summer a lady came to the hotel giving this name: ""Madame Beaumont."" The name was like a name in the story of a great romance. And Madame Beaumont was the kind of lady the Hotel Lotus loved. She was beautiful and her manner was very fine. Everyone wished to serve her. The other guests believed that as a guest she was perfection.",o'henry part 2,2,Intermediate,2

She was alone as a queen is alone, because of her high position. She rose from bed late in the morning. She was then a sweet, soft person who seemed to shine quietly.
But at dinner she was different. She would wear a beautiful dress. I cannot find words fine enough to tell about it. Always there were red flowers at her shoulder.

He seemed to like this hotel the best of all he had known.
The young man put his name on the list of hotel guests: Harold Farrington. It was a name with a fine sound. And the young man belonged perfectly in the quiet life of the Lotus.

Once we ran away to get married, and my father followed and took me home. I was afraid they were going to fight. But then my father agreed. Fernando went to Italy to make everything ready for me. My father's very proud. Fernando wanted to give me several thousand dollars for new clothes, and my father said no. When Fernando went away, I came to the city. I work in a shop.

These sudden stops of movement will happen in the city. Instead of moving along the street in their usual orderly way, all the wagons and cabs will suddenly be mixed together and stopped.

In the big city of New York, romance and adventure are always waiting. As we walk along the streets, they are watching us. A cab takes us to a strange door, instead of to our own.

Two times, now, Adventure had asked Rudolf to follow. He was ready. He walked slowly back to where the big black man stood. This time as he passed, he received no paper. The papers were offered to some, but not to all who passed. It seemed to Rudolf that the large black face looked coldly at him.",o'henry part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

In the moments that passed then, he could feel the quick breath of true adventure. What might not be behind the wood of that green door! Bad men planning bad acts, or beauty in trouble, or death, or love—anything might be there.
A soft sound was heard, and the door slowly opened. A girl not yet twenty stood there. Her face was very white, and she was very weak. She put out one hand, and started to fall. Rudolf caught her and carried her inside and put her down on a bed.",o'henry part 3,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

This part of the city is called Greenwich Village. And to old Greenwich Village the painters soon came. Here they found rooms they like, with good light and at a low cost.
Sue and Johnsy lived at the top of a building with three floors. One of these young women came from Maine, the other from California. They had met at a restaurant on Eighth Street. There they discovered that they liked the same kind of art, the same kind of food, and the same kind of clothes. So they decided to live and work together.neumonia was not a nice old gentleman.

He got a little money by letting others paint pictures of him. He drank too much. He still talked of his great masterpiece. And he believed that it was his special duty to do everything possible to help Sue and Johnsy.
Sue found him in his dark room, and she knew that he had been drinking. She could smell it. She told him about Johnsy and the leaves on the vine. She said that she was afraid that Johnsy would indeed sail down, down like the leaf. Her hold on the world was growing weaker.",o'henry part 3,2,Upper-Intermediate,3

The people are homeless, yet they have a hundred homes. They go from furnished room to furnished room. The houses of this part of the city have had a thousand people living in them. Therefore each house should have a thousand stories to tell.
One evening a young man appeared, going from one to another of these big old houses, ringing the doorbell. At the twelfth house, he put down the bag he carried. He cleaned the dust from his face. Then he touched the bell. The woman who owned the house came to the door. The young man looked at her. He asked if there was a room that he could have for the night.",o'henry part 3,2,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1

There were places in the walls made, perhaps, to hold flowering plants. If this were true, the plants had died long before this evening. The air was bad; no flowers could have lived in it for long.
""This is the room,"" said the woman in her soft, thick voice. ""It's a nice room. Someone is usually living in it. I had some very nice people in it last summer. They paid on time.

There was a bed and there were two chairs with ragged covers. Between the two windows there was a looking-glass about twelve inches wide. There were pictures on the walls.
The young man sat down in a chair, while the room tried to tell him its history. The words it used were strange, not easy to understand, as if they were words of many distant foreign countries.
Here and there around the room were small objects forgotten by others who had used the room. There were pictures of theater people, something to hold flowers, but nothing valuable.

""I'm riding back to the ranch today,"" he said. It was easy to see that he did not want to go. ""I have to start some cattle on the road to San Antonio tomorrow morning."" ""I'll go with you as far as Dry Lake,"" said Baldy.

The moon was above, peaceful and bright. There were few people passing. He could hear birds high above him.

All the best things in the world could be his—art, pleasure, beautiful women, honor. All the sweeter things in life were waiting for Prince Michael of Valleluna whenever he might choose to take them. But instead he was choosing to sit in torn clothes on a seat in a park.

It was his chief pleasure to help people who were in trouble. But he always gave wisely, after careful thought.
And now, as he looked at the shining face of the great clock, his smile changed. The Prince always thought big thoughts. When he thought of time, he always felt a touch of sadness.

The Prince rose and went to the young man's seat.
""I am a stranger, and I shouldn't speak to you,"" he said. ""But I can see that you are troubled. I am Prince Michael of Valleluna. I do not want people to know who I am.

""Poor fellow!"" he said. He pulled the torn coat together over the Prince's body.

""But that clock is wrong!"" the man said. ""The first time in ten years! My watch is always—"" But he was talking to no one. He turned and saw the young man running toward a house with three lighted windows on the third floor.

""I was looking for someone else,"" he said.
The last thing he saw was her smile.
Outside the door he stopped and looked around the hall. And then he went along the hall to the other end. He came back and went to the floor above, and walked to the far end of that hall. Every door in the house was painted green.

Your little lady has decided that she is not going to get well. Is there something that is troubling her?"" ""She always wanted to go to Italy and paint a picture of the Bay of Naples,"" said Sue.
""Paint! Not paint. Is there anything worth being troubled about? A man?"" ""A man?"" said Sue. ""Is a man worth—No, doctor. There is not a man."" ""It is weakness,"" said the doctor.

""Tuesday evening!"" I exclaimed. ""And this is Thursday morning. Why didn't you go down yesterday?""
""Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson— which is, I am afraid, a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor.

He has always, however, been a prime favorite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him.

At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark and the path ran across the open moor.

'You are close to the King's Pyland training-stables,' said she.
'Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!' he cried. 'I understand that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?' He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket.

'It's business that may put something into your pocket,' said the other. 'You've two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won't be a loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?'

""Excellent, Watson, excellent!"" murmured my companion. ""The importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.
""Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred.

His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in the sporting clubs of London.

""Is it not possible,"" I suggested, ""that the incised wound upon Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?""
""It is more than possible; it is probable,"" said Holmes. ""In that case one of the main points in favor of the accused disappears.""

Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was Colonel Ross; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.
""I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,"" said the Colonel. ""The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.""",the memoirs of sherlock holmes,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.",the memoirs of sherlock holmes,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

""How about Straker's knife?""
""We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.""
""My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.""
""Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favorite. He lies under suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man's hand.""",the memoirs of sherlock holmes,4,Upper-Intermediate,3
3416,"Holmes shook his head. ""A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,"" said he. ""Why should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable-boy?""
""He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.""",the memoirs of sherlock holmes,4,Advanced,4
3417,"Holmes pricked up his ears.
""We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?""
""It is certainly possible.""
""The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.""
""There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?""
""Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favorite.""",the memoirs of sherlock holmes,4,Advanced,4

Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long gray-tiled out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-colored from the fading ferns, stretched away to the skline, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts.

There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.
""Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr. Holmes?"" said Gregory.
""I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?""
""Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is tomorrow.""

""It is what we call a cataract knife,"" said I.
""I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.""
""The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,"" said the Inspector. ""His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room.

""Yes, it was laid across the bush.""
""You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since Monday night.""

""Excellent.""
""In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.""

The animals build webs with their own soft, naturally-made silk. And much like playing the strings of a guitar, a spider can send out vibrations across its web across many different frequencies.

They had seen life, and done deeds, and experienced adventure; but they did not know it.

As he lifted himself on his elbow, he was frightened by a loud noise. There was a caribou looking at him curiously. The animal was not more than 50 feet away, and instantly, into the man's mind came the picture of caribou meat cooking over a fire. From habit, he reached for the empty gun and aimed it. The caribou leaped away and disappeared across the rocks.
The man cursed and threw the empty gun on the ground. He uttered a cry of pain as he started to drag himself to his feet. It was a slow task.

However, he did pause, trying to decide what to do about a bag made from moose skin. It was not large. It could be covered by his two hands. But he knew that it weighed 15 pounds—as much as all the rest of the pack. This worried him. He finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack. He paused again to gaze at the mooseskin bag. He picked it up quickly with a quick glance around him. It was as if he thought the cruel wasteland was trying to steal it. When he rose to his feet, the bag was included in the pack on his back.",stories,4,Intermediate,2
3616,"He started walking to the left, stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries. His ankle had stiffened, but the pain of it was nothing compared with the pain of his stomach. The berries did not help his hunger. Their bitter taste only made his tongue and mouth sore.
He came to a valley where some birds rose from the rocky places. He threw stones at them but could not hit them. He placed his pack on the ground and followed them as a cat advances on a bird. The sharp rocks cut through his trousers. But the hurt was lost in the pain of his hunger. He moved his body through the wet plants, becoming wet and cold in the process. But he did not notice this, so great was his desire for food.",stories,4,Advanced,4
3617,"As the day continued, he came into valleys where game was more plentiful. Twenty or more caribou passed by, within easy shooting distance of a gun. He felt a wild desire to run after them, certain that he could catch them. A small black animal came toward him, carrying a bird in its mouth. The man shouted. It was a fearful cry, but the animal, leaping away in fright, did not drop the bird.
Late in the afternoon he followed a stream which flowed through some thick grass. He grasped these grasses firmly near the root and pulled up what looked like a vegetable. Eagerly he sank his teeth into it. It was tender on the outside and gave the promise of food. But its inside was hard and stringy, and, like the berries, it had no food value.",stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

He looked into every pool of water, searching without success for things to eat. Then, as the night darkened, he discovered a single small fish in one of these pools. He plunged his whole arm in, but the fish escaped his grasp. He reached for it with both hands and stirred the mud at the bottom of the pool. During his excitement he fell in, getting wet as high as his shoulders. Then the water was too cloudy with mud to allow him to see the fish. He was forced to wait until the mud had again settled to the bottom.
Then he tried again, until the water was again filled with mud. But he could not wait.",stories,4,Intermediate,2

The last things he did were to be certain that his matches were dry and to wind his watch. The blankets were wet. His ankle pained him. But he knew only that he was hungry. Through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and of food served in all imaginable manners. When he awakened he was cold and sick. There was no sun. The gray of earth and sky had become deeper. A cold wind was blowing and snow was whitening the hilltops. The air about him grew white with snow while he made a fire and boiled more water. It was wet snow, half rain. At first it melted as soon as it hit the earth. But it continued falling, covering the ground and destroying his fire.",stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

Day came. It was a gray day with no sun. It had ceased raining. The sharpness of his hunger had departed. There was a dull pain in his stomach, but it did not trouble him so much. He was more in control of himself.
He cut the remains of one of his blankets into strips and bound his bleeding feet. He used one of the strips on his swelled ankle and prepared himself for a day of travel. When he was ready to pick up his pack, he paused long before deciding to keep the moose-skin bag, but when he departed, it went with him.",stories,4,Advanced,4

In the evening he caught three more small fish, eating two and saving the third for breakfast. The sun had dried the wet plants and he was able to build a fire. He had not traveled more than ten miles that day. The next day, traveling whenever his heart permitted, he went no more than five miles. But his stomach did not give him any pain. It seemed to be sleeping. There were wolves also. Their howls could be heard across the land, and once he saw three of them crossing his path.",stories,4,Upper-Intermediate,3

That shining sea was the Arctic Ocean. That ship was a fishing boat which had wandered east from the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Now it was lying in Coronation Gulf. He remembered the map he had seen long ago, and it was all clear and reasonable to him.
He sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs. He had worn holes through the blanket wrappings. His gun and knife were both lost. He had also lost his hat somewhere, with the matches in the band. The matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the paper. He looked at his watch. It marked eleven o'clock and was still going.",stories,4,Advanced,4

The days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientists and the ship's officers. He delighted in the sight of so much food and watched it carefully as it went into the mouths of others. With the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of sorrow came into his eyes. He was not mad.
He was afraid that there would not be enough food. He inquired of the cook, the cabin boy, the captain, concerning the food supply. They reassured him numerous times. But he would not believe them and went into the kitchen to see with his own eyes.",stories,4,Intermediate,2

He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and pulled forth his lunch. The action took no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness touched his bare fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but instead, struck the fingers against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat.
He had not had time to take a bite of his lunch. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice around his mouth prevented him.",stories,4,Advanced,4

There was no real bond between the dog and the man. The one was the slave of the other. The dog made no effort to indicate its fears to the man. It was not concerned with the well-being of the man.

He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out of the ground, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he also got many pieces that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked carefully, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him.

3654,"Currently, VAT in the UK is 17.5%, a pretty big chunk of change, especially when you get a $500+ hotel bill. Well, now thanks to the efforts of the UK government to stimulate the economy, the chancellor, Allistair Darling, has cut the VAT from 17.5% to 15%. This means that there is automatically a 2.5% discount on pretty much everything.
With the lowering exchange rates, increased competitiveness on transatlantic airfares and the desperation of business to keep customers during this economic downturn, now is definitely the time to book a trip to London and the rest of the UK. With a cut in VAT, expect taxes and fee on transatlantic flights to go down, along with hotel rates.

The tors are one of its biggest draws, areas of hills topped with outcrops of bedrock that reveal the huge granite deposits (roughly 241 square miles). Its rivers, moors, and forests are also big draws to the park as well as the many markets, walks, and activities provided by the National Trust and other groups. One of the park's most mysterious attractions are the standing stones and hut circles that populate the region, providing a tie to the civilisations that came before.

Perhaps the most famous of Leeds Castle's owners was King Henry VIII who transformed Leeds Castle into a palace for his first wife Catherine of Aragon in 1519, adding amongst other things a maiden tower to house the Queen's Maids of Honour.

Over 700 years before its most famous resident, Sir Winston Churchill, stepped through the door of Chartwell House someone else was calling it home.

Nowadays the winter weather is wet and windy rather than icy and snowy in the south. This is a shame really as the latter certainly makes us feel more festive as we approach Christmas. Our unpredictable weather is due to the moist air from the Atlantic to the south and west mixing with the dry continental air from mainland Europe to the east; with a bit of global warming added in. This means many types of weather can be experienced in a single day.

We often watch the cows grazing in the field opposite the house and it was a fabulous opportunity to meet their offspring. We often ask our neighbours if they can put them in the field opposite more often to complete the quintessentially English view with the cows munching away on the grass in the foreground and the South Downs in the distance. The farmer separates them from their mothers at quite a young age so they can control the amount of milk they drink.

Normally I wouldn't complain, but it's getting to the stage where the rivers and lakes hereabouts are extremely low. The stream in our bottom field by the wood is very low indeed. Also, the stream by the old corn mill is completely dry and what is usually a rushing stream with wild garlic growing in the spring time, is now a gully full of dry leaves.
Generally, we complain about the weather here, but to be honest we could do with a week or so of downpours to restore water levels; at night only though please so we can still enjoy the outdoors in the daytime.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2

You can get there in many different ways across the Solent (the stretch of water between the mainland and the island); by hovercraft, ferry or catamaran. We chose the ferry as we were going in the Land Rover so we could drive all over the island while we were there.

Gradually the green countryside turns into the multi-coloured cityscape; it takes about 50 minutes. Once at Victoria Station, I need to change onto the Underground to get to Piccadilly Circus, so up one stop to Green Park on the Victoria Line, then one stop East on the Piccadilly Line.

The river Ouse, the river Adur and their tributaries are constantly under pressure from pollution and assessing the invertebrate population is an excellent way of knowing the status of a watercourse. He and two colleagues then proceeded to climb down a ladder into the stream, carried out their survey and promised to email me the results.

The birds start singing their hearts out and building nests and the plants and trees go into overdrive. One of the first signs of spring for me is when the swallows come back from their travels to Africa and spend the warmer months in the British Isles. They swoop low over the lake snapping flies out of the air, then go and chatter to each other on the telegraph lines or on the beams in the barns. I recently took a photo of some fledgling swallows I saw doing just this.

The asparagus grows in early to mid-spring, and looks like fingers growing out of the ground. It almost grows while you watch. You can pick it all and then the next day, it's back! We're very lucky to have two asparagus beds which were planted by the previous owners of the farm.

It reminds me a little bit of the traditional opening scene of Downton Abbey; all the bustling preparations by the staff to get the house ready for an event.

Ironically, the guys from London turned up in the cleanest shiniest Land Rover Defender I've seen in a long time, which goes to show they were 'Townies' not country folks like us with our filthy muddy Defender. All were welcome, town or country folk alike, and it was great to meet new people from different places.

There is also Anne of Cleves' house, Henry VIII's rejected fourth wife. In 1540 Henry gave this house to her after their divorce, although Anne never actually lived there.

The Meteorological Office (or what we call the 'Met Office,' which is the UK's official weather monitoring service) called it 'Storm Angus.' It wasn't up to hurricane standards, but wind speeds reached 80 mph and even more on the south coast. Last Easter we had 'Storm Katie' which was much fiercer than Angus and it blew the kids' trampoline away down as far as the vegetable patch; how rude! It narrowly missed taking out one of the greenhouses and the power lines in between; we counted ourselves lucky there.

Each year in early September they hold an annual Harvest Fair with ploughing matches, a local folk band, a barbecue, sheep shearing, local craft stalls and a display of vintage tractors and stationary engines. We have attended the fair for a couple of years now and we enjoy showing our support as well as having the opportunity to see some farming machinery (which our sons love) and meeting friends.
This year we decided to take our tractor to the show, as it's a very fine example, to show it off. Once at the fair, we got chatting to a chap who is writing a book about vintage tractors and he was very enthusiastic about ours.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2

Some of you in colder parts of the world will laugh as I'm sure you experience far colder temperatures than us, but last week here it reached -6 degrees centigrade; if we get any snow this winter (which is unlikely as it rarely snows in the south) the whole country will grind to a halt as we are so unprepared. As a nation, snow tends to take us by surprise, and although we love it, we only love it for a day or two as it gets in the way of our daily lives after that. Last winter we had one morning of light snow, which we made the most of by making a rather small snowman and had a brief snowball fight. The kids are crossing their fingers we'll get some decent snow this time.",notes from an english farm,4,Advanced,4

We have a cup of tea and a snack at Wetherspoon's Pub (called 'The West Quay'), and then we catch the number 7 bus (which is a double-decker) to Old Steine in Brighton town. Here is a picture of the bus, which has the distinctive red and cream livery for Brighton and Hove buses.
Each Brighton bus has a name, which is the name of a notable deceased local person. The one we travelled on was called 'Mother Riccarda', a Brighton nun who saved the lives of more than 60 people from Nazi death camps during the Second World War. Once we've alighted the bus, we usually head for the pier for lunch.",notes from an english farm,4,Advanced,4

There used to be a second pier called the West Pier, but this has been so battered by the sea and outbreaks of fire, it's now a ghostly metal shell cut off from the shore. Here's a photo of the remains of the West Pier which is a bit further along the beach to the west. Brighton also has a lot of history, and you can get a multitude of town tours to experience all the interesting places it has to offer. Old Steine, the bus stop we got off at, is very near to the Royal Pavilion, the Prince Regent's seaside residence. It's very ornately decorated inside in an Indian and Chinese style.",notes from an english farm,4,Advanced,4
3705,"The coming of the month of August means we are now reaping the benefits of our planting in the vegetable patch. We are positively drowning in peas, courgettes, runner beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and raspberries. It's lovely to pick the crop and then be eating it half an hour later; you can't get much fresher than that! It's a great way to get healthy vitamin-packed food into the kids as they love to help pick and prepare it. They also understand where it all comes from rather than just from a supermarket shelf.
The apples in the orchards are growing well too, although it'll still be a month or so before we can pick them to make into cider.
Elsewhere on the farm, Andy is now working on fixing our bridge across the stream at the bottom of the field leading to the woods.",notes from an english farm,4,Intermediate,2

Sometimes I sit in our bedroom and marvel at the many people who must have been born, slept and died in there over the years. The beams have witnessed all these comings and goings, although the spiders are more recent.
We have big plans for this place. When we bought it in 2014 it was obvious to us that it would be a project. Our plan, as well as the management of the land, is to try to restore it in a sympathetically English traditional style, as well as having some modern conveniences. We feel so lucky to live in such a beautiful place and to be the temporary custodians of this farm.",notes from an english farm,4,Advanced,4

We did have some pumpkins and we had great fun with the kids hollowing them out to make spooky lanterns with tea lights in.

Interestingly, 10 years later, 29 percent of these children who had participated had become obese. Even eating meals as a family as infrequently as once or twice a week was found to significantly reduce the chance of children becoming overweight 10 years on, compared to those children who never ate meals as a family during their childhood. The researchers suggest their findings are a result of family meals being more likely to be healthy, children being exposed to a healthy model of eating into adulthood.",family,4,Advanced,4

However, when the sky turns red during a sunset, it means we're further away from the sun.

Hills are actually very tall mountains but whose rocks and rugged peaks have eroded over millions of years by wind, water, cold and other conditions. In other words, they have shrunk. Some hills measure less than five hundred feet and are as flat as a pancake. However, the earth's surface is never fixed. It keeps evolving continually and imperceptibly and new formations are being formed. People tended to inhabit hills with various imaginary creatures such as jolly goblins or laborious gnomes who dig winding tunnels. Nonsense! There are only rocks, rocks and more rocks both inside and outside.",everyday life stories 2,3,Advanced,4
3767,"It's easy to read the time on a watch or an alarm clock. But in ancient times people lived without them. The sun was used to tell the time during the day. As for the night it was Egyptian astronomers who noted that the stars rose in the east and set in the west. They noticed that one of these stars, the North Star, didn't move and other stars rotated around it. They chose it to be a point of reference. They divided up the sky into 36 sequences. When observing the summer sky, Egyptian astronomers noted that only twelve sequences of the sky crossed the North Star. So, they assigned each of these equal sequences one hour, or twelve hours for the whole night. Then they figured that the day would be no different and allocated twelve hours for the daytime as well. A day of 24 hours was born.",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3768,"Most of living species both animals and insects don't live as long as humans do. Some insects last only a day whereas there are animals that can live more than a century. For instance, the world's oldest known turtle died at the age of at least 188. Scientists believe that man's natural life span is 120 years. Along with turtles and elephants, humans are destined to live the longest. The explanation for difference in life expectancy is that for every species the aging process is 'programmed' in advance. However, this process can be disrupted and thus life expectancy is shorten, for example due to a bad habit, malnutrition or a disease. Thanks to advances in medicine, better standard of living, the life expectancy of humans has greatly increased.",everyday life stories 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
3769,"Mistral, Diablo, Willy-Willy, North Wind are just few of the 150 winds that blow on the earth. They were named after the area of origin and their unique characteristics. The Ancients believed in divine interference. When storms and hurricanes occurred, it meant the gods were angry. By contrast, gentle breeze signified a sleeping goddess. It wasn't until the 17th century that Galileo, Pascal and Torricelli discovered that wind was more than a simple draught. The temperature of air depends on the intensity of the sun's rays. Wind comes from cold areas, where the air is heavier, and blows towards warmer areas, where it is lighter. The greater the pressure between cold and warm air currents, the stronger the wind. Wind is invisible we can only feel it or hear it moaning, howling or hissing.",everyday life stories 2,3,Advanced,4
3770,"If you're carsick it's because you're not the one driving it! In a moving car, any passenger's brain processes information it didn't ask for. In our ears we all have internal tiny receptors. They indicate the brain how to position the head. Vibrations, turns and accelerations of a car confuse these receptors and thus the brain. Our eyes can't focus properly because our head is moving around due to the speed at which the car is moving. Finally, the pressure sensors embedded in soles of our feet help us to maintain the balance while we are on the ground. While in the car the ground is in constant motion, so the brain is unable to analyze correctly the surroundings.
Carsickness is the result of unclear information the brain receives from the receptors and sensors in ears, eyes and feet.",everyday life stories 2,3,Upper-Intermediate,3
3771,"One of people's oldest dreams has been to soar through the air, see the sun up close and gain a bird's eye view on the earth beneath us. Yet it's taken century to figure out that it's not enough to attach wings to our back and fly like a bird. When an airplane first accelerates, the air around the plane's wings is divided into two parts, moving at two different speeds. As the wings are slightly curved on top, air is passing over the wing, pushed upwards, and the area of low pressure is created. Meanwhile, the opposite action is taken underneath. Air passing under the wing thrusts downwards, exerting higher pressure on the wing, which creates lift. All this helps push the airplane to sky. In other words, air contains elements of force so that a plane can take off and maintain its altitude.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2

I had an appointment at the dentist's after work, so he said he would give me a hand. It has taken him two hours much longer than it usually takes me. Back home when we started to unpack the bags he suddenly said ""Oh, no! I've forgotten to buy the oil!"" Then, two minutes later, ""Oh, no! You wanted me to get some sugar as well, didn't you? Sorry, I've forgotten."" I asked him, ""Did you get any rice?"" ""You wanted rice?"" he replied. ""Definitely, it was on the shopping list I gave you."" ""Sorry. I left it in the car."" What he had actually bought was six tins of pineapple as they were on special offer, two packs of cheese, the price for them was reduced because of sell- by date, a big jar of chocolate spread, which is his favorite. When I tried to complain he got upset and said that he only had wanted to help me.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2
3773,"I love my husband and don't feel like getting angry with him. The thing is that he wasn't taught when he was a child how to cook, do shopping, do washing-up or ironing. He was growing up with two older sisters and his mum always prevented him from doing any jobs around the house. When I used to go away on business he had to get his mum to look after him and our two children. However, now I am relieved. I know that my son or daughter can care for him while I am away. Especially, I rely on my son who is a new generation of men being able to share with a wife all housework.

3774,"My friend is one of the top thousand richest men in Thailand. You would never say this if you met him in everyday life. He wears casual, not designer clothes and he is quite easy to talk to. I was introduced to him once I was traveling to Thailand where I was making a documentary about the growing number of young, self-made businessmen. He immediately was ready to tell his story, so here it is. He was born into a very poor family with eight more brothers and sisters. The place he grew up was a small village really in the middle of nowhere. It was so rural that he had to walk to school nine kilometers one way. Although he turned only fourteen, he had to go out to work in order to help his dad to support the huge family. He was the oldest boy and in Thailand it's common for children to work at fourteen. To begin with, he sold ice creams in the street, later he got a job selling cloth from door to door around the area. ",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2
3775,"That gave him the idea what kind of products different groups of people wanted and he made his first business contacts. When he was twenty-one he left his wife and two children at home and moved to the capital Bangkok where he set up his own company selling various household appliances and gadgets. It was really hard work as he didn't have money to invest and had to take out a loan from the bank. Thanks to the contacts in high places he managed to get import licenses, which helped him corner the market. The business was
slowly taking off and he could bring his family over to live together. Despite of instability in economics and a drop-in currency value he survived.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2
3776,"It's eight o'clock in the morning and I am next to an outdoor swimming pool in London in which the temperature is five degrees above freezing. There are already few swimmers, doing fiercely one length after another. I had intended to discover, by taking a swim myself, why anyone would like to swim in such cold water. However, in the end, I decided to ask people instead. I'm patiently waiting for the first to come out and when he dries up I dare ask what made him decide to take up cold water swimming. Richard has been a swimmer here for three years, coming every morning before work. ""It's wonderful on the cold winter morning. I thought it would make me healthier and more resistant. In fact, I haven't been ill once since then. Above all, it helps me feel livelier and energetic at work.""",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3777,"Olivia is another frequent swimmer here. She is a young mum of two kids who used to be seriously ill. One alternative doctor recommended her to try to get hardened. He told her that she could thus become fitter and it would help to cope with the illness. She believed the doctor and has been coming for a swim every other day. It took her a month to get used to diving into freezing water. Amazingly, but now she can't do without this habit, it's just as if she misses something. As for her health improvement, she is not completely over she feels much better though. The pool is open even if the temperature drops below zero and the water gets frozen. They break the ice in the middle so that you can swim in circles. I would like to be able to say that I too dived happily into the water and swam a couple of hundred of meters. But the truth is, fearing the worst, I walked very carefully into the pool, stood there almost in shock and then got out again after 30 seconds before I became a block of ice!",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2
3778,"It might sound strange, but I've started thinking recently about the places people arrange to meet. The other day my old friend arranged to meet me outside the tube station in a quite rough area of London. My friend was late as usual since he is never in time. I had to wait for half an hour in the street, watching the police drive by and rain come down. While I was there, two men came up to me and asked for money and a tough guy told me, ""What are you looking at?"" I didn't feel scared but suddenly though, ""What am I doing here? Isn't it a terrible place to meet?"" When I was young, I used to meet at bus stops because I didn't want my parents to see who I was going out with. I didn't meet in a bar as I was afraid to be the first and face the manager asking me my age.",everyday life stories 2,3,Elementary/Pre-Intermediate,1
3779,"Now I don't care sitting in a cafe or somewhere like that on my own. I'd rather look lonely for someone than be outside, getting cold or wet. By contrast, my friend who I was meeting the other day always feels embarrassed while being left by himself in a bar. That's why he asked to meet in the street. When he finally turned up, we had our typical opening conversation. ""Peter. There you are. I've started worrying if you are coming or not."" ""Sorry. The traffic was heavy. I got stuck in a traffic jam."" The excuse can vary, but he never confesses to being absolutely hopeless and killing time on the way here so that he doesn't come before me. I gave up again, ""Oh, well, never mind. I haven't been waiting for you long, I had arrived myself late as well.""

3780,"I grew up in Manchester in the 1950s and my dad supported Manchester City team, so did I. When we were watching together a game, he always used to say, ""You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your football team. It's part of your family history, part of who you are. Supporting a football club is about more than getting together with your pals in a bar to celebrate the victory or heckling a goal, which is added to the winning score. It's about hope and belief! Even when everything is going wrong and your team has just gone down to the Third Division or it's lost a big match against its local rivals, you have to believe that things will get better."" Even though my dad is long ago dead, his words are for me meaningful. I stick to them and never stop supporting the team of my family although it's not known to many football lovers at least as much as another team from my home town Manchester United.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2

Most football fans now know the football club Manchester United. By all means, it's so popular around the world as it has got a highly qualified manager, well paid talented players and they keep winning. Nevertheless, I'm not going to switch to the new club, I love my team and I'll be a faithful supporter of it for the rest of my life.",everyday life stories 2,3,Intermediate,2
