14,"Tom gave the brush to Ben and he painted the fence. And, while the boy who a few moments before had been a riverboat worker and became hot in the sun, Tom sat under the tree, eating the apple and planning how to get more help.
There were enough boys. They came along the street, stopped to laugh, but remained to paint. After Ben, Bill Fisher painted. Then Johnny Miller came. Each one paid to be allowed to work. In the middle of the afternoon, Tom was very rich because he had many playthings.
And he had not worked, and the whole fence had been painted three times. There was no more paint. With more paint, Tom would soon have owned everything belonging to the other boys.
Tom had discovered a great law of human action. A man or a boy will desire something if it is not easy to get.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
16,"Tom hurried to the center of the village. There two armies of boys had met for a battle. Tom was the leader, the General, of one army, and his good friend, Joe Harper, was the General of the other. Tom and Joe did not fight. They sat together and sent their orders to the armies.
When the battle was finished, they agreed to have another battle on another day. Then the armies marched away, and Tom started to go home alone.
As he passed Jeff Thatcher's house, he saw a new girl in the garden. She had blue eyes and yellow hair. She was beautiful. Tom had loved a girl named Amy Lawrence. A week ago she had said that she loved him. He had been happy and proud. But now in a moment she was gone from his heart.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
18,"The sun rose upon a quiet world and looked warmly down upon the peaceful village. The family began the day by praying together.
Then Tom did his Sunday studying. He was trying to learn some words from the Bible. Sid had already finished his studying, but Tom was slow. His mind was busy with other things.
Tom was learning five verses. Some verses are long and some are short. Tom had found five short verses. Aunt Polly's daughter, Mary, helped him, and after a time, he could say the verses without looking at the book.
Mary gave him a knife for studying so well. It was not a good knife, but it was a knife. Tom was deeply delighted.
Then Mary helped him to dress in his Sunday clothes. When they were ready, the three children went to Sunday school.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
19,"The next morning Tom was very sad. This was the beginning of another week of slow suffering in school. He usually began this day wishing that there had been no Saturday and no Sunday. Because of them, school seemed more painful to him.
He lay in bed, thinking. If he were sick, he could stay home. He thought carefully about all parts of his body, but he could discover no sickness.
Then he looked at his foot. His foot had been hurt. He had an idea. He began to cry as if with pain. But Sid, in his bed across the room, continued to sleep. Tom's voice grew louder. Now he seemed to feel real pain in his foot.
Tom started crying and shouting, ""Sid, Sid!"" He tried shaking him. This time, the result was good.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
24,"Tom went to a place, very near, where he kept some of his things.
From this place, he took a long knife made of wood. He tied it to his side. He was not Tom Sawyer now. He dreamed he had become a famous leader named Robin Hood who had lived with his men hundreds of years before, in another forest.
He advanced slowly, moving carefully from behind one tree to another. Believing for the moment that he really was Robin Hood, he said: ""Stay where you are, my men. Do not move until I call."" Now Joe Harper appeared. He, too, had a long wooden knife.
Tom called, ""Stop! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest? No person enters my forest until I say that he may!"" ""I am Guy of Guisborne,"" said Joe Harper, continuing the game.
They took their two long knives, and began a slow, careful fight.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
27,"Tom had decided now. He was sad and without hope. He was a boy with no friends. No person loved him. He had tried to do what was right, but they would not let him. Yes, they were forcing him into a bad life. He could now choose nothing else.
He had come far from the village.
He heard the distant school bell, and he knew that he would never, never hear it again. Tears fell from his eyes.
Here he met his best friend, Joe Harper. Joe's eyes were filled with anger, and it was easy to see that there was a great and sad purpose in his heart.
Tom said that he was going to travel around the world, never to return to the village. He hoped that Joe would not forget him.
And Joe had come to say the same to Tom. They were two souls with only one thought.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
28,"Joe had been beaten by his mother. But he had done nothing. She plainly wished him to go away. Therefore, he was going. He hoped that she would be happy now. He hoped that she would never be sorry about sending her boy into the cold world to suffer and die.
The two boys walked together. They agreed to be like brothers.
They would never separate until they died. They began to plan. They decided to be pirates.
Three miles south of the village, there was an island in the river.
The Mississippi River was a mile wide there. The island was long and not very wide, and it was covered with trees. No people lived on it, and few people lived on the river's shore near the island. It would be a good place for pirates. Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

Happy and hungry, they built their fire. Huck had found some good water to drink. While Joe cooked some meat, Tom and Huck went to the river and caught some fish. Joe cooked these with the meat. No fish had ever tasted so good.
Then Huck smoked. After that, they all started to walk through the trees to see what they could discover.
They found much to delight them, but nothing surprising. The island was almost three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide. It was very near to the shore on one side, but far from the shore where their village was.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

The next morning Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving toward Tom. He had everything that he wanted to eat. There was much more talk than usual. Aunt Polly spoke: ""We can laugh now, Tom. But you were not very kind to let me suffer. You came across the river to surprise us in the church. Why could you not come across the river to tell me that you were not really dead? Tom, some day you will be sorry. You will wish that you had cared more for me. But then it will be too late.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

Then Tom appeared at the door. Becky hurried to close the book. Her hand caught the page, and suddenly, it was in two pieces. Becky began to weep.
""You are bad, Tom Sawyer, to come and watch me! And now you will tell the teacher, and he will beat me, and what shall I do! I have never been beaten in school.

Tom's days were days of joy, but his nights were filled with fear. Indian Joe was in all his dreams. Poor Huck felt the same. His name had not been called in the meetinghouse. Because Indian Joe had run away, Huck's story was not needed. But Huck was afraid that his part in the story might be told. Huck no longer trusted any human being, because Tom had broken their agreement. Sometimes Tom was afraid that Indian Joe would never be caught. Indian Joe had not been found. The slow days passed. With each day Tom became a little less afraid.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

Huck Finn's life had changed. His sufferings were almost too great for him. Mrs. Douglas had taken him to her home. She kept him clean. He must sleep every night in a clean bed. He must eat like a gentleman. He must go to church. He suffered for three weeks, and then the next day he was gone. Early on the third morning Tom Sawyer went to an old building outside the village.

""I want what I am hunting. The man's cub came here,"" said Shere Khan. ""The man cub's parents have run away. Give me the baby.""

Wombat liked to sleep indoors and Kangaroo liked to sleep outdoors. Then one night a terrible storm started. Kangaroo knocked on Wombat's house and called to Wombat to let him come in. But Wombat refused to let him in. Kangaroo picked up a big rock and dropped it through the roof of Wombat's house. The rock landed on Wombat's head and flattened his brow. Wombat grabbed a spear and threw it at Kangaroo. No matter how hard Kangaroo pulled, the spear wouldn't come out, and his tail just stretched longer and longer.

The life of a star spans billions of years. A star is born from clouds of dust. This cloud mass forms a spinning ball that pulls all the material toward the center. It becomes more and more dense as the material comes together. It also becomes extremely hot. Eventually it becomes so hot that the hydrogen gas begins to glow. The glowing gas ball is called a ""protostar"". A protostar becomes a star when it starts a process called fusion. The fusion process releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat and light.

In about 1850 scientists began to use the name Uranus. It takes Uranus 84 of Earth's years to go around the Sun once, so its year is 84 times as long as ours. But the planet takes only about 17 hours to spin on its axis once, so its day is shorter. Unlike other planets, Uranus lies on its side at an odd angle.

1306,"It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for a small pig - Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased.
""Won't he be cold at night?"" asked Fern.
""No,"" said her father. ""You watch and see what he does.""
Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1310,"The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.
Rain upset Wilbur's plans. Wilbur had planned to go out, this day, and dig a new hole in his yard. He had other plans, too. His plans for the day went something like this: Breakfast at six-thirty. Skim milk, crusts, middlings, wheat cakes with drops of maple syrup sticking to them, potato skins, leftover custard pudding with raisins, and bits of Shredded Wheat.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1312,"At six-thirty Wilbur heard the banging of a pail. Lurvy was standing outside in the rain, stirring up breakfast.
""C'mon, pig!"" said Lurvy.
Wilbur did not budge. Lurvy dumped the slops, scraped the pail, and walked away. He noticed that something was wrong with the pig. Wilbur didn't want food, he wanted love. He wanted a friend - someone who would play with him.
Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think there's something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn't touched his food.""
""Give him two spoonfuls of sulphur and a little molasses,"" said Mr. Zuckerman.
Wilbur couldn't believe what was happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1316,"""Salutations!"" said the voice.
Wilbur - the pig jumped to his feet. ""Salu-what?"" he cried.
""Salutations!"" repeated the voice.
""What are they, and where are you?"" screamed Wilbur. ""Please, please, tell me where you are. And what are salutations?""
""Salutations are greetings,"" said the voice. ""When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the doorway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!""
At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1323,"Later on that morning, the animals came up from the pasture - the sheep, the lambs, the gander, the goose, and the seven goslings. There were many complaints about the awful smell, and Wilbur had to tell the story over and over again, of how the Arable boy had tried to capture Charlotte, and how the smell of the broken egg drove him away just in time.
""It was that rotten goose egg that saved Charlotte's life,"" said Wilbur. The goose was proud of her share in the adventure.
""I'm delighted that the egg never hatched,"" she gabbled.
Templeton, of course, was miserable over the loss of his beloved egg. But he couldn't resist boasting.
""It pays to save things,"" he said inhis surly voice. ""A rat never knows when something is going to, come in handy. I never throw anything away.""",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

Everybody knew that the Zuckermans had a wondrous pig. People came from miles around to look at Wilbur and to read the words on Charlotte's web. The news of the wonderful pig spread clear up into the hills, and farmers came rattling down in buggies and buckboards, to stand hour after hour at Wilbur's pen admiring the miraculous animal. All said they had never seen such a pig before in their lives.
When Fern told her mother that Avery had tried to hit the Zuckermans' spider with a stick, Mrs. Arable was so shocked that she sent Avery to bed without any supper, as punishment.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1327,"Next morning, Wilbur-the pig arose and stood beneath the web. He breathed the morning air into his lungs. Drops of dew, catching the sun, made the web stand out clearly. When Lurvy arrived with breakfast, there was the handsome pig, and over him, woven neatly in block letters, was the word TERRIFIC. Another miracle.
Lurvy rushed and called Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Zuckerman rushed and called Mrs. Zuckerman. Mrs. Zuckerman ran to the phone and called the Arables. The Arables climbed into their truck and hurried over. Everybody stood at the pigpen and stared at the web and read the word, over and over, while Wilbur, who really felt terrific, stood quietly swelling out his chest and swinging his snout from side to side.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1329,"Tired from his romp, Wilbur lay down in the clean straw. He closed his eyes. The straw seemed scratchy - not as comfortable as the cow manure, which was always delightfully soft to lie in. So he pushed the straw to one side and stretched out in the manure. Wilbur sighed. It had been a busy day - his first day of being terrific. Dozens of people had visited his yard during the afternoon, and he had had to stand and pose, looking as terrific as he could. Now he was tired. Fern had arrived and seated herself quietly on her stool in the corner.
""Tell me a story, Charlotte!"" said Wilbur, as he lay waiting for sleep to come. ""Tell me a story!""

However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess!

She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry.

Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never be ten again. The gaiety of those romps!

John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.

Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile: ""I do believe it is that Peter again!""

It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep.

But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.

""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?""
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box.

Fortunately she knew at once what to do. ""It must be sewn on,"" she said, just a little patronisingly.
""What's sewn?"" he asked.
""You're dreadfully ignorant.""
""No, I'm not.""
But she was exulting in his ignorance. ""I shall sew it on for you, my little man,"" she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife sewing bag, and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.
""I daresay it will hurt a little,"" she warned him.

""How clever I am!"" he crowed rapturously, ""oh, the cleverness of me!""
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities.
But for the moment Wendy was shocked.

""Oo!""
""And, Wendy, there are mermaids.""
""Mermaids! With tails?""
""Such long tails.""
""Oh,"" cried Wendy, ""to see a mermaid!""
He had become frightfully cunning. ""Wendy,"" he said, ""how we should all respect you.""

Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.
""Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,"" he said, ""and let go.""
They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.

Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.
""I say,"" cried John, ""why shouldn't we all go out?""
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.

Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.
He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share.

Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.
""They don't want us to land,"" he explained.
""Who are they?"" Wendy whispered, shuddering.
But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2

Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.
When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
""Are you shot?"" John whispered tremulously.
""I haven't tried myself out yet,"" Michael whispered back.

When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, ""Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!""

Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally. Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2

She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2

The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always still been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3019,"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, ""To bed, to bed,"" in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to everyone, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2

The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2

Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"" she cried.
""You are to get up, Tink,"" Nibs called, ""and take Wendy on a journey.""
Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
""She says she won't!"" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.
""Tink,"" he rapped out, ""if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains"".",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3056,"""And now to rescue Wendy!""
The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, belted with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
Peter regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he was an expert.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

""I don't think so,"" said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""Nibs, would -- ""
""Stow this gab,"" roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"" he said, addressing John, ""didn't you never want to be a pirate?""
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at math; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.
""I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,"" he said diffidently.
""And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.""
""What do you think, Michael?"" asked John.

Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: ""Hook or me this time."" He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.
On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

""Quick Tink,"" he whispered, ""close the window; bar it! That's right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.""
Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, ""It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

3162,"Depending on who you talk to, Father Christmas in the UK can be seen as a very different figure from Santa Claus. Father Christmas began as a symbol of the holiday following the English Civil War. The Puritan government outlawed the celebration of Christmas as ""papist"" and so Royalist supporters often distributed flyers depicting him as a symbol of the banned Christmas traditions. Following the Restoration, the symbol of Father Christmas was kept alive in mummers' plays and, in the Victorian era; Father Christmas began to take on some of the attributes of his American cousin thanks to ""Twas the Night Before Christmas."" Whereas the character has primarily been a representation of feasting and merriment, he also took on the role of gift-giver and friend to children.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

Each part of the Christingle has symbolism: the orange represents the world, a lit candle stands for Jesus as ""the light of the world"", the red ribbon is the blood of Christ, four dried fruits on cocktail sticks stand in for the fruits of the world or the four seasons, and aluminum foil symbolises the nails that fixed Christ to the cross. Even though the tradition began in Germany, it consisted mainly of the candle and the ribbon, and the other elements were added later on in Britain. The Christingle is largely used in churches as a means of teaching children the symbolism behind Christmas.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

Some might even have a piece of mistletoe hanging under a doorway forcing unsuspecting persons to kiss. All of these greenery traditions come from the UK, where the decorating of a home with these plants was originally a pagan tradition for the winter solstice. Evergreens were thought to keep evil spirits at bay and the presence of the masculine holly with the feminine ivy symbolised fertility. With the nation's conversion to Christianity, the evergreens came to symbolise the eternal life provided by faith in Jesus Christ. The origins for mistletoe also come from pagan culture and references fertility as well, though the exact reasons why have been seemingly lost to time.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night helped to cement the importance of the day in the British culture.

It may be one of the most recognizable patriotic songs in the world, but it has been sadly neglected by many native Brits. According to a study performed by the Sun, 37% of Brits don't know the first line of ""God Save the Queen."" You would think that a song this well-known would have an obvious origin, but strangely enough we don't know who wrote the words. Some attribute authorship to John Bull, others to Thomas Ravenscroft or Henry Purcell.
The phrase ""God Save the King"" dates back as far as a coronation anthem used for King Edgar in 973.
