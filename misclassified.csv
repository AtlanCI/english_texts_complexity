14,"Tom gave the brush to Ben and he painted the fence. And, while the boy who a few moments before had been a riverboat worker and became hot in the sun, Tom sat under the tree, eating the apple and planning how to get more help.
There were enough boys. They came along the street, stopped to laugh, but remained to paint. After Ben, Bill Fisher painted. Then Johnny Miller came. Each one paid to be allowed to work. In the middle of the afternoon, Tom was very rich because he had many playthings.
And he had not worked, and the whole fence had been painted three times. There was no more paint. With more paint, Tom would soon have owned everything belonging to the other boys.
Tom had discovered a great law of human action. A man or a boy will desire something if it is not easy to get.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
16,"Tom hurried to the center of the village. There two armies of boys had met for a battle. Tom was the leader, the General, of one army, and his good friend, Joe Harper, was the General of the other. Tom and Joe did not fight. They sat together and sent their orders to the armies.
When the battle was finished, they agreed to have another battle on another day. Then the armies marched away, and Tom started to go home alone.
As he passed Jeff Thatcher's house, he saw a new girl in the garden. She had blue eyes and yellow hair. She was beautiful. Tom had loved a girl named Amy Lawrence. A week ago she had said that she loved him. He had been happy and proud. But now in a moment she was gone from his heart.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
18,"The sun rose upon a quiet world and looked warmly down upon the peaceful village. The family began the day by praying together.
Then Tom did his Sunday studying. He was trying to learn some words from the Bible. Sid had already finished his studying, but Tom was slow. His mind was busy with other things.
Tom was learning five verses. Some verses are long and some are short. Tom had found five short verses. Aunt Polly's daughter, Mary, helped him, and after a time, he could say the verses without looking at the book.
Mary gave him a knife for studying so well. It was not a good knife, but it was a knife. Tom was deeply delighted.
Then Mary helped him to dress in his Sunday clothes. When they were ready, the three children went to Sunday school.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
19,"The next morning Tom was very sad. This was the beginning of another week of slow suffering in school. He usually began this day wishing that there had been no Saturday and no Sunday. Because of them, school seemed more painful to him.
He lay in bed, thinking. If he were sick, he could stay home. He thought carefully about all parts of his body, but he could discover no sickness.
Then he looked at his foot. His foot had been hurt. He had an idea. He began to cry as if with pain. But Sid, in his bed across the room, continued to sleep. Tom's voice grew louder. Now he seemed to feel real pain in his foot.
Tom started crying and shouting, ""Sid, Sid!"" He tried shaking him. This time, the result was good.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
24,"Tom went to a place, very near, where he kept some of his things.
From this place, he took a long knife made of wood. He tied it to his side. He was not Tom Sawyer now. He dreamed he had become a famous leader named Robin Hood who had lived with his men hundreds of years before, in another forest.
He advanced slowly, moving carefully from behind one tree to another. Believing for the moment that he really was Robin Hood, he said: ""Stay where you are, my men. Do not move until I call."" Now Joe Harper appeared. He, too, had a long wooden knife.
Tom called, ""Stop! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest? No person enters my forest until I say that he may!"" ""I am Guy of Guisborne,"" said Joe Harper, continuing the game.
They took their two long knives, and began a slow, careful fight.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
27,"Tom had decided now. He was sad and without hope. He was a boy with no friends. No person loved him. He had tried to do what was right, but they would not let him. Yes, they were forcing him into a bad life. He could now choose nothing else.
He had come far from the village.
He heard the distant school bell, and he knew that he would never, never hear it again. Tears fell from his eyes.
Here he met his best friend, Joe Harper. Joe's eyes were filled with anger, and it was easy to see that there was a great and sad purpose in his heart.
Tom said that he was going to travel around the world, never to return to the village. He hoped that Joe would not forget him.
And Joe had come to say the same to Tom. They were two souls with only one thought.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
28,"Joe had been beaten by his mother. But he had done nothing. She plainly wished him to go away. Therefore, he was going. He hoped that she would be happy now. He hoped that she would never be sorry about sending her boy into the cold world to suffer and die.
The two boys walked together. They agreed to be like brothers.
They would never separate until they died. They began to plan. They decided to be pirates.
Three miles south of the village, there was an island in the river.
The Mississippi River was a mile wide there. The island was long and not very wide, and it was covered with trees. No people lived on it, and few people lived on the river's shore near the island. It would be a good place for pirates. Then they met Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 1,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

50,"Joe, Tom and Finn met again. Harper had brought meat, and Finn had some tobacco. Tom said that they must also have fire. They went to a large riverboat that was near, and they took some of the fire burning there. They knew that there were no men on the boat. The boatmen were all in the village. But the boys moved very quietly and carefully. Pirates must be pirates.
With Tom as captain of their ship, they left the shore and went into the middle of the river. From here they let the moving river carry them along. They passed the distant village. Two or three lights showed where it was, peacefully sleeping. Tom stood in the boat looking for the last time at the scene of his early joys and later sufferings. He wished that his aunt could see him now, facing the fearful future with a smile on his lips.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
52,"Tom called to the other pirates. Within a few moments they were all playing in the river near the shore. Their boat had been carried away, but this pleased them. They were certain now that they would never return to their village.
Happy and hungry, they built their fire. Huck had found some good water to drink. While Joe cooked some meat, Tom and Huck went to the river and caught some fish. Joe cooked these with the meat. No fish had ever tasted so good.
Then Huck smoked. After that, they all started to walk through the trees to see what they could discover.
They found much to delight them, but nothing surprising. The island was almost three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide. It was very near to the shore on one side, but far from the shore where their village was.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
59,"The little church was filled with people. After a long time Aunt Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary and by the Harper family. All were wearing black clothes. The other people in the church stood up. They remained standing while the two families walked to the front of the church and sat down.
It was quiet again. All prayed, and then a song followed. Now the church leader began to talk of the boys. He told how good they had been. People were sorry to remember that they had not seen the truth earlier when they had thought that these boys were bad. Tears were falling from all eyes.
The sound of the church door, opening slowly, was heard. People rose and watched while the three dead boys walked to the front of the church. Tom was first, Joe next, and last came Huck.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
60,"Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers put their arms around Tom and Joe. Huck stood alone, not knowing what to do. He started to move away, but Tom stopped him and said: ""Aunt Polly, this is not right. Some person must be glad to see Huck."" ""And some person shall be. I am glad to see him, dear boy!"" She put her arms around him also. And now Huck felt more strange than before.
""Sing! And sing your best!"" cried the church leader.
And all the people did sing. There had never been such singing in that church. Tom Sawyer, the Pirate, knew that no moment in his life could be prouder than this.
That was Tom's great plan to return home with the other pirates and go to the church to hear people pray for their souls.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
61,"Boys had returned across the river in the darkness the night before, and had stayed in the forest until nearly daylight. They had entered the church and finished their sleep there before the people came. Then they appeared at the most important moment.
The next morning Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving toward Tom. He had everything that he wanted to eat. There was much more talk than usual. Aunt Polly spoke: ""We can laugh now, Tom. But you were not very kind to let me suffer. You came across the river to surprise us in the church. Why could you not come across the river to tell me that you were not really dead? Tom, some day you will be sorry. You will wish that you had cared more for me. But then it will be too late.""",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
62,"Tom walked slowly and proudly, feeling that all eyes were watch­ing him. Smaller boys followed him, proud to be seen with him. Boys of his own size tried not to show that they knew he had been away. But they did know. They wished that they had sun-browned skin like his. They wished that they were as famous.
Tom decided that he no longer was interested in Becky Thatcher. Being famous was enough pleasure for him. When Becky arrived at school, Tom seemed not to see her. But he saw her playing with other boys and girls. He saw that she often came near him and looked at him.
And he began talking to Amy Lawrence. Becky tried to go away from him, but her feet would not do as she wished. They carried her near to the group around Tom.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
65,"The teacher had a book that he was studying. Every day he would read some pages when he was not busy. Every boy and girl in the school wondered about this book, but none had ever seen its pages. Now, as Becky passed the teacher's table, she saw the book. She opened it and began to look at it.
Then Tom appeared at the door. Becky hurried to close the book. Her hand caught the page, and suddenly, it was in two pieces. Becky began to weep.
""You are bad, Tom Sawyer, to come and watch me! And now you will tell the teacher, and he will beat me, and what shall I do! I have never been beaten in school. But I know what is going to happen to you. You wait and you will see!"" Then, weeping, she ran outside.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
66,"The boys and girls were all busy with their books. The teacher opened his book. Tom looked at Becky. He had seen small and hunted animals in the forest. Now Becky seemed like one of them. He wished that he could help her. Becky destroyed that page. But what could he do?
The next moment the teacher stood before the school. Every eye turned away from his. All the boys and girls were afraid of him. He asked everyone about his book, but every girl and boy denied anything.
Then the teacher asked: ""Rebecca Thatcher, look at me! Did you do this to my book?"" Tom jumped to his feet and shouted, ""I did it!"" All looked at him. They could not believe what they had heard.
Tom stepped forward to take his beating. The surprise, the love shining from Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred beatings.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
67,"Summer had come for several months there would be no school. Tom discovered that the days were too long. He did not have enough to do.
He decided to make a record of everything that happened. But nothing happened during three days. He decided that a record would be of no value.
Becky Thatcher had gone away. During the summer she was living in another town with her father and her mother.
The thought of the fearful killing in the graveyard was always in Tom's mind. It was like a pain. It would not go away.
Then Tom became sick.
For two long weeks Tom remained in bed without knowing what was happening in the village. He was very ill. He was interested in nothing. Then he seemed to be better. But after a day he was ill again. He was in bed for three more weeks.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
68,"Tom was famous once again. The old people loved him and the young people wished that they were like him. His name appeared in the village newspaper. There were people who believed that he might some day become President of the United States if he escaped hanging.
Tom's days were days of joy, but his nights were filled with fear. Indian Joe was in all his dreams. Poor Huck felt the same. His name had not been called in the meetinghouse. Because Indian Joe had run away, Huck's story was not needed. But Huck was afraid that his part in the story might be told. Huck no longer trusted any human being, because Tom had broken their agreement. Sometimes Tom was afraid that Indian Joe would never be caught. Indian Joe had not been found. The slow days passed. With each day Tom became a little less afraid.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
69,"Judge Thatcher had a good opinion of Tom. He said that only a very wise boy could have brought Becky out of the cave safely. He expected Tom to become a great man.
Huck Finn's life had changed. His sufferings were almost too great for him. Mrs. Douglas had taken him to her home. She kept him clean. He must sleep every night in a clean bed. He must eat like a gentleman. He must go to church. He suffered for three weeks, and then the next day he was gone. Early on the third morning Tom Sawyer went to an old building outside the village. He found Huck. Huck had been sleeping behind the building. He was covered with dust. His hair was wild. He was wearing his old clothes. But Tom persuaded Huck to come back to Mrs. Douglas and to be a gentlemen.",the adventures of tom sawyer part 2,1,Advanced,4,3

After many more days and nights, they arrived in Dawson. Now the dogs were very tired. They were very thin, and they wanted a long rest.
But they only had two days' rest, and then they had to start again. The dogs couldn't run fast, and the men weren't happy.

But the dogs had no work, so Buck started to take long walks in the woods. He didn't understand this new place, but he felt very happy. He started to feel something strange inside, and sometimes he could hear something. It called to him.
One night, he woke up suddenly. He could hear the call loudly, and it came from the woods. It was a long, sad howl and it didn't come from a dog. Buck jumped up and ran through the camp into the woods.",the call of the wild,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2

In the camp, Buck sat and watched the river. He listened to the songs of the birds, and he slowly got stronger and stronger. They all got stronger—Buck, Thornton, and his other dogs, Nig and Skeet—and they waited for Thornton's friends. Skeet was a small, friendly dog, and she was a little doctor to Buck.

""Out to the hoghouse,"" replied Mrs. Arable. ""Some pigs were born last night.""
""I don't see why he needs an ax,"" continued Fern, who was only eight.
""Well,"" said her mother, ""one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it.""
""Do away with it?"" shrieked Fern. ""You mean kill it? Just because it's smaller than the others?""
Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. ""Don't yell, Fern!"" she said. ""Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway.""

Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.
""Fern,"" said Mr. Arable, ""I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!""
""But it's unfair,"" cried Fern. ""The pig couldn't help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?""

""Put it on her chair!"" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel.
Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was a scratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one.

Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. ""Give him his breakfast!"" she said.
A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig had a good appetite and caught on quickly.

""Won't he be cold at night?"" asked Fern.
""No,"" said her father. ""You watch and see what he does.""
Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

""There's never anything to do around here,"" he thought. He walked slowly to his food trough and sniffed to see if anything had been overlooked at lunch. He found a small strip of potato skin and ate it. His back itched, so he leaned against the fence and rubbed against the boards.
When he tired of this, he walked indoors, climbed to the top of the manure pile, and sat down. He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of lying down. ""I'm less than two months old and I'm tired of living,"" he said. He walked out to the yard again.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.
Rain upset Wilbur's plans. Wilbur had planned to go out, this day, and dig a new hole in his yard. He had other plans, too. His plans for the day went something like this: Breakfast at six-thirty. Skim milk, crusts, middlings, wheat cakes with drops of maple syrup sticking to them, potato skins, leftover custard pudding with raisins, and bits of Shredded Wheat.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

""C'mon, pig!"" said Lurvy.
Wilbur did not budge. Lurvy dumped the slops, scraped the pail, and walked away. He noticed that something was wrong with the pig. Wilbur didn't want food, he wanted love. He wanted a friend - someone who would play with him.
Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr. Zuckerman.
""I think there's something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn't touched his food.""
""Give him two spoonfuls of sulphur and a little molasses,"" said Mr. Zuckerman.
Wilbur couldn't believe what was happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

Wilbur - the pig jumped to his feet. ""Salu-what?"" he cried.
""Salutations!"" repeated the voice.
""What are they, and where are you?"" screamed Wilbur. ""Please, please, tell me where you are. And what are salutations?""
""Salutations are greetings,"" said the voice. ""When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the doorway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!""
At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop.",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1318,"Wilbur-the pig lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired from his wakeful night and from the excitement of meeting someone for the first time. A breeze brought him the smell of clover - the sweet-smelling world beyond his fence. ""Well,"" he thought, ""I've got a new friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is!
Charlotte is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty - everything I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even though she is pretty and, of course, clever?""
Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears that often go with finding a new friend. In good time he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte. Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior, she had a kind heart, and she was to prove loyal and true to the very end.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1323,"Later on that morning, the animals came up from the pasture - the sheep, the lambs, the gander, the goose, and the seven goslings. There were many complaints about the awful smell, and Wilbur had to tell the story over and over again, of how the Arable boy had tried to capture Charlotte, and how the smell of the broken egg drove him away just in time.
""It was that rotten goose egg that saved Charlotte's life,"" said Wilbur. The goose was proud of her share in the adventure.
""I'm delighted that the egg never hatched,"" she gabbled.
Templeton, of course, was miserable over the loss of his beloved egg. But he couldn't resist boasting.
""It pays to save things,"" he said inhis surly voice. ""A rat never knows when something is going to, come in handy. I never throw anything away.""",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

Everybody knew that the Zuckermans had a wondrous pig. People came from miles around to look at Wilbur and to read the words on Charlotte's web. The news of the wonderful pig spread clear up into the hills, and farmers came rattling down in buggies and buckboards, to stand hour after hour at Wilbur's pen admiring the miraculous animal. All said they had never seen such a pig before in their lives.
When Fern told her mother that Avery had tried to hit the Zuckermans' spider with a stick, Mrs. Arable was so shocked that she sent Avery to bed without any supper, as punishment.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3

When Lurvy arrived with breakfast, there was the handsome pig, and over him, woven neatly in block letters, was the word TERRIFIC. Another miracle.
Lurvy rushed and called Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Zuckerman rushed and called Mrs. Zuckerman. Mrs. Zuckerman ran to the phone and called the Arables. The Arables climbed into their truck and hurried over. Everybody stood at the pigpen and stared at the web and read the word, over and over, while Wilbur, who really felt terrific, stood quietly swelling out his chest and swinging his snout from side to side.",charlotte's web,1,Advanced,4,3
1328,"The news spread. People who had journeyed to see Wilbur when he was ""some pig"" came back again to see him now that he was ""terrific.""
That afternoon, when Mr. Zuckerman went to milk the cows and clean out the tie-ups, he was still thinking about what a wondrous pig he owned.
""Lurvy! "" he called. ""There is to be no more cow manure thrown down into that pigpen. I have a terrific pig. I want that pig to have clean, bright straw every day for his bedding. Understand?""
""Yes, sir,"" said Lurvy.
""Furthermore,"" said Mr. Zuckerman, ""I want you to start building a crate for Wilbur. I have decided to take the pig to the County Fair on September sixth. Make the crate large and paint it green with gold letters!""",charlotte's web,1,Upper-Intermediate,3,2
1329,"Tired from his romp, Wilbur lay down in the clean straw. He closed his eyes. The straw seemed scratchy - not as comfortable as the cow manure, which was always delightfully soft to lie in. So he pushed the straw to one side and stretched out in the manure. Wilbur sighed. It had been a busy day - his first day of being terrific. Dozens of people had visited his yard during the afternoon, and he had had to stand and pose, looking as terrific as he could. Now he was tired. Fern had arrived and seated herself quietly on her stool in the corner.
""Tell me a story, Charlotte!"" said Wilbur, as he lay waiting for sleep to come. ""Tell me a story!""

Wendy came first, then John, then Michael. There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.

It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep. All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2896,"While Mrs. Darling slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.
But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.
The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2903,"The way Mr. Darling won his wife was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2

2916,"They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's bath and carrying him to it on her back.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2

2921,"John was saying: ""I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,"" in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion. Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.",peter pan part 1,2,Advanced,4,2
2926,"""Tinker Bell,"" Peter called softly, after making sure that the children were asleep, ""Tink, where are you?"" She was in a jug for the moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
""Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?""
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss happence to the crowd. In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2929,"Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was frightfully sorry for Peter. ""How awful!"" she said, but she could not help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap. How exactly like a boy!
Fortunately she knew at once what to do. ""It must be sewn on,"" she said, just a little patronisingly.
""What's sewn?"" he asked.
""You're dreadfully ignorant.""
""No, I'm not.""
But she was exulting in his ignorance. ""I shall sew it on for you, my little man,"" she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her housewife sewing bag, and sewed the shadow on to Peter's foot.
""I daresay it will hurt a little,"" she warned him.
""Oh, I shan't cry,"" said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he had never cried in his life.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2930,"Peter clenched his teeth and did not cry while Wendy was sewing it on, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little creased.
""Perhaps I should have ironed it,"" Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself.
""How clever I am!"" he crowed rapturously, ""oh, the cleverness of me!""
It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his most fascinating qualities.
But for the moment Wendy was shocked.
""You conceit braggart,"" she exclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; ""of course I did nothing!""
""You did a little,"" Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2936,"""Oh, how lovely to fly.""
""I'll teach you how to jump on the wind's back, and then away we go.""
""Oo!"" she exclaimed rapturously.
""Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.""
""Oo!""
""And, Wendy, there are mermaids.""
""Mermaids! With tails?""
""Such long tails.""
""Oh,"" cried Wendy, ""to see a mermaid!""
He had become frightfully cunning. ""Wendy,"" he said, ""how we should all respect you.""
She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to remain on the nursery floor.
But he had no pity for her.
""Wendy,"" he said, the sly one, ""you could tuck us in at night.""
""None of us has ever been tucked in at night. And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has any pockets.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2938,"""Out with the light! Hide! Quick!"" cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.
Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.
""There, you suspicious brute,"" she said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace. ""Everyone of the little angels sound asleep in bed.""",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2941,"""I've got it now, Wendy!"" cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.
Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.
""Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,"" he said, ""and let go.""
They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.
""I flewed!"" he screamed while still in mid-air.
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.",peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2

2961,They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I'm captain.,peter pan part 2,2,Advanced,4,2
2962,"Children were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy's word.
""I say,"" cried John, ""why shouldn't we all go out?""
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles. But Wendy hesitated.
""Mermaids!"" said Peter again.
""And there are pirates.""
""Pirates,"" cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, ""let us go at once.""
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2968,"Indeed children were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.
Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.
He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2971,"Peter's careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.
""They don't want us to land,"" he explained.
""Who are they?"" Wendy whispered, shuddering.
But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front. Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2975,"Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.
In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.
Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. ""If only something would make a sound!"" he cried.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2
2976,"The air was rent by the most tremendous crash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them. The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry savagely, ""Where are they, where are they, where are they?""
Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of make-believe and the same island come true.
When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
""Are you shot?"" John whispered tremulously.
""I haven't tried myself out yet,"" Michael whispered back.
We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the wind of the shot far out to sea.",peter pan part 3,2,Advanced,4,2

3009,"Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.
When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, ""Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!""
Her face beamed when she exclaimed this. You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3011,"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3013,"The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was – but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally. Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3016,"The most haunting time at which to see mermaids is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about everyone being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3017,"It was a day when they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always still been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly. It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come. No, worse than that.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3019,"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, ""To bed, to bed,"" in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to everyone, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3020,"One important result of the brush with the pirates on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter Pan had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted something to eat.
""Peter Pan save me, me his velly nice friend.""
She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and he would answer condescendingly, ""It is good. Peter Pan has spoken.""",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2
3021,"We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.",peter pan part 4,2,Advanced,4,2

3042,"While Wendy sewed, boys played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.
There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize it.
""Children, I hear your father's step. He likes you to meet him at the door.""
Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.
""Watch well, braves. I have spoken.""
And then, as so often before, the children dragged him from his tree. As so often before, but never again.
He had brought nuts for the boys.
""Peter, you spoil them, you know,"" Wendy said.
""Ah, old lady,"" said Peter, hanging up his gun.
""It was me told him mothers are called old lady,"" Michael whispered to Curly.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3046,"""Listen, then,"" said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed. ""There is the stody about a gentleman and a lady. Their names were Mr. Darling, and Mrs. Darling.""
""I knew them,"" John said, to annoy the others.
""I think I knew them,"" said Michael rather doubtfully.
""They were married, you know,"" explained Wendy, ""and what do you think they had?""
""White rats,"" cried Nibs, inspired.
""No.""
""It's awfully puzzling,"" said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.
""Oh dear, oh dear,"" sighed Wendy. ""Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.""
""It's an awfully good story,"" said Nibs.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3049,"""Tinker Bell will take you, Wendy, across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.""
Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been sitting up in bed listening for some time.
""Who are you? How dare you? Go away,"" she cried.
""You are to get up, Tink,"" Nibs called, ""and take Wendy on a journey.""
Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
""She says she won't!"" Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady's chamber.
""Tink,"" he rapped out, ""if you don't get up and dress at once I will open the curtains"".",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3053,"What is it?""
""Oh, you could never guess!"" Tink cried, and offered him three guesses. ""Out with it!"" he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.
Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!
""I'll rescue her!"" he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his medicine.
His hand closed on the fatal draught.
""No!"" shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest.
""Why not?""
""It is poisoned.""
""Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?""
""Hook.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3055,"Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.
""Do you believe in fairies?"" he cried.
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.
She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she wasn't sure.
""What do you think?"" she asked Peter.
""If you believe,"" he shouted to them, ""clap your hands; don't let Tink die.""
Many clapped.
The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3056,"""And now to rescue Wendy!""
The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, belted with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
Peter regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he was an expert.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3057,"Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Slightly?""
He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, ""I don't think so,"" as if he wished things had been otherwise. ""Would your mother like you to be a pirate, Twin?""
""I don't think so,"" said the first twin, as clever as the others. ""Nibs, would -- ""
""Stow this gab,"" roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. ""You, boy,"" he said, addressing John, ""didn't you never want to be a pirate?""
Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at math; and he was struck by Hook's picking him out.
""I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,"" he said diffidently.
""And a good name too. We'll call you that here, bully, if you join.""
""What do you think, Michael?"" asked John.
""What would you call me if I join?"" Michael demanded.
""Blackbeard Joe.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3058,"Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: ""Hook or me this time."" He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.
On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2
3059,"Peter's first words tell all.
""Quick Tink,"" he whispered, ""close the window; bar it! That's right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.""
Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, ""It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was.""",peter pan part 5,2,Advanced,4,2

3162,"Depending on who you talk to, Father Christmas in the UK can be seen as a very different figure from Santa Claus. Father Christmas began as a symbol of the holiday following the English Civil War. The Puritan government outlawed the celebration of Christmas as ""papist"" and so Royalist supporters often distributed flyers depicting him as a symbol of the banned Christmas traditions. Following the Restoration, the symbol of Father Christmas was kept alive in mummers' plays and, in the Victorian era; Father Christmas began to take on some of the attributes of his American cousin thanks to ""Twas the Night Before Christmas."" Whereas the character has primarily been a representation of feasting and merriment, he also took on the role of gift-giver and friend to children.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2
3164,"This Christmas symbol is constructed out of fruit, and even its name has meaning, with ""Christingle"" meaning ""Christ's Light"" and representing Jesus's role as ""the light of the world."" Each part of the Christingle has symbolism: the orange represents the world, a lit candle stands for Jesus as ""the light of the world"", the red ribbon is the blood of Christ, four dried fruits on cocktail sticks stand in for the fruits of the world or the four seasons, and aluminum foil symbolises the nails that fixed Christ to the cross. Even though the tradition began in Germany, it consisted mainly of the candle and the ribbon, and the other elements were added later on in Britain. The Christingle is largely used in churches as a means of teaching children the symbolism behind Christmas.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

The car's unique front wheel drive layout allowed for 80% of the internal space of the car to be used for passengers, which explains how four people could fit relatively comfortably in a small space.
An original Mini could be bought for around $1000 in today's money. A Mini these days costs substantially more! The legacy of the Mini endures.

This original version of the band, formed by Marc Bolan, broke up, at which time Bolan gave it another go in 1967. The band shortened its name and switched from acoustic to electric guitars in 1970, and when Chelita Secunda put some glitter under his eyes for an appearance on Top of the Pops, glam rock was born. The band's increasing success was met with worsening behaviour from Bolan, and the band ultimately broke up in 1977 after Bolan's girlfriend wrecked his car with him in it, resulting in his death. The band made several attempts to carry on, but never achieved the same success.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

The first route was from Paddington station to the Bank of England at a fare of one shilling. Since this is almost £40 today, the stop at the bank was probably necessary. He borrowed the name for his service from the French too, which became contracted to 'bus' quite quickly. Other similar services followed, and in 1855 a joint Anglo French company bought out almost all the services and formed a monopoly. By the early 20th century, the company was operating a mixed fleet of horse-drawn and motorised buses. In 1912 it was bought out by the operators of the London Underground and the joint business soon became known as London Transport.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

The first standard design was released in 1921, called prosaically Kiosk no.1, or K1. It was made of three concrete sections, with a wooden door and glass panels in the door and side pieces.

Some might even have a piece of mistletoe hanging under a doorway forcing unsuspecting persons to kiss. All of these greenery traditions come from the UK, where the decorating of a home with these plants was originally a pagan tradition for the winter solstice. Evergreens were thought to keep evil spirits at bay and the presence of the masculine holly with the feminine ivy symbolised fertility. With the nation's conversion to Christianity, the evergreens came to symbolise the eternal life provided by faith in Jesus Christ. The origins for mistletoe also come from pagan culture and references fertility as well, though the exact reasons why have been seemingly lost to time.",facts about britain,2,Advanced,4,2

Unlike in America, Christmas celebrations didn't start until Christmas Day itself, being the first day of Christmas, and continued all the way to 5 January, which is known as Epiphany Eve or Twelfth Night. Shakespeare's play Twelfth Night helped to cement the importance of the day in the British culture.

In the early days of Christianity in England, Christmas was merely a day for a special worship service to recognise the birth of Christ, but over time, families began to use the holiday as a time to celebrate with food and drink (if you could afford it).

It may be one of the most recognizable patriotic songs in the world, but it has been sadly neglected by many native Brits.

You would think that a song this well-known would have an obvious origin, but strangely enough we don't know who wrote the words. Some attribute authorship to John Bull, others to Thomas Ravenscroft or Henry Purcell.
The phrase ""God Save the King"" dates back as far as a coronation anthem used for King Edgar in 973.
