My friends and I like sports very much. There is a big sports center near the University. You can play football, volleyball, basketball and tennis there. We like to play basketball. It is so exciting to bounce the ball up and down, to run with it, to jump, to throw the ball and see how it goes to the basket!
But, unfortunately, today the playground is busy. We must wait a little before we can play. Ben is good at running. He says: “Let’s have a little race.” We go to a big square behind the sports center and start to run. Ben runs with Alice. Alice wins. Ben is angry and wants another race. Ben runs with Joe. Joe wins. Ben is very sad. “My leg hurts,” he cries. We take him to the hospital and doctor says: “No more sports today!” 
We go to the nearest supermarket and buy some ice-cream. Ben can’t play basketball, but he can play karaoke! We go home, sing songs together, watch funny DVDs and enjoy tasty ice-cream. It’s so good to have good friends!
