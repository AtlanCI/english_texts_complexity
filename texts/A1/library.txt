Our Library
I study history at the University. My friend Yuko studies surgery, and Laura is interested in machine engineering. We all need much information about different scientific problems. So, we canâ€™t do without the Library. But we should remember some rules.
All students must have a library card. Students from other Universities cannot borrow books here. Even our students can borrow not more than three books. We can use computers only for work. We cannot surf the Internet for entertainment. We cannot eat or drink in the library. The books can become dirty and spoiled. If it is silence everywhere and no one runs, people study better. And mobile phones must certainly be off.
