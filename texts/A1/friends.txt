My name is Sonya. I am 20 and I come from Morocco. It is in the North of Africa. I am a student. I study History at the University. I have got many good friends here. They come from different parts of the world. Yuko is from Japan. She speaks Japanese. Laura comes from Italy. She speaks Italian. Toby and Roby come from Canada. They speak English and French. Jimmy is from India. He speaks Hindi and English. When we have long holidays, I miss them very much. I look at the map and say: “Good morning, Yuko and Jimmy! Good afternoon, Laura! Good evening, Toby and Roby!”
