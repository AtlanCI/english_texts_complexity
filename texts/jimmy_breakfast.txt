This is my friend Jimmy. He is from India. Jimmy is a vegetarian. The best breakfast for him is a glass of orange juice, two apples and three bananas. Jimmy  likes watermelons very much. A watermelon is green outside and red inside. It is hard and soft inside. It is juicy and sweet. What a lovely fruit!
