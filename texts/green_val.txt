Green Valley was a small village near the Icy Mountains. Mary lived happily there with her grandmother. But one day her grandma fell ill. She could not work anymore and earn enough money. She asked Mary to read a letter. It was her granny’s letter to Mary’s uncle. He was a rich man and lived in a big city. “You are asking him about the job in the circus?!” Mary was very much surprised. She did not want to leave her sweet home, did not want to part with her beloved grandmother, didn’t want to work in the circus. But her granny said: “You are not a child already, you are a grown-up young lady. You must go to the city.”
In the city everything was different: practically no trees and flowers in the streets, a lot of cars and high stone buildings and much noise. But people were as kind and friendly as in Green Valley. They explained her the way to the circus, and she easily found the place: turned right, followed a wide street, turned left, and here it was! 
Mary’s uncle was very glad to see her. He was Director of the circus.  He needed more people to care about animals. So, Mary’s duties were to clean the cages, to feed animals, to wash them. There were many different animals in the circus: monkeys, horses, elephants, tigers, lions. The job was hard and difficult. Mary did not complain.
Every week she wrote letters to her granny. In every letter she wrote “I am fine, I am happy.” But she was not happy at all. In the evening, standing behind the curtains during the performance, she dreamt about being on the stage…
One day Director said: “Today the King is going to visit our performance! You should act as well as you can!” Unfortunately, one of the most popular gymnasts broke her leg and no one else could work with horses instead of her. Suddenly Mary said: “I can. I know her program, I can try.” Her uncle had no choice and let her take part in the performance. Mary was beautiful that evening. She looked nice in the circus clothes and did all the tricks perfectly. The King liked her very much and applauded for a long time. When she came home, she wrote to her granny: “I am REALLY very happy!” And this time it was true.
