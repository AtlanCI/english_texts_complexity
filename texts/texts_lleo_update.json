Bugs suffer from memory problems when they don't hit the hay, leading to decreased concentration and communication problems. As a result, they can become confused. While humans need around eight hours' kip a night, the exact amount of time insects require is still not known.",

For a while, scientists couldn't decide what the strange little creature was because it had similarities with all three animal groups. For years, scientists had been studying the genome of the platypus to figure out which group it belonged to. Australia is home to some of the strangest animals in the world. As well as the duck-billed platypus, there are also kangaroos with pouches for carrying their offspring and the mild, tree-climbing koala bears. The isolation of the island has meant that many animals have evolved differently from other animals as they lived without fear of predators.",

The most important difference is that humans and whales live in different environments and whales have a special respiratory system that enables them to stay underwater for several minutes without breathing oxygen. For this reason, they are said to be voluntary breathers. That is, because of whales underwater environment, they must be conscious breathers.\nWhat is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep, whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can sleep is by remaining partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere of the whale's brain sleeps at a time, so they rest but are never completely asleep.",

Maybe most surprising are the islands that are built up from the bottom of the ocean from the skeletons of tiny sea animals called \"coral.\" As some corals die, others live on top of them. After thousands of years a coral island rises to the ocean surface.",

When the coral died, its shell remained, and other corals grew on top of it. Over those millions of years, the corals remained hardened and became cemented together.

He and his team have completed a sensational study into the collision of the two planets – and have shown that the impact could have been the starting point for life on Earth.

It's a kind of gravitational gap between Earth and the sun that not only offered Theia shelter, but also billions of tons of debris. Theia picked up more and more of this space muck – until it became so massive that it slowed down. It then lurched to the side and rammed into Earth at a speed of around 45,000 km/h.

The council had built a new road right through my back garden, with a traffic island in the middle, without asking for permission or even telling me they were going to do it. I now have to dodge the traffic every time I feed my chickens who live at the end of my garden. And when I protested, the council officials just laughed. Apparently, they've passed a new law that says they can use private land for road building without asking for the owner's consent or paying compensation. It's disgraceful. A spokesperson for the local council later said, \"I don't know why she's complaining. It's not a very busy road, and she can still get to the back of her garden to feed her chickens easily. What's the problem? Her chickens are all right. She still owns the land. It just has a road running through it now, that's all.\"",

He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found that a similar distribution applied. These days, the Pareto principle can be applied to a number of different scenarios. In business, directors often use the Pareto principle to analyse the company. For example, they may find that 80% of the sales come from 20% of their clients; or that 20% of the workforce creates 80% of the company's wealth.",

As the mayor of the district of Prague said, they give off a bad impression, are a \"nuisance\" and are antithetical to the square being \"more attractive for tourists\". Never has the sausage been so under attack.",

The parek is similar to a hot dog, and the utopenec, or \"drowned man\", is like a parek but is pickled in vinegar, oil, red pepper and onion. The kielbasa, which originated in Poland, is the most common – it's long and thick, and is usually grilled like the kind I'd eaten at Wenceslas Square.\nThe following day, I met up with two acquaintances. When I mentioned that I had planned to explore the sausage side of the city, they had a warning for me.\n\"Just don't eat any sausages on Wenceslas Square during the day, only at 1 a.m.,\" she said.\nThen she added: \"You haven't eaten there during the day, have you?\" I paused. \"Um, no... I would never.\"",

The cost includes five nights 5* accommodation, a trip to some hot springs and…a T-shirt. As part of the jump, a helicopter ride takes you to the Villarrica volcano. Once you're at the drop zone, you leap off the helicopter and fall into the volcano, coming within 215 metres of the burning lava. Finally, you enjoy the ride back to the airport flying at 130 kph and dangling from a rope 100 metres below the chopper. If you sit there wondering, 'Hang on, could I die?' then don't worry, because the company's answered that for you. 'Yes. You could. You'll be signing a waiver, so we're cool.'",

In fact, it began as independent walls for different states when it was first built, and did not become the \"Great\" wall until the Qin Dynasty. One of the myths associated with the Great Wall of China is that it is the only man-made structure that can be seen from the moon with the naked eye. The legend originated in Richard Halliburton's 1938 book Second Book of Marvels. However, this myth is simply not true. A more plausible assumption would be to say that the Great Wall can be visible from a low orbit of the earth which is not unique in this regard as many other artificial constructions can be seen from that height.",

Sculptures come in all sizes, shapes, textures, and materials. Sculptors may use soft materials such as clay, wax, or wood or harder materials such as stone or metal. Sometimes the materials aren't even meant to last. One artist makes sculptures out of milk!",

This 80 to 40 is the magic range and it can increase the life of your battery by as much as four times. When you consider that the price of a new battery can cost over 200 dollars, you can save a lot of money. What makes a big difference in battery life? It's stress on the battery. The higher the percentage of the charge, the higher the voltage level. Storing more voltage causes more stress on the battery. Another source of stress for your battery is heat.

But he admitted that leaving the customs union, inside which EU countries negotiate trade deals collectively and set common external tariffs, would reduce GDP by between 1 and 1.2% in the long term. So far Davis and Theresa May have not said whether they believe Britain ought to withdraw from the union, with some ministers in government warning that the move would cause a huge extra burden on exporters.",

In infancy, boys cry more, take longer to settle, are slower to learn to walk, talk and potty train. They have more difficulty adapting to school. Reading, writing, sitting still all come harder to small boys. Socially, too, they lag behind girls. Behavioural problems and mental illnesses are more common at all ages in boys than girls. In adolescence, boys do less well at school, leave school earlier, and are more likely than girls to die, in road accidents, from substance abuse, in fights and by suicide.

First, a happy spouse is a better caretaker; he or she is more likely to have the emotional energy to look after a significant other. Secondly, happy spouses make life easier for their partners because their partners aren't stressed by the fact that their closest companion is always in a bad mood, and they're not exhausted by efforts to jolly them along or under constant pressure not to upset them. One of the ways the researchers think this works is that the happy soul becomes a proxy for their partner, so the gloomy individual behaves as a non-gloomy person would. \"It's compensatory,\" says Chopik. \"Another person's happiness is filling you up, so you do these healthy things.\"",

The evidence is compelling – research shows pet owners tend to visit doctors less. Owning a pet lowers the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol and reduces blood pressure. It also reduces stress and makes people feel less lonely. The strong attachment a person forms to a pet is associated with lower levels of depression and greater self-esteem.

Then, he added a spiderwort sprout at the bottom with the help of wires. He opened it back up twelve years later to add a little water, and hasn't touched it since — but it continues to grow. It all comes down to science: Since the bottle was sealed and placed in a sunny corner, it became a self-sufficient ecosystem using photosynthesis. The plants acquire energy from the sunlight and moisture build ups and \"rains\" down to water the plant. Meanwhile bacteria in the compost breaks down dead plants.

And if they're angry with you, instead of talking about the problem, they might give you the silent treatment, make sarcastic comments every now and then, or worse, do something that could actually hurt you. \"Passive-aggressive people express their anger in indirect ways,\" author Loriann Oberlin explained. \"Behind the smile, a hidden knife!\" as the ancient Chinese proverb goes.",

Make sure that wherever you are – in the bathroom, at the gym – you have some way to take a note when tasks spring to mind. The second is to keep matters simple.

Dozens of different languages are spoken in Ottawa. But most people speak either French or English, the official languages of Canada. Many years ago French explorers and hunters traveled through the area that is now Ottawa. Only a few people lived there until the early 1800s. By that time the British ruled the territory. They decided they wanted a route for their ships to be able to travel from the Ottawa River to Lake Ontario, so they built the Rideau Canal.",

But it was another 70 years before the French settled in the area. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain founded the city of Quebec, establishing the first permanent colony in the region. It served as a fur-trading post for beaver, mink, and other pelts. During the next 150 years, the French and British fought over Quebec and Montreal. Eventually, a treaty in 1763 granted the area to the British. During the American Revolution, the American colonists tried to seize control of the area. But the British held onto it. Eight out of every ten people in Quebec are of French ancestry. Because of this, both French and English are spoken in Quebec.",

Yes, that includes hotels. The Tube is especially notorious for not being air conditioned. You will roast on warm days, and the real struggle is not being able to cool off long enough to stop sweating. British people are used to this and revel in the long summer days they are blessed with.

The 'hop on, hop off' design allowed for rapid use of the bus outside designated stops and was a large factor in its enduring popularity, despite the safety risk. Although production ceased in the 1960s, the bus survived the privatisation of London Transport and was even re-furbished to extend its life. The last bus was taken out of service in 2005, although a heritage route still allows visitors to ride this classic bus.",

The first route was from Paddington station to the Bank of England at a fare of one shilling. Since this is almost £40 today, the stop at the bank was probably necessary. He borrowed the name for his service from the French too, which became contracted to 'bus' quite quickly. Other similar services followed, and in 1855 a joint Anglo French company bought out almost all the services and formed a monopoly. By the early 20th century, the company was operating a mixed fleet of horse-drawn and motorised buses. In 1912 it was bought out by the operators of the London Underground and the joint business soon became known as London Transport.",

The scientists say the reason for the improvement is a reduction in the release of man-made chemicals into Earth's atmosphere. These chemicals are called chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs for short.\n\"It's a big surprise,\" said Susan Solomon, the lead writer of the report. \"I didn't think it would be this early,\" she said. Solomon is an atmospheric chemist and works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nResearchers first discovered the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica more than 30 years ago.",

This means many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. So, here's a quick tip: when you're packing to come here, whatever the season, you should bring all of your clothes just in case!",

We often ask our neighbours if they can put them in the field opposite more often to complete the quintessentially English view with the cows munching away on the grass in the foreground and the South Downs in the distance. The farmer separates them from their mothers at quite a young age so they can control the amount of milk they drink. If they were left with their mothers apparently they'd drink too much of his profits and get a bit too fat.",

According to the research, which was published in The Journal of Pediatrics in 2014, 60 per cent of children who said they never ate family meals were overweight. Interestingly, 10 years later, 29 percent of these children who had participated had become obese. Even eating meals as a family as infrequently as once or twice a week was found to significantly reduce the chance of children becoming overweight 10 years on, compared to those children who never ate meals as a family during their childhood. The researchers suggest their findings are a result of family meals being more likely to be healthy, children being exposed to a healthy model of eating into adulthood.",

Soup and similar dishes provide us with nourishment, so they come first to stuff ourselves and stop feeling hungry. Whereas dessert is a pleasure and the size of the dessert plate is in fact directly proportional to appetite. So, if you want a big dessert plate, there's only one solution - eat your meal backwards!",

It can be composed of mountains, plateaus, hills or plains. Hills are actually very tall mountains but whose rocks and rugged peaks have eroded over millions of years by wind, water, cold and other conditions. In other words, they have shrunk. Some hills measure less than five hundred feet and are as flat as a pancake. However, the earth's surface is never fixed. It keeps evolving continually and imperceptibly and new formations are being formed. People tended to inhabit hills with various imaginary creatures such as jolly goblins or laborious gnomes who dig winding tunnels. Nonsense! There are only rocks, rocks and more rocks both inside and outside.",

As for the night it was Egyptian astronomers who noted that the stars rose in the east and set in the west. They noticed that one of these stars, the North Star, didn't move and other stars rotated around it. They chose it to be a point of reference. They divided up the sky into 36 sequences. When observing the summer sky, Egyptian astronomers noted that only twelve sequences of the sky crossed the North Star. So, they assigned each of these equal sequences one hour, or twelve hours for the whole night. Then they figured that the day would be no different and allocated twelve hours for the daytime as well. A day of 24 hours was born.",

For instance, the world's oldest known turtle died at the age of at least 188. Scientists believe that man's natural life span is 120 years. Along with turtles and elephants, humans are destined to live the longest. The explanation for difference in life expectancy is that for every species the aging process is 'programmed' in advance. However, this process can be disrupted and thus life expectancy is shorten, for example due to a bad habit, malnutrition or a disease. Thanks to advances in medicine, better standard of living, the life expectancy of humans has greatly increased.",

It wasn't until the 17th century that Galileo, Pascal and Torricelli discovered that wind was more than a simple draught. The temperature of air depends on the intensity of the sun's rays. Wind comes from cold areas, where the air is heavier, and blows towards warmer areas, where it is lighter. The greater the pressure between cold and warm air currents, the stronger the wind.

Our eyes can't focus properly because our head is moving around due to the speed at which the car is moving. Finally, the pressure sensors embedded in soles of our feet help us to maintain the balance while we are on the ground.

Yet it's taken century to figure out that it's not enough to attach wings to our back and fly like a bird. When an airplane first accelerates, the air around the plane's wings is divided into two parts, moving at two different speeds. As the wings are slightly curved on top, air is passing over the wing, pushed upwards, and the area of low pressure is created. Meanwhile, the opposite action is taken underneath. Air passing under the wing thrusts downwards, exerting higher pressure on the wing, which creates lift. All this helps push the airplane to sky. In other words, air contains elements of force so that a plane can take off and maintain its altitude.",

Although he turned only fourteen, he had to go out to work in order to help his dad to support the huge family. He was the oldest boy and in Thailand it's common for children to work at fourteen. To begin with, he sold ice creams in the street, later he got a job selling cloth from door to door around the area. ",
