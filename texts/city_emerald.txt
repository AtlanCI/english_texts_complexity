At last Elly and her friends came up to the walls of the City of Emeralds. They walked up to the soldier at the door and asked to see the Wizard. The soldier near the door gave them glasses and asked to wear them in the city. It was the most beautiful place they ever saw in their lives. The soldier opened the door for them and they went in. Everything was beautiful in the City of Emeralds and everything was green. There were green marble houses along the streets. The houses were decorated with sparkling emeralds.
People in the city believed the Great Wizard was the cleverest of all. He was very kind and helped a lot of people. But nobody knew how he really looked like. He was different to different people: sometimes he looked like an animal and had two heads, five eyes and five legs. Sometimes he looked like a beautiful lady. Every day he invented something new.
A little man dressed in a long green robe led Elly and her friends to a large round room. The Great Wizard sat on a marble throne and nodded his head as he spoke. The Wizard listened to Elly attentively. He did not agree to help them unless they brought the broomstick of the wicked Witch of the West. She was the last wicked witch in the environment. If she does not have her broomstick, she will lose her magic power.
So, Elly and her friends had a new difficult task. They must do all their best to accomplish it!
