This story is set in England, many years ago. At this time, London often had bad fogs in the winter. This fog was a very thick, dirty mist. It was difficult to see or breathe in these fogs. Arthur Kipps is the hero in this story. Arthur is twenty-three years old. He is soon to be married. His fiancee, the woman he is going to marry, is called Stella. Arthur works as a solicitor in London. He helps people with their legal business. For example, he writes the documents when land or buildings are bought or sold. He also prepares wills. These papers say who people want to give their money or property to when they die. When someone dies, the solicitor sometimes goes to their funeral. Later, the solicitor arranges for their money or property to be given to the dead person's family.
