In my dream, I was on the beach in Hawaii. The hot sun was shining on my face. The sound of the sea was all around me.
Three weeks ago, I had been lying on a beach in Hawaii. But I was not in Hawaii now. I was dreaming in my office in Los Angeles. I had returned from my holiday and there was no work for me.
Nobody wanted to hire me. I went to my office every day, but the telephone didn't ring. So I slept in my chair and I dreamt about Hawaii.
I was dreaming a wonderful dream. The sun was hot. The noise of the sea was loud and there was a beautiful woman standing next to me.
Suddenly, there was a voice in my dream. Somebody was calling my name.
'Mr Samuel! Mr Samuel, wake up! Please, wake up! I want to talk to you.'
