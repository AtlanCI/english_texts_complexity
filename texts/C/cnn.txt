CNN has appointed a former Trump administration official with no journalism experience as a political editor, provoking consternation among the broadcaster’s staff and Democrat politicians.
Sarah Isgur Flores, who served as chief spokeswoman and senior adviser for the US Department of Justice under attorney general Jeff Sessions, is to join the network to coordinate coverage of the 2020 presidential election.
Ms Isgur Flores has previously been communications director for Republican National Committee and worked on the campaign teams of former presidential hopefuls Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz.
CNN employees have reportedly been unsettled by the appointment of an outspoken conservative and long-time Republican political operative to a senior editorial position.
“The reaction has been strong,” said Brian Stelter, the network’s chief media correspondent. “CNN employees are concerned, according to numerous people who reached out to me on Tuesday.
“They are asking what Isgur's role will be and questioning whether her sudden leap from the Trump administration to the CNN newsroom is an ethical breach.”
