Elly and her friends went towards the west as quickly as they could. Soon they were very tired and decided to rest. Elly, Toto and the Lion laid down on the soft grass and were very soon asleep. The Tin Man and the Scarecrow stood guard.
The Wicked Witch of the West had only one eye. But it was as powerful as a telescope and could see anywhere. She noticed Elly’s magic shoes. The Witch dreamt about them for a long time. She called the Flying Monkeys and ordered them to catch the girl and bring her to the Witch’s castle.
The Flying Monkeys were very quick and unexpected. The Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow fought a hard battle, but they could not defend Elly. The Monkeys picked her up and flew back to the castle.
The Witch asked Elly for the shoes, but Elly didn’t take them off. Then the Wicked Witch asked the Monkeys to grab Toto and kill him. She knew that Elly loved Toto and was ready to do everything to keep him alive. Everything - that is to give the magic shoes, too!
But the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow were already here, ready to rescue the girl and the dog. When the Monkeys tried to catch Toto, another hard battle started. Elly wanted to help her friends. She grabbed a bucket of water and threw it on the Witch.The Witch cried loudly and disappeared! All creatures of the castle were happy. Elly took the Witch’s broom. The task of the Great Wizard was accomplished. They could go back to the City of Emerald!
