The weather can be very different. Toby and Roby live in Canada, where it is very cold in winter. There is much snow in the streets. When there is too much snow on the road, they can’t even drive to the supermarket and buy food. Laura lives in Italy. It is warm and sunny there. It does not rain often. It’s great weather to have picnics with friends! Jimmy lives in India. Sometimes there are heavy rains there. They are called “tropical rains”. In such a weather he likes to look in the sky. The clouds are very interesting – they look like horses, dragons and other funny creatures.
I live in hot Morocco, but I like rains, too. You ask me, why? Because after it we can see a rainbow!
