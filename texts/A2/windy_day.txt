Once upon a time there lived a girl named Elly.  She lived with her parents in a small town in Kansas, in the heart of the great American prairies. Elly was a happy girl, she laughed a lot. She had a funny dog, Toto. Every day they played together outside. One day it was very windy and Elly was scared. She ran into the house and Toto followed her. Suddenly a large cyclone picked the house up, and the house started to fly with Elly and Toto still inside!  It carried them high into the sky. Elly came up to the window and looked down. She didn’t like what she saw. There was a green wood and a long river. She didn’t know where she was. After several days, the house landed with a crash.
Elly walked to the door. She was in a strange land. There was a crowd of little people standing before her. They were colorfully dressed. Their leader, the Mayor, made a step forward and said: “Thank you very much for killing the Wicked Witch!” Elly understood nothing. The Mayor pointed to the corner of the house where one could see two feet in red shoes and explained: “Your house landed on top of the Witch. For many years she treated us badly, like slaves. Today you made us free. That is why we are so grateful to you.” Then the leader of the little people presented Elly with the red shoes that the Wicked Witch usually wore. Elly thanked him and put the shoes on. They fit her perfectly! The Mayor said they were magic.
Then she asked the crowd how she could get back to Kansas. They could not answer her question. But the Mayor had a wonderful idea. There was the Great Wizard who was very powerful and lived in the city of Emeralds. Perhaps, he could help her. To find the city of Emeralds, Elly must follow the Yellow Brick Road. The crowd led Elly to that very road. She waved them good-bye and started her long and difficult way home.
