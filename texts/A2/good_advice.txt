My mom is a doctor. I know many useful things from her. My friend Toby often catches cold. I tell him: “Stay at home, drink hot tea with honey and eat lemons!” When my friend Laura has a headache, I advise her not to listen to loud music and sleep more. When Yuko has a toothache, I say: “Don’t eat sweets! Eat more vegetables and fruit.” Roby wants to lose weight. He is very fat. It is very difficult for him to walk and run fast. I advise him to do much sports.
It’s so good to help friends!
And what profession would you like to choose?
