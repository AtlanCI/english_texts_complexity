Elly and Toto followed the Yellow Brick Road when suddenly they heard: “Hello!” It was a Scarecrow. They were surprised by the fact that he could speak. But everything can happen in the magic land where witches and wizards live.
The Scarecrow explained that he was stuffed with straw, could not think well and needed some brains. Elly invited him to join their walk to the City of Emerald. Now there were three of them.
Soon they came up to the forest. When they walked by they heard a noise. In the middle of the trees stood a man made of tin. He could not move and prayed for oil. Elly found some oil and washed the Tin Man with it. Now he could move and speak easily and properly. He thanked Elly and explained: “Every day I chop down trees in the forest. This is my job. But suddenly it started to rain. As a result I rusted so badly!” 
The Tin Man had a dream. A girl, he once loved, stole his heart. He wanted to get his heart back. Elly and the Scarecrow invited him to join them on the trip to see the Great Wizard. The Tin Man happily agreed.
They traveled for many miles and finally came to a thickly wooded forest. There they met a lion. The Lion was born a coward. His entire life he wished to have courage. Only courage could help him be the real King of Animals. Elly told tim of the Wizard. So, the Lion joined them on their journey down the Yellow Brick Road.
